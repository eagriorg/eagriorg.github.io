				<p align="justify"><strong>COMMUNICATION</strong><br />
				  According  to Leagans (1961), Communication is the process by which two or more people  exchange ideas, facts, feelings or impressions in ways that each gains a common  understanding of the meaning, intent and use of messages. The term  'communication' stems from the Latin word 'communis'-meaning' 'common'.  Communication, then, is a conscious attempt to share information, ideas,  attitudes and the like with others.  In  essence it is the act of getting a <strong><em>sender</em></strong> and <em>a<strong> receiver</strong> </em> tuned together for a particular message, or a  series of message. &quot;Communication means the movement of knowledge to  people in such ways that they act on that knowledge to achieve some useful  result. This result may range all the way from a small improvement in doing  some productive task, to the generation of a sense of national unity and  strength in a country.  Communication in  this sense includes the whole learning process. It encompasses the teacher- the  message or material to be taught- the means or media used to carry the message  -the treatment given by those media- the learning achieved by the audience or  student- and the actions by which the learning is put into practice&quot;.  (Winfield (1957). <br />
				  Good communication does not consist  merely of giving orders, but of creating   understanding. It does not consist merely of imparting knowledge, but of  helping people gain a clear view of the meaning of knowledge. Most of the  progress in the future will stem from better technology and greater skill in  communicating it to others. Too many people saying the wrong things at the  wrong time, in the wrong way, to the wrong people, slows down progress. What is  needed is more people saying the right things at the right time, in the right  way, to the right people. This is the formula for good communication.<br />

				  <li>Communication varies the aspirations of the people</li>
				  <li>Communication is essential for all human activities</li>

			    </ol>
				<p align="justify">              This is the person  who starts the process of communication in operation. He is the source or  originator of messages. He is the sender of messages. He is the first to give  expression to message intended to reach an audience in a manner that results in  correct interpretation and desirable response. When a communicator does not  hold the confidence of his audience, communication as conceived will not take  place.<strong></strong></p>
				<p align="justify">The following  are<strong> the good qualities of a good  communicator :</strong></p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>1. The Communicator Knows -</strong></p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>

				    <li>the needs, interests, abilities etc. of the audience.</li>
				    <li>the content, validity, usefulness and importance of the  message</li>
				    <li>the channels that will reach the audience and their  usefulness</li>
				    <li>the tactics of organising and treating  the message</li>
				    <li>his/her professional abilities and limitations.</li>

				    <li>the specific message and its effects in helping the  people </li>
				    <li>the entirety of communication process</li>
				    <li>the proper use and limitation of communication  channels.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>3. The communicator prepares -</strong></p>

				    <li>a specific teaching plan for communication</li>
				    <li>materials and equipments needed for communication</li>
				    <li>a plan for evaluation of results.</li>

			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="justify">In contrast  to the above, the following are<strong> the qualities of a poor communicator :</strong></p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul type="disc">
				    <li>Fail to have ideas to present that are really useful       to the audience.</li>
				    <li>Fail to give the complete story and show its       relationship to people's problems</li>

			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>2. Message or content</strong><br />
				  A message is the information  communicator wishes his audience to receive, understand, accept and act upon.  Messages, for example, may consist of statements of scientific facts about  agriculture, sanitation or nutrition; description of action being taken by  individuals, groups or committees ; reasons why certain kinds of action should  be taken ; or steps necessary in taking given kinds of action.<br />
  <strong>Features of a good message</strong><br />
  <strong>A good message must be - </strong></p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul type="disc">
				    <li>in line with the objectives to be attained.</li>
				    <li>clearly understandable by the audience</li>
				    <li>in line with the mental, social, economic and       physical capabilities of the audience</li>
				    <li>significant-economically, socially or aesthetically       to the needs, interests and values of the audience.</li>
				    <li>specific in terms of audience and locale</li>
				    <li>accurate so as to be scientifically sound, factual and       current in nature.</li>
				    <li>appropriate to the channel selected.</li>
				    <li>appealing and attractive to the audience signifying       the utility values and immediacy  of       use.</li>
				    <li>adequate in such a way to have effective       proportionate combination of principle and practice manageable so as to be       handled by the communicator within the resources availability.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>In contrast, poor communicators often  commit the following which  mar the  effectiveness of message sending :</strong></p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <ul>
				      <li>Fail to clearly separate the key message from the  supporting content or subject-matter.</li>
				      <li>Fail to prepare and organise their message properly.</li>
				      <li>Use inaccurate of 'fuzzy' symbols-words, visuals, or  real objects-to represent the message.</li>
				      <li>Fail to select messages that are sharply in line with  the felt needs of the audience.</li>
				      <li>Fail to present the message objectively-present the  material, often biased, to support only one side of the proposition.</li>
				      <li>Fail to view the message from the standpoint of the  audience.</li>
				      <li>Fail to time the message properly within a presentation  or within a total programme.</li>
			        </ul>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">                 Selecting and 'packaging'  messages so they have a good chance of being understood, accepted and acted  upon when received is a crucial step in the communication process. It is one of  the six keys to success in efforts to influence people to change their ways of  thinking and of doing, that lead to   social and economic improvement.<br />
                    <strong>3.</strong> <strong> Channels of Communication</strong><br />
				  The sender and the receiver of  messages must be connected or 'tuned' with each other. For this purpose,  channels of communication are necessary. They are the physical bridges between  the sender and the receiver of messages-the avenues between a communicator and  an audience on which messages  travel to  and for. They are the transmission lines used for carrying messages  to their destination. Thus, the channels  serve as essential tools of the communicator.<br />
				  A channel may be anything used by a  sender of messages to connect him with intended receivers. The crucial point is  that he must get in contact with his audience. The message must get through.        <br />
				  However, channels are no good without  careful direction or use in the right way, at the right time, to do the right  job, for the right purpose with the right audience, all in relation to the  right message. So, proper selection and use of channels constitutes a third  determinant of successful communication. Without proper use of channels,  messages,  no matter how important, will  not get through to the intended audience.<br />
				  Many obstructions can enter channels. These  are often referred to as <strong>'noise'</strong> -  that is, some obstruction that prevents the message from being heard by or  carried over clearly to the audience. 'Noise' emerges from a wide range of  sources and causes. </p>
				<p align="justify">Sources and causes for noise:</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <ul>
				      <li><strong><em>Failure of a channel to reach the intended  audience</em></strong><em>.</em> Usually, no one  channel will reach an entire audience. Some examples: Meetings-all people  cannot or may not attend. Radio-all people do not have access to a receiving  set or may not be tuned in if they did. <strong>Written</strong><em> <strong>material</strong>-</em>many  people cannot read, and others may not.</li>
			        </ul>
			      </ul>
				  <ul>
				    <ul>
				      <li><strong><em>Failure on the part of a communicator to  handle channels skillfully</em></strong><em>. </em> If a meeting, tour, radio programme or any  other channel is not used according to good procedure and technique, its  potential for carrying a message is dissipated.</li>
			        </ul>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <ul>
				      <li><strong><em>Failure to select channels appropriates to  the objective of a communicator</em></strong><em>. </em>All  channels are not equally useful in attaining  a specific objective.</li>
			        </ul>
			      </ul>
				  <ul>
				    <ul>
				      <li><strong><em>Failure to use channels in accordance with  the abilities of the audience</em></strong><em>.</em> Written materials, for example, cannot serve as useful channels for  communicating information to people who are unable to read or to understand the  level of complexity  or abstraction of  the message.</li>
			        </ul>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <ul>
				      <li><strong><em>Failure to avoid physical distraction.</em></strong> When using the channel of meetings, for example, distractions including people  moving in and out, loud noises in or out of the group,  heat, lighting, crowded  condition and many other forms of distraction  often obstruct successful message sending.</li>
			        </ul>
			      </ul>
				  <ul>
				    <ul>
				      <li><strong><em>Failure of an audience to listen or look  carefully</em></strong><em>.</em> The only messages  that get through to an audience are those which are heard, seen or experienced.  An  unfortunate tendency of people  is  not to give undivided attention to  the communicator. This is a powerful obstruction that prevents messages from  reaching desired destination.</li>
			        </ul>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <ul>
				      <li><strong>F<em>ailure to use enough channels in parallel</em></strong><em>.</em> The more channels a communicator uses  in parallel or at about the same time,. the more chances he has for the message  getting through and being properly received .   No single channel will ordinarily reach all people who need to receive a  message. Research indicates that up to five or six channels used in combination  are often necessary to get a message through to large numbers of people with  enough impact to influence significant changes in behaviour.</li>
			        </ul>
			      </ul>
				  <ul>
				    <ul>
				      <li><strong><em>Use of too many channels in a series</em></strong><em>.</em> An important principle of  communication is that the more channels used in a series the less chance a  communicator has for getting his message through to the intended audience. In  this context, the following principles are to be borne in mind : (1) The more  steps by which the communicator is removed from his intended receiver, the  greater are his chances of losing the proper message. (2) When lines of  communication get too long for assured communication they can be improved in  two primary ways : (a) by using additional channels in parallel, and (b) by  eliminating some of the channels in the series.</li>
			        </ul>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>4. Treatment of Messages</strong><br />
				  Treatment has to do with the way  a message is handled to get the information across to an audience. It relates  to the technique, or details of procedure, or manner of performance, essential  to expertness in presenting messages. Hence, treatment deals with the design of  methods for presending messages. Designing the methods for treating messages  does not relate to formulation of the message or to the selection of channels,  but to the technique employed for presentation within the situation provided by  a message and a channel.<br />
				  The purpose of treatment is to  make the message clear, understandable and realistic to the audience. Designing  treatment usually requires original thinking, deep insight into the principles  of human behaviour and skill in creating and using refined techniques of message  presentation.<br />
				  Treatment of messages can be varied  in an almost infinite number of ways. The following are the three categories of  bases useful for varying treatment</p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>A. Matters of general organisation</strong><em>:</em></p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <ul>
				      <li>Repetition of frequency of mention of ideas and  concepts.</li>
			        </ul>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">                                Contrast of  ideas.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <ul>
				      <li>Chronological-compared to logical, compared to  psychological.</li>
				      <li>Presenting one side compared to two sides of an issue.</li>
				      <li>Emotional compared to logical appeals.</li>
				      <li>Starting with strong arguments compared to saving them  until the end of presentation.</li>
				      <li>Inductive compared to deductive.</li>
				      <li>Proceeding from the general to the specific and <em>vice versa.</em></li>
				      <li>Explicitly drawing conclusions compared to leaving  conclusions implicit for the audience to draw.</li>
			        </ul>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"> <br />
                    <strong>B. Matters of speaking and acting</strong><em>:</em></p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ol start="1" type="1">
				    <li>Limit the scope of presentation to a few basic ideas       and to the time allotted. Too many ideas at one time are confusing.</li>
				    <li>Be yourself. You can't be anyone else. Strive to be       clear, not clever.</li>
				    <li>Know the facts. Fuzziness means sure death to a       message.</li>
				    <li>Don't read your speech. People have more respect for       a communicator who is sure of his subject.</li>
				    <li>Know the audience. Each audience has its own       personality. Be responsive to it.</li>
				    <li>Avoid being condescending. Do not talk or act <em>down</em> to people, or over their       heads.</li>
				    <li>Decide on the dramatic effect desired. In addition to       the content of messages, a communicator should be concerned with       'showmanship'. Effective treatment requires sincerity, smoothness,       enthusiasm, warmth, flexibility and appropriateness of voice, gestures,       movements and tempo.</li>
				    <li>Use alternative communicators when appropriate, as in       group discussions, panels, interviews, etc.Remember that audience appeal       is a psychological bridge to getting a message delivered.</li>
				    <li>Quit on time. Communicators who stop when they are       'finished' are rewarded by audience goodwill.</li>
			      </ol>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>C. Matters of symbol variation and devices  for representing ideas</strong><em>:</em><br />
				  To represent ideas by effective treatment with reference to the  desired behavioural changes, a variety of audio-visual aids may be used.  Communicators should be aware that teaching message to achieve maximum audience  impact is a highly professional  task. Treatment  is a creative task that has to be 'tailor-made' for each instance of  communication.  Experience, thinking and  planning, skill in verbalisation and   writing, understanding of the principles of teaching and learning,  knowledge of a)  the subject  b) the audience to be reached and  c) skill in the use of channels etc will help  the communicator to undertake the process of message treatment.</p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>5. The Audience</strong><br />
                    <strong>         </strong>An  audience is the intended  receiver of message. It is the consumer of messages. It is the intended  respondent in message sending, and is assumed to be in a position to gain  economically, socially or in other ways by responding to the message in  particular ways. In good communication the communicator already identifies the  audience aims at..</p>
				<p align="justify">         The importance of clearly identifying  an audience cannot be over-stressed. The more homogeneous an audience, the  greater the chances of successful communication. Likewise, the more a  communicator knows about his audience and can pin-point its characteristics the  more likely he is to make an impact.</p>
				<p align="justify">The following  are some of the issues to clarify the nature of audience:</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Communication channels established by the social  organisation.</li>
				    <li>The system of values held by the audience-what they  think is important.</li>
				    <li>Forces influencing group conformity-custom, tradition  etc.</li>
				    <li>Individual personality factors-susceptibility to change  etc.</li>
				    <li>Native and acquired abilities.</li>
				    <li>Educational, economic and social levels.</li>
				    <li>Pressure of occupational responsibility-how busy or concerned  they are.</li>
				    <li>People's needs as they see them, and as the  professional communicator sees them.</li>
				    <li>Why the audience is in need of changed ways of  thinking, feeling  and doing.</li>
				    <li>How the audience views the situation.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">             It is useful to a communicator to understand  these and other traits of an audience in making his plan for communication.</p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>6. Audience Response</strong><br />
				  This is the terminating element in  communication applied to rural development programmes. Response by an audience  to messages received is in the form of some kind of action of some degree,  mentally or physically. Action, therefore, should be viewed as a product, not  as a process; it should be dealt with as an end, not as a means. Consequently,  the five elements hither to analysed <em>viz.,</em> communicator, message, channel, treatment and audience are intended to be  viewed as an organised scheme (means) for attaining the desired action (end) on  the part of an intended audience.</p>
				<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="justify">COMMUNICATION MODELS<br />
				  Models- Definitions<br />
				  In social science research, a model is  a tentative description of what a social process, say the communication process  or a system might be like. It is a tool of explanation and analyses, very often  in a diagrammatic form, to show how the various elements of a situation being  studied relate to each other. Models are not statements of reality. Only after  much further research and testing would the model be considered viable. It  could then be developed into a theory. The term model can also refer to a  particular process or object, which is used as a point of reference, when an  attempt to explain the unknown is being made. It comprises involving an analogy  to throw up the similarities between the phenomena to be explained and one,  which is well known, i.e., the model.<br />
				  Additionally the  model can be a person whose behaviour others wish to emulate or who they wish  to model themselves after.<br />
				  The simplest definition of a  model is that it is an analogue. A model is a relatively well-developed  analogy. Given two objects or processes, which are dissimilar in many respects,  one is an analogue of the other to the extent that the physical or logical  structure of one re-presents the physical or logical structure of the other.<br />
				  The advantage of models in  communication research is that it allows the researcher to account for  different variables in different communication situations. Models only  represent systems or processes. Since they are not real, they are just symbolic  ways of looking at systems to help us to think about them more lucidly. Again  since models do not show every part of a system, they are usually incomplete in  that sense. Even those that are shown are represented only in enough detail to  help us look at the processes or features in which we are interested. Mo0dels  give us an idea of complicated objects or events in a general way. They enable  us to see how a particular communication event fits into the general pattern.  They provide a classification for an orderly nature of events and suggest new  ways of looking at old problems, and familiar events. They help us by providing  a structure of reference for purposes of study.   Theories are not models and the most fundamental difference between a  theory and a model is that the former is an explanation whereas the latter is a  representation.<br />

				<p align="justify"><strong>Aristotle’s Model of Communication (Devito,  1978)</strong><br />
				  The earliest model of communication  was the symmetrical and simple model developed by the great Greek philosopher  Aristotle some 2000 years before. Aristotle in his model includes the five  essential elements of communication, i.e., the speaker, the speech or message,  the audience, the occasion, and the effect. In his rhetoric, Aristotle advises  the speaker on constructing a speech for different audiences on different  occasions for different effects. This model is most applicable to public  speaking.<br />
                  <strong>2. Lasswell's Model (1948)</strong> <br />
                  Lasswell has given us another simple  model. His model belongs specifically to the area of mass communication. He  argued that to understand the process of mass communication one needs to study  each of the stages in his mode. &quot;Who says what, in which channel, to whom,  and, with what effect.&quot;<br />

				  This is the verbal version of Shannon  and Weaver's original model. It is linear. It sees communication as the  transmission of message. It raises the issue of the effect rather than meaning.  Effect implies an observable and measurable change in the receiver that is  caused by identifiable elements in the process. A change in one of these elements  will change the effect. We can change the encoder. We can change the message.  We can change the channel, and each one of these changes would produce the  appropriate change in the effect. Most mass communication research has  implicitly followed this model.<br />
				  The work of  institutions and their process on the producers of communication on the  audience and how it is affected clearly derives from a process based linear  model.<br />
  <strong>Lasswell's model - comments</strong><br />
				  Until the 1960s Lasswell's four  questions (of who says what, by what channel, to whom and with what effect)  dominated studies of the mass media in France. Not only his exemplary  expression defines the different research areas for communication  investigations, but also seemed to prescribe the appropriate concepts and  methodological orientation to be followed. Thus, Lasswell's paradigm served the  entire scientific community of communication scholars.</p>

				  <img width="576" height="322" src="lec01_clip_image012.jpg" alt="ज़" /> </p>
				<p align="justify">        It was Harold Lasswell who first  precisely delineated the various elements, which constitute a  &quot;communication fact.&quot; According to him, one cannot suitably describe  a &quot;communication action&quot; without answering the following questions:  who said what, by what channel, to whom and with what effect?<br />
				  Identification of transmitters, analysis  of message content, study of transmission channels audience identification and  evaluation of effects; these are the five parameters of communication studies.  Michel Buhler represents the Lasswell model with the above diagram.<br />
				  Along with other developments during this  period were a number of writings that sought to provide description of the  nature of the communication process. One of the most often cited political  scientists Harold Lasswell advanced characterization communication in 1948 as  an out growth of his work in the area of propaganda. Lasswell provided a  general view of communication that extended well beyond the boundaries of  political science.  Lasswell's view of  communication, as had Aristotle has some two thousand years earlier, focused  primarily on verbal messages. It also emphasized the elements of speaker,  messages, and audience, but used different terms. Both men viewed communication  as a one way process in which one individual influenced others through  messages. Lasswell offered a broadened of definition channel to include mass  media along with verbal speech as a part of the communication process. His  approach also provided a more generalized view of the goal or effect of  communication than did the Aristotelian perspective. Lasswell's work suggested  that there could be a variety of outcomes or effects of communication such as  to inform, to entertain, to aggravate and to persuade (Brent, 1984).</p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>3. Shannon and Weaver  model   (1949)  </strong><br />
			    The preconception of the academic field  of mass communication were heavily influenced by the engineering model of  Shannon and Weaver (1949) Communication was conceived as a linear act of  transmission of a message from a source to a receiver via a signal producing  transmitter. A component called 'noise' acknowledged the presence of context in  the electrical engineering model.</p>
				<p align="justify">				  Shannon and Weaver’s mathematical  theory of communication (1949) is widely accepted as one of the main seeds out  of which communication studies have grown. It is a clear example of the process  school, seeing communication as the transmissions of messages. The work  developed during the Second World War in the Bell telephone laboratories in the  US and their main concern was to work out ways in which channels of  communication could be used most efficiently. For them, the main channels were  the telephone, cable and the radio wave. They produced a theory that enabled  them to approach the problem of how to send a maximum amount of information  along a given channel to carry information. This concentration on the channel  and its capacity is appropriate to their engineering and mathematical  background, but they claim that their theory is widely applicable over the  whole question of human communication.<br />
			    Shannon and Weaver's model (1949)  presents communication as a linear process. Its simplicity has attracted many  derivatives, and its linear process centered nature has attracted many critics.  Its obvious characteristics of simplicity and  linearity standout clearly.        <strong></strong></p>

				  <br />
				  Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver gave  this model. As the diagram above indicates, this communication model comprises  four elements. A source of information, with a greater or lesser number of  messages to communicate; a transmitter or sender with the capacity to transform  a message into a signal; a receiver which decodes the signal in order to  retrieve the initial message, and finally, the destination, a person or thing  for whom the message is intended. Communication, according to this model,  follows a simple left to right process. The information source (say speaker),  selects a desired message from all the possible messages. The message is sent  through a transmitter (microphone) and is changed into signals. A receiver (say  earphone), changed back into a message and given to the destination, a  listener, receives the signals. In the process of transmission, certain  distortions are added to the signal which are not part of the message and these  will be called noise.<br />
				  The basis of all contemporary Western  theories of Communication - Shannon- Weaver model stresses the idea of inside  and outside and assumes that communication is a lineal matching rather than  making. The information source changes the message into the signal, which is  actually sent over the communication channel from the transmitter to the  receiver. In the case of telephony the channel is a wire the signal a varying  electrical current on this wire, the transmitter is the set of devices  (telephone transmitter etc.) which change the sound pressure of the voice into  the varying electric current. In oral speech, the information source is the  brain, the transmitter is the voice mechanism producing the varying sound  pressure (the signal) which is transmitted through the air (the channel). In  radio, the channel is simply space, and the signal is the electromagnetic wave,  which is transmitted. The receiver is an inverse transmitter, changing the  transmitted signal back into a message and handing this message on to the  destination.<br />
				  In the process of being transmitted,  usually certain things are added to the signal, which were not intended by the  sender. These additions are distortion of sounds as in telephony, or static in  radios, or errors in transmission in telegraphy or facsimile etc., Such changes  in transmission signals are called noise.<br />
  <strong>Shannon   and Weaver's Model (1949) comments</strong><br />
				  Both European and American scholars  recognize that Shannon and Weaver's (1949) model provided the basic paradigm  for effects-oriented communication research by setting forth the main elements  (source, channel, messages, receiver) of a simple linear model of  communication. This model became tremendously popular with communication  researchers enabling the field of communication study to take off' about 30  years ago. It formed the main paradigm around which invisible college of  communication researcher formed. Less well known is the contribution by Shannon  and Weaver in defining the concept of information as a central notion for the  field of Communication. Shannon and Weaver's model was used in the field of  electronics for many purposes, form the design of telephone networks to  matrices of computer memories. An eminent Finnish scholar between the two  central concept (a) communication (b) informations has identified an important  distinction. These two concepts trace from Aristotle to the Shannon and Weaver  mathematical theory of a single transmission and to other models of information  and communication. Although Shannon and Weaver's concept of the probabilistic  model of communication has been fruitful in leading to further research, it was  never intended to describe linguistic information and human communication.

  <strong>C.E. Osgood - Schramm Model (1975)</strong><br />
				  To the circular  model, we have added boxes and arrows showing the influence of noise and  personality is a helix used as a model by Frank E.X. Dance. He felt that  circular models were better than straight - lines ones like Shannon- Weaver,  but that they had a built in error since they showed communication ending up  where it started off. In fact as an act of communication goes on, the noise  gets less (because the communicators get more used to handling the channel /  model) and personality becomes more helpful (because, as communicators get to  known each other and the subject, they adjust to each other and fill gaps in their  knowledge).<strong></strong></p>

				<p align="justify"><strong>5. Katz and Lazarfeld's Model (1955)</strong><br />
				  The model of 1955 was based on earlier  research in which they found that information presented on the mass media did  not have the reach and impact upon the receivers as previous views of  communication seemed to suggest it would. Specifically their research indicated  that political radio and print messages seemed to have a negligible effect on  individuals voting decisions.<br />
				  Their research also indicated that some  people were consistently more influential than others, leading them to conclude  that ideas often seemed to flow from radio to print to opinion leaders and from  them to the less active sections of the population - in a two-step flow.<br />

                    <strong>6. David Berlo's Model (1960)</strong><br />
				  In the last twenty-five years, a number of  models of communication have been developed by communicologists, each one  expanding the earlier presentation. David Berlo's model is one among them,  which has been profusely quoted and frequently mentioned in discussions. In his  book, “The Process of Communication” written in 1960, he presented this model  which has a close similarity to the earlier Aristotelian model, including the  traditional elements of source, message, channel and receiver.  Berlo's model attempts to explain the various  components in the communication process. For each of these basic components,  controlling factors were listed.<br />
  For each of these four components there are five elements that need to  be considered. The source and receiver are treated in essentially the same way.  To study either we need to consider their communication skills (speaking and  writing for the source and listening and reading for the receiver) their  attitudes, their knowledge, the social system of which they are a part and the  culture in which they operate. The message consists of both elements and  structure, each of which may be broken down into content, treatment and code.  For the channel, Berlo lists the five senses, emphasizing that the messages may  be sent and received by any and all of the senses.</p>

                    <strong>Fig. 25. David Berlo's Model</strong><br />
				  Berlo more than the others  emphasized the idea that communication was a process, and the idea that  “meanings are in people, not in words….” </p>

				  (Source: &quot;The process of  communication - An Introduction to Theory and Practice&quot; by David Berlo,  1960).<br />
				  His  model reinforced a shift away from views of communication that emphasized the  transmission of information to perspectives that focused on the interpretation  of information. Berlo writes, “People can have similar meanings only to the  extent that they have had similar experiences”. Berlo also felt that human  communication always had a purpose &quot;our basic purpose in communication is  to become an affecting agent, to affect others, our physical environment, and  ourselves. We communicate to influence to affect with intent&quot;.<br />
  <strong>7. Rogers and Kincaid Model (1981)</strong><br />
				  One of the more recent models of the  communication process is provided by Everett Rogers and D. Lawrence Kincaid  (1981). The authors described what they termed a convergence model of  communication that stressed the importance of information and the manner in  which information links individuals together in social networks. They described  communication as a process in which individuals create and share information  with one another in order to reach mutual understanding. This cyclical process  involves giving meaning to information that was exchanged between two or more  individuals as they move towards one another, and to unite in a common interest  or focus. In explaining the matter in which the convergence process was thought  to operate, they indicated that communication always begins with &quot;and  then---&quot; to remind us that something has occurred before we begin to  observe the process. Participant A may or may not consider the past before he  shares information (I1) with participant B. This individual must  perceive and then interpret the information which A creates to express his/her  thoughts, and then B may respond by creating information (I2) to  share with A Individual. A interprets this new information and then may express  himself again with more information (I3) about the same topic. Individual  B interprets this information, and they continue the process (I4……In)  until one or both become satisfied that they have reached a sufficient mutual  understanding of one another about the topic for the purpose at hand. As in a  number of early views, the convergence model explained communication in terms  of a progressive sending and receiving messages between tow individuals in  which the goal and predicted outcome are mutual understanding of a topic.  Although acknowledging the role of interpretive process that occur within  individuals, the Rogers and Kincaid view emphasised the information exchanges  and networks them. Their perspective also carried forth the view of  communication as a process rather than a single event, a point of view  emphasized in nearly all models in recent years.</p>

				<h4 align="justify">BARRIERS  TO COMMUNICATION</h4>
				<p align="justify">In  between the communicator and the receiver, certain barriers considerably affect  the quality of information transmission. Some of the major barriers are  discussed below.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ol start="1" type="1">
				    <li><strong>Filtering</strong></li>
			      </ol>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">        Because of the many other concerns  which constantly influence our ability to concentrate on what we hear, the  average listener will normally &quot;filter out&quot; certain things that he  hears. They will simply ignore a point made by the speaker, as though it had  never been presented. This can be deliberate or unintended.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ol start="2" type="1">
				    <li><strong>Distortion</strong></li>
			      </ol>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">        For the same reason, the human mind can  also distort what it hears. It is an unconscious process. Every person tends to  remember best what agrees with his own values.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ol start="3" type="1">
				    <li><strong>Communication       Overload</strong></li>
			      </ol>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">        Our minds can receive and retain only a  limited amount of information without showing strain. This is called channel  capacity. This ability can vary with different audiences. Overloading the  system will in effect below the mental fuse and defensively shut down the  communication process.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ol start="4" type="1">
				    <li><strong>Absence of       Redundancy</strong></li>
			      </ol>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">         It is the use of repetition. Even  under the best condition an audience can have problems grasping or fully  appreciating the significance of something new which has been presented to  them. By repeating it, or by illustrating it or by restating the same point in  different ways a speaker can make it easier for an audience to understand and  retain the information passed on by the speaker.</p>
