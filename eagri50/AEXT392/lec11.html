				<h4>DIFFUSION OF INNOVATIONS</h4>
				<p>            Diffusion is the process by which  an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the  members of a social system. It is a special type of communication, in that the  messages are concerned with new ideas.<br />
                    <strong>Elements in the diffusion of innovations :</strong><br />
				  The  four main elements in diffusion of innovations are</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>innovation</li>
				  <li>communication channels </li>
				  <li>time</li>
				  <li>social system.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>            The description for these elements  is  presented below:<br />
                    <strong>1) The innovation:</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>An  innovation is an idea, practice  or object  that is perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The  perceived newness of the idea for the individual determines his or her reaction  to it.  The &quot;newness&quot; aspect of  an innovation may be expressed in terms of knowledge, persuasion or a decision  to adopt. <br />
				  In this context, to know about the <strong>perceived attributes of innovation </strong> would be appropriate which are described in  the succeeding paras:<br />
				  a. Relative advantage: <br />
  <strong>            </strong>It  is the degree to which an innovation is perceived as better than the idea it  supersedes. The degree of relative advantage may be  measured in economic terms, but  social-prestige factors,  convenience and  satisfaction are also often the important components.<strong></strong><br />
  <strong>b. Compatibility:</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>It  is the degree to which an innovation is perceived as being consistent with the  existing values, past experiences and needs of potential adopters.<br />
  <strong>c. Complexity:</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>It  is the degree to which an innovation is perceived as difficult to understand  and use. In general, new ideas that are simpler to understand will be adopted  more rapidly than innovations that require the adopter to develop new skills  and understandings.<br />
  <strong>d. Trialability:</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong> It is the degree to which an innovation may be  experimented with on a limited basis. An innovation that is trialable  represents less uncertainty to the individual who is considering it for  adoption, as it is possible to learn by  doing.<br />
  <strong>e. Observability:</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong> It is the degree to which the results of an  innovation are visible to others. The easier it is for individuals to see the  results of an innovation, the more likely they are to adopt. </p>
				<p><strong>2) Communication channels:</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>A  communication channel is the means by which messages get from one individual to  another. The following classification of channels would help the communicator  to use them appropriately:<br />
                  <strong>i) Interpersonal channels - </strong> It refers to those which are used for face to  face communication between two or more individuals.<br />
                  <strong>ii) Mass media channels -  </strong>These enable the messages to reach a  larger, diverse audience simultaneously in a relatively shorter time. e.g.:  Radio and T.V.<br />
                  <strong>iii) Localite channels - </strong> They originate within the  social system of the receiver. eg:  neighbours, relatives, opinion leaders etc.<br />
                  <strong>iv)Cosmopolite channels - </strong>They  originate outside a particular social system. eg: Extension  worker, sales personnel etc.<br />
                  <strong>3. Time:</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong> It is an important element in the diffusion  process. Time is an obvious aspect of any communication process. Time does not  exist independently of events, but it is an aspect of every activity. The time  dimension is involved in diffusion  (i)  in the innovation - decision process, (ii) in the innovativeness of an  individual or other unit of adoption, and (iii) innovation's rate of adoption  in a system.<br />
                  <strong>4. Social System:</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>It  is defined as a set of interrelated units that are engaged in joint problem  solving to accomplish a common goal. The members or units of a social system  may be individuals, informal groups, organisations and / or subsystems. The  social system constitutes a boundary within which an innovation diffuses.<br />
                  <strong>INNOVATION - DECISION PROCESS</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong> As an alternative to the &quot;Stages in the  adoption process&quot; <em>viz.,</em>  Awareness, Interest, Evaluation, Trial and  Adoption, due to the advancements in diffusion research, currently&quot;  Innovation - Decision process&quot; is proposed which  enlightens   the sequential stages in the adoption - decisions made by individuals or  other units of adoption.<br />
                  The &quot;Innovation - Decision  Process&quot; is the process through which an individual (or other decision -  making unit) passes from first knowledge of an innovation, to forming an  attitude towards the innovation to a decision to adopt or reject, to implementation  of the new idea, and to confirmation of this decision.<br />
				  This process consists of a series of  actions and choices over time through which an individual or an organisation  evaluates a new idea and decides whether or not to incorporate the new idea  into on going practice.<br />
			    The conceptualization of the model  of the innovation decision process consist of the following five stages (as  illustrated in fig.27.)</p>
				<p><strong>Fig.27. Paradigm on Stages in the  Innovation-Decision Process</strong></p>
				<p><img src="untitled.jpg" alt="KJK" width="777" height="511" /><br />
                                </p>
				<div></div>
                 
                <p><strong>1. Knowledge stage:</strong><br />
    <strong>            </strong> Knowledge occurs when an individual (or the  decision - making unit) is exposed to the innovation's existence and gains some  understanding of how it functions.<br />
  The following  three types of knowledge possessed by an individual influence the decisions :</p>
<p>i). <strong>Awareness - knowledge</strong> motivates an  individual to seek  &quot;how-to&quot;  knowledge and principles knowledge. This type of information - seeking is  concentrated as the knowledge stage of the innovation - decision process, but  it may also occur at the persuasion and decision stages.<br />
  ii). <strong>How-to knowledge           </strong>consists  of  information necessary to use an innovation properly. When an adequate level of  how-to knowledge is not obtained prior to the trial and adoption of an  innovation, rejection or discontinuance is likely to result. Change agents  could perhaps play their distinctive role to concentrate on &quot;how-to knowledge&quot;  at the trial and decision stage in the process.<br />
  iii). <strong>Principles knowledge</strong> consists of  information dealing with the functioning principles underlying how the  innovation works. It is usually possible to adopt an innovation without  principles knowledge, but the danger of misusing the new idea is greater, and  discontinuance may result. The long-range competence of individuals to judge  future innovations is facilitated by principles knowledge.<br />
  <strong>2. Persuasion stage</strong><br />
  Persuasion occurs when an  individual (or other decision - making unit) forms a favourable or unfavourable  attitude toward the innovation.<strong></strong><br />
  <strong>          </strong>While the mental activity as the  knowledge stage was mainly cognitive (or knowing), the main type of thinking at  the persuasion function is affective (or feeling). At this stage, a general  perception of the innovation is developed. The individual becomes more  psychologically involved with the innovation and hence he or she seeks  information about the new idea.<strong></strong><br />
  <strong>3. Decision stage</strong><br />
  Decision occurs when an  individual (or other decision - making unit) engages in activities that lead to  a choice to adopt or reject the innovation.<strong></strong><br />
  Adoption is a decision  to make full use of an innovation as the best course of action available. Rejection  is a decision not to adopt an innovation.<br />
  The small - scale trial  is often part of the decision to adopt, and is important as a means to decrease  the perceived uncertainty of the innovation for the adopter.<br />
  <strong>4. Implementation stage:</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong> Implementation   occurs when an individual (or other decision - making unit) puts an  innovation into use. Until the implementation stage, the innovation-decision  process has been a strictly mental exercise. But implementation involves overt  behaviour change as the new idea is actually part into practice.<br />
  Problems of implementation are  likely to be more serious when the adopter is an organisation rather than an  individual. Reason is that in  an  organisational setting, a number of individuals are usually involved  in the innovation - decision process, and the  implementers are often a different set of people from the decision makers.<br />
  <strong>5. Confirmation stage:</strong><br />
  Confirmation occurs when an  individual (or other decision - making unit) seeks reinforcement of an  innovation - decision already made, but he or she may reverse this previous  decision if exposed to conflicting messages about the innovation.<br />
  The confirmation stage  continues after the decision to adopt or reject for an indefinite period in  time. At this stage, the change agents have the additional responsibility of  supporting messages to individuals who have previously adopted.<br />
  As a sequential effect,  there is a possibility for &quot;discontinuance&quot;. A discontinuance is a  decision to reject an innovation after having previously adopted it. There are  two types of discontinuances:<br />
  i). Replacement discontinuance - is a decision to reject an idea in order  to adopt a better idea that supersedes it.<br />
  ii).  Disenchantment discontinuance - is a decision to reject an idea as a result of  dissatisfaction with its performance.<br />
  <strong>ADOPTER CATEGORIES</strong><br />
  <strong>          </strong>There are different categories of farmers. According to Rogers (1971), the  farmers based on their innovativeness can be classified as<br />
  1. Innovators (Venturesome)<br />
  2. Early adopters (Respectable)<br />
  3. Early majority (Deliberate)<br />
  4. Late majority (Skeptical)</p>
<ol>
  <li>Laggards (Traditional)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Characteristics of farmers</strong><br />
  All individuals in a social system  do not adopt an innovation at the same time. Rather, they adopt in an ordered  time sequence, and they may be classified into adopter categories on the basis  of when they first begin using a new idea. In technology transfer programme, it  is of great practical utility for the extension workers to identify the  individuals who are likely to adopt innovations early and who may lag behind.<br />
  The adoption of an innovation over  time follows a normal, bell-shaped curve when plotted over time on frequency  basis. If the cumulative number of adopters is plotted, it results in an  S-shaped curve. The S-shaped curve rises slowly at first when there are few  adopters in a time period, accelerate to a maximum when about half of the  individuals in the system have adopted and then increases at a gradually slower  rate as the few remaining individuals finally adopt (Fig. 28.). The S-shaped  curve is like that of a 'learning curve' as propounded by the psychologists.  Each adoption in the social system is in a sense equivalent to a learning trial  by an individual.</p>
<p><strong>Fig.28. The bell shaped frequency curve and  the S-shaped cumulative curve </strong><br />
    <strong>                     for  adopter categories</strong><br />
    <img width="523" height="358" src="lec11_clip_image012.gif" alt="Book10" /><br clear="all" />
    <strong></strong><br />
  Both of these curves are for the  same data, the adoption of an innovation over time by the members of a social  system. But the bell-shaped curve shows these data in terms of the number of  individuals adopting each year, whereas the S-shaped curve shows these data on  cumulative basis.</p>
<p>            The distribution of adopters over  time closely approaches normality, and may be explained by the statistical concept  of normal curve. The distribution of the adopters  may be partitioned into five adopter  categories by using the mean (x) and standard deviation. The area lying to the  left of the mean time of adoption minus two standard deviations includes 2.5  per cent of the individuals who are the first to adopt an innovation and are  known as innovators. The next 13.5 per cent between the mean minus one standard  deviation and the mean minus two standard deviations to adopt the new idea are  called as early adopters. The next 34 per cent of the adopters between the mean  date of adoption and minus one standard deviation are known as early majority.  Between the mean and one standard deviation to the right of the mean are  located the next 34 per cent to adopt the new idea, the late majority. The last  16 per cent to the right of mean plus one standard deviation are the last to  adopt the innovation the laggards. The five-adopter categories are  conceptualized as ideal types and are presented in Figure29.</p>
<p><img width="576" height="267" src="lec11_clip_image014.gif" /><br clear="all" />
  Fig. 29. Adopter categorization on the basis of innovativeness<br />
  The innovativeness dimension, as  measured by the time at which an individual adopts an innovation, is  continuous. However, this variable may be partititioned into five adopter  categories by laying of standard deviations from the average time of adoption.</p>
<p>            The detailed information on the  characteristics of adopter categories is presented in the succeeding pages:<br />
    <strong>Innovators: Venturesome</strong><br />
  Observers have  noted that venturesomeness is almost an obsession with innovators. They are  eager to try new ideas. This interest leads them out of a local circle of peers  and  into   more  cosmopolite  social   relationships. Communication patterns and friendships among a clique of  innovators are common, eventhough the geographical distance between the  innovators may be great. Being an innovator has several prerequisites. These  include control of substantial financial resources to absorb the understand and  apply complex technical knowledge. <br />
  The salient value of the innovator  is venturesomeness. He desires the hazardous, the rash, the daring, and the  risky. The innovator also must be willing to accept an occasional setback when  one of the new ideas he adopts proves unsuccessful. <br />
  These are the first people to adopt  a new idea, much ahead of other people. They are very few in numbers, probably  not more than one or two in a community.<br />
  Characteristics:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Have larger farms.</li>
  <li>High net worth and risk capital.</li>
  <li>Willing to take risks.</li>
  <li>Usually not past middle age</li>
  <li>Generally well educated</li>
  <li>Have respect and prestige in progressive communities  but not in conservative type of communities.</li>
  <li>Mentally alert and actively seeking new ideas.</li>
  <li>Their sphere of influence and activity often goes  beyond the community boundaries.</li>
  <li>They have many formal and informal contact outside the  immediate locality.</li>
  <li>They often by-pass the local extension worker in  getting information from the originating sources, and may learn about new  things even before he does. They sometimes manage to get samples of seeds or  chemicals even before they are released for public use.</li>
  <li>They subscribe to many farm magazines and specialised  publications.</li>
  <li>Other farmers may watch the innovators and know what  they are doing but the innovators are not generally named by other farmers as  &quot;neighbours and friends&quot; to whom they go for information.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Early Adopter: Respectable</h2>
<p>            Early adopters are a more integrated  part of the local social system than are innovators. Whereas innovators are  cosmopolites, early adopters are localities. This adopter’s category, more than  any other, has the greatest degree of opinion leadership in most social  systems. Potential adopters look to early adopters for advice and information  about the innovation. The early adopter is considered by many as &quot;the man  to check with&quot; before using a new idea. This adopter category is generally  sought by change agents to be a local missionary for speeding the diffusion  process. Because early adopters are not too far ahead of the average individual  in innovativeness, they serve as a role model for many other members of a  social system. Members of a social system respect the early adopter.  The early adopter is respected by his peers.  He is the embodiment of successful and discrete use of new ideas. And the early  adopter knows that he must continue to earn this esteem of his colleagues if  his position in the social structure is to be maintained. <br />
    <strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Younger than those who have a slower adoption rate, but  not necessarily younger than the innovators</li>
  <li>They are not the persons who test the untried ideas but  they are quickest to use tried ideas in their own situations. </li>
  <li>Have large farms.</li>
  <li>Higher education than those who adopt more slowly.</li>
  <li>High income.</li>
  <li>They participate more in the format activities of the  community.</li>
  <li>They also participate more in government programmes.</li>
  <li>This group usually furnishes a disproportionate amount  of the formal leadership (elected positions) in the community.</li>
  <li>They read papers and farm journals and receive more  bulletins than people who adopt later.</li>
  <li>They may be regarded as community adoption leaders.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Early Majority: Deliberate (Local Adoption  Leaders)</strong><br />
  The early majority adopt new ideas  just before the average member of a social system. The early majority interact  frequently with their peers, but leadership position; are rarely held by them.  The early majority's unique position; between the very early and relatively  late to adopt make; them an important link in the diffusion process.</p>
<p>The early  majority may deliberate for some time before completely adopting a new idea.  Their innovation-decision is relatively longer than that of the innovator and  the early adopter. &quot;Be not the last to lay the old aside, nor the first by  which the new is tried&quot;, might be the motto of the early majority. They  follow with deliberate willingness in adopting innovations, but seldom lead.<br />
    <strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Slightly above average in age, education and farming  experience.</li>
  <li>They take a few more farm journals and bulletins than  the average.</li>
  <li>They have medium high social and economic status.</li>
  <li>Less active in formal groups than early adopters, but  more active than those adopting later.</li>
  <li>In many cases, they are not formal leaders in the  association</li>
  <li>They also attend extension meetings and farm demonstrations.</li>
  <li>They are most likely to be informal resources than  early adopters and innovators, and so cannot afford to make hasty or poor  decisions.</li>
  <li>They associate mainly with people of their own  community.</li>
  <li>They value highly the opinions their neighbours and  friends hold about them; for this is their main source of status and prestige.</li>
  <li>They are mostly mentioned as &quot;neighbours and  friends&quot; from whom the majority of farmers seek information.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Late Majority: Skeptical</strong><br />
  The late  majority adopt new ideas just after the average member of a social system.  Adoption may be both an economic necessity and the answer to increasing social  pressures. Innovations are approached with a skeptical and cautions air, and  the late majority do not adopt until most other in their social system have  done so. The weight of system norms must definitely favour the innovation  before the late majority are convinced. They can be persuaded of the utility of  new ideas, but the pressure of peers is necessary to motivate adoption.<br />
  <strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Those in this group have less education and are older  than the early majority.</li>
  <li>They form the major part 9( formal organisational  membership, although they participate less in such formal groups.</li>
  <li>They take fewer leadership roles than the earlier  adopters.</li>
  <li>They take and read fewer papers, magazines and  bulletins, than the early majority.</li>
  <li>They do not participate in as many activities outside  the community as do people that adopt earlier.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Laggards: Traditional</strong><br />
  Laggards are the last to adopt an  innovation. They possess almost no opinion leadership.  They are the most localite in their outlook  of all adopter categories, many are near isolates. The point of reference for  the laggard is the past. Decisions are usually made in terms of what has been  done in previous generations. This individual interacts primarily with others  who have traditional values. When laggards finally adopt an innovation, it may  already have been superseded by another more recent idea which the innovators  are already using. Laggards tend to be frankly suspicious of innovations,  innovators, and change agents. Their tradition direction slows the innovation  decision process to a crawl. Adoption lags far behind knowledge of the idea.  Alienation from a too-fast-moving world is apparent in much of the laggard's  outlook. While most individuals in a social system are looking to the road of  change ahead, the laggards has his attention fixed on the rear-view mirror.<br />
  <strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Least education.</li>
  <li>Oldest.</li>
  <li>Participate least in formal organisations, cooperatives  and government programmes.</li>
  <li>They hardly read farm magazines and bulletins.</li>
</ol>
