                  <strong>Journalism: Definition and meaning</strong><br />
                  Journalism  is that part of social activity, which is concerned, with the dissemination of  news and views about the society. Modern journalism feeds five departments of  mass communication. (1) Newspaper and periodicals, (2) Radio, (3) Television,  (4) Films and (5) Advertising.<br />
                  Journalism  is the systematic and reliable dissemination of public information, public  opinion and public entertainment by modern mass media of communication.<br />
                  In modern societies, journalism has become the  media of mass education providing supplementary education to students at all  stages and to the general masses - educated and uneducated.<br />
                  All activities concerned with the  communication of mass media is not journalism but the part of that activity  involving writing, preparation and production of the communication messages is  journalism.  Thus, essentially  journalists are writers, authors, reporters, correspondents, editors,  sub-editors, interviewers, storywriters, scriptwriters, scenario editors and  allied specialists.<br />
                  <strong>Importance</strong><br />
                The mass  media are capable of reaching vast widespread audiences, thanks to fast moving  newspapers/radio broadcasts, TV telecast and the celluloid films. A single  broadcasting network to day can reach millions of people at the same time. The  world stands of the threshold of new communication systems which enable large  number of citizens to regularly and effectively interact with each other. To  make full use of the interactive information systems made possible by the  computer technology, citizens can remain so well informed that they will be  able to perform their duty adequately and efficiently and accelerate the  process of development in different social fields.</p>
				<p align="justify">        Modern  communication systems reflect the philosophy and achievements of society in all  spheres by fast flow and pave the way for the homogeneity of culture-not only  with in its geographical unit but also beyond.<br />
                  Journalism is  the publication of news and views on various aspects of human activities in  newspapers and periodicals. Ina broader sense, the functions of journalism are  to convey national policies to the public and to keep the governments at local  state and central levels, informed of public needs. It also brings to the  notice of the government public reaction to government policies and decisions.  In addition, it keeps the public and the government informed of events and  happenings at home and abroad.<br />
                  On one hand,  it performs the utilitarian purpose of information and on the other, it  provides entertainment to its readers by publishing short stories, poems,  sports, cinema, features, etc. A clever journalism by his penmanship creates  interest in day-to-day political happenings. He presents the drop events and  incidents in an artistic way, which provides the reader information <br />
                  In modern times, the horizon of journalism has widened and it has  transcended the limits of mere reporting of political as well as  entertainment.and economic news. As it is a vehicle of mass-communications, it  is performing the function of social intercourse between the people having  identical interests. Hence, we find literary, political, economic and  scientific magazines as also household or industrial magazines, which cater to  the interests of their respective readers.<br />
  <strong>Principles  of modern journalism</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The main function of journalism  is to bring to light to the people what its members feel and think journalist  are therefore supposed to possess a good deal of intelligence, knowledge and  experience as well as natural and trained powers of observation and  reasoning.  A journalist has the same  obligations as a teacher or interpreter as an educationist has. A journalist  who misuses his power for any selfish or unworthy purpose is to a high trust.  While the freedom of the press needs to be guarded as a vital right of  humankind, it has to suffer certain explicit restrictions to subserve social  needs. Freedom of the press does not imply promotion of any private interest of  the journalist contrary to the general welfare. That is the way the so-called  news communications from sundry sources are not published by sensible  journalists without substantiating their value as news both in form and  substance.<br />
                  In  addition, partisanship in editorial comments, which is knowingly based on a  lie, does violence to the best spirit of journalism.<br />

                    <strong>1.News  function</strong><br />
                  The  primary function of press is to inform. Examining the glut of public  occurrences, ideas and situation, newspapermen must determine which will  interest the public. Apart from factual presentation of news, for the complex  situation the interpretation and explanation are also required.<br />
  <strong>2.  The opinion function</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Modern man frequently finds  himself in the midst of confusion which product to purchase? What decision to  take? Whom to vote? He requires a medium of communication, which will guide him  to understand the positive and negative points of the situations because of  logical arguments.  Thus, the modern  press has to be both a daily teacher and a daily tribute. Therefore, the  editorial is the only means of building public opinion.<br />
  <strong>3.  The Entertainment function</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Entertaining the public is the  another function and a business too. Since it is too big a job for the local  staff, newspaper rely upon syndicated materials. Entertainment is where you  find it. It pops up in human-interest stories and news features. Public  interest in various features, comics in particular sometimes determine the  choice of a newspaper.<br />

  <strong>            </strong> Our purpose in writing is to communicate  information. Therefore, our first consideration is our reader audience.
