				  1. Radio: A Popular Communication Medium<br />
  <strong>Historic  features</strong>:<br />
				  The  Madras Presidency Club pioneered ratio broadcasting in India in 1924.  The club worked a broadcasting service for three years, but owing to the  financial difficulties, gave it up in 1927. In the same year, some enterprising  businessmen in Bombay started the Indian  broadcasting Company with stations at Bombay and  Calcutta. This  company failed in 1930. In 1932 the government of India, took over the broadcasting.  A separate department of known as Indian Broadcasting service was opened. Later  it was designated as 'All India Radio' and was placed under a separate Ministry  - the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.<br />
				  Broadcasting  in India  is a national service, developed and operated by the Government of India. All  India Radio (also known as Akashvani) operates this service, over a network of  broadcasting stations located all over the country.Starting with six  broadcasting stations in 1947, the AIR today has a network of 195 broadcasting  stations and 183 full-fledged stations. These stations grouped into five zones,  are the following.<br />

  <strong>AIR's  programme pattern combines three main elements</strong></p>
				
			    <div align="justify">
				    <ul>
				      <li>a national channel providing programmes of  countrywide interest and significance.</li>
				      <li>a zonal service form each of the four  metropolitan centers (Delhi, Bombay,  Calcutta and  Chennai)</li>
				      <li>and regional services from individual stations  each catering to the needs and interests of its respective area.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
			    <p align="justify">            To enable AIR to reach all sections  of the Indian people, its programmes in the Home Service are broadcast in 20  principal languages. In addition, the External services of AIR beam their  programmes to listeners all over the world in 24 languages.<br />
				  AIR  now broadcasts a total of 239 new bulletins a day, with duration of 32 hours  and 17 minutes. Of these 67 are central bulletins broadcast from Delhi in 19  languages, with daily duration of 10 hours and 3 minutes; 57 external bulletin  (from Delhi) broadcasts in 24 languages for a duration of 7 hours 14 minutes  and 15 regional bulletins from 34 regional centers broadcast in 22 languages  and 34 tribal dialects with total duration of 15 hours every day.<br />
				  The  major source of news for AIR is its correspondents at home and abroad, the news  agencies and the monitoring services. AIR has a total of 206 correspondents. Of  these 111 are part time correspondents.</p>
				
			    <div align="justify">

			      </ul>
			    </div>
			    <p align="justify"><strong>2.  Television: A Powerful Communication Medium</strong><br />
				  Television  is one of the most powerful audio-visual media of mass communication, which  combines all the benefits of other mass media such as radio, newspaper and  film. It is an effective medium of dissemination and diffusion of information,  entertaining, educating and influencing the thought and attitude of rural  viewers. Television being an audio-visual medium, the message reaches to an  individual with the help of ears and eyes and hence gets a lasting impact. The  word television comes from Greek word meaning &quot;seen from a far&quot;. In  most of the developing countries, it is used as an instructional tool for  distance education, supplementing formal education, developing psychomotor  skills, adult education, and eradicating illiteracy. Television is used as a  medium of mass communication for dissemination of agro-information and  technical know-how to &quot;have-nots&quot;.<br />
  <strong>Historic  features</strong><br />
				  Television started as a modest affair in India on September 15, 1969 when All India Radio  set upon experimental Television service in Delhi. It was soon converted into full -  fledged telecasting station. Television set up was delinked from All India  Radio and under the name 'Doordarshan' given the status of full-fledged  Directorate with effect from April 1, 1976. Doordarshan has at present seven  Kendras located at Delhi, Bombay,  Chennai, Calcutta, Srinagar,  Amritsar and Lucknow  besides three base production centers at Delhi, Cuttack and Hyderabad.<br />
				  The  most momentous development in television in India is the Satellite  Instructional Television Experiment (SITE) which was inaugurated on August 1,  1975. It is the result of an agreement between India  and the United States  concluded in 1969. Under this agreement, ATS-6 satellite was made available to India for a  period of one year.  <br />
				  Following  the successful completion of the one year of Satellite Instructional Television  Experiment on July 31, 1976 it was decided to continue terrestrial programmes  for at least 40 per cent of the SITE villages. Terrestrial transmitters  were  set up at six locations. <em>viz</em>. Jaipur, Raipur,  Muzaffapur, Sambalpur, Hyderabad and Gulbarga.<br />
				  In  1984, a second channel was added to Delhi  to provide an alternative viewing options. 1993 marked the linking of four  terrestrial transmitters through satellite to provide DD - 2 Metro  Entertainment channel for urban audience .<br />
				  In  1997-98, Doordarshan reached 87% of the population and 70% of the area of the  country through a network of 897 terrestrial transmitters. It has production  studios at 42 cities. There are 53 other transmitters giving terrestrial  support to the other channels and Doordarshan uses a large no of transponders  on the Indian National Satellite(INSAT).<br />
				  Doodarshan's  primary viewership is of the order of 350 million. Doordarshan telecasts  programmes more than 1021 hours every week on its primary service. </p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Steps  in developing a television programme from topic to televised presentation:</strong><br />
				  The following method of developing a  television programme is not the only way, but offers briefly a logical  systematic procedure.<br />
				  Prepare your TV programme the way that is  easiest for you and yet gives you an effective television programme.</p>
				
			    <div align="justify">
				    <ol start="1" type="1">
				      <li>Select a subject matter field, which is, felt-need based from       rural audience point of view.</li>
				      <li>Choose a phase of that subject matter field. This may be called       topic. It may also need further limitation.</li>
				      <li>Determine the main point to be made in the programme. List all       the items that you will make to support this point.</li>
				      <li>Get a picture of the overall programme in your mind before you       proceed further.</li>
				      <li>Divide the programme into important steps, and list these steps       in logical order.</li>
				      <li>Consult resource material or a resource person if you need more       information or if you need to check the information for accuracy.</li>
				      <li>Select a format, or a method of presenting the television       programme. This may be a demonstration; an illustrated report; a dramatic       presentation; an interview; a forum or a variety formats; using several of       these methods combined. </li>
				      <li>Determine the need for other participants and contact possible       participants </li>
				      <li>Determine the audio and visual aids, equipment, materials and       properties that best show the points to be made. Make a list of all the       visuals.</li>
				      <li>Make an outline of the programme. Divide a sheet of paper into       two columns. In the left column, write the things you want to show, in the       right column put the things you want to say or talk about. Label the left       column 'Video' and the right column 'Audio'. Much of the audio column for       the demonstration type of programme and for the illustrated report will be       taken from the steps listed earlier in the planning (point 5). The visuals       will be fitted to this and will be indicated in the video column. The things       you want to show and the things you want to say about them should be       written opposite each other on the page.</li>
			      </ol>
			    </div>
			    <p align="justify">It is often necessary to  use a special device to get from one segment of the programme to another. This  is called a transition. It may be done visually, orally, or both. It ties the  whole programme together, giving it the polished, professional touch, and  results in a programme that flows smoothly. Transitions must be indicated in  the script if used.<br />
				  With  the opening and the closing of the programme including the action and talk that  will take place, put an attention getter in the opening and make the end  equally strong.</p>
				
			    <div align="justify">
				    <ol start="1" type="1">
				      <li>At the extreme left of the page indicate the amount of time in       minutes and seconds you think it will take to do each important step of       the programme.</li>
				      <li>Correct the outline script in view of the programme producer's       suggestions. Provide a copy of the script to programme producer, the       participants and others as needed. </li>
				      <li>If give-away material (a publication) is to be offered, check       to make sure that enough copies are available to meet the expected       requests.</li>
				      <li>Accumulate the audio aids; visual aids, materials properties       and equipment, and lay all out in the order each will be used. Check again       to make sure all of the visuals are at hand.</li>
				      <li>Rehearse the programme at home, office or some other convenient       place. Time the rehearsal for the total length and for each important       segment. Add or subtract material to fit the script into the desired time.       Rehearse the programme as it will be done at the station.</li>
				      <li>Arrive at the Doordarshan Kendra well ahead of telecast.       Acquaint the participants with the TV equipment and set, and introduce       them to the programme producer. Set up your equipment and rehearse the       programme without cameras. If time permits and facilities are available,       rehearse the programme with cameras.</li>
				      <li>Make any last-minute changes that are necessary and relax until       the programme is to be telecast.</li>
				      <li>While the programme is being 'telecast', concentrate on the       subject, not on the way you are or are not looking at the camera, moving       your hands, and the like. This should be taken care of in rehearsal.       Attempt to get an informal approach and to treat your audience as one       individual, not as a group of thousands.</li>
				      <li>Present the programme as it was outlined and as the programme       producer expects it. Trust the programme producer and the technical crew       to produce as good a show as they possibly can.</li>
				      <li>If something unexpected happens or you make a mistake, or drop       something, do not let it bother you. Recognize the mistake and continue       your programme as planned.</li>

				<p align="justify"><strong>Points to be remembered while  recording television programme:</strong>  </p>
				
			    <div align="justify">
				    <ol start="1" type="1">
				      <li>Facial expressions are very important. A smile on the face       makes a lot of difference. </li>
				      <li>Gestures should be used effectively in the communication       process.</li>
				      <li>Unnecessary movements should be avoided as these distract the       attention of the viewers. Check the habits of playing with a paperweight,       pen, chalk or scratching your head or cleaning your eyes or nose. Avoid       those movements also, which will express your nervousness.</li>
				      <li>Face the camera while talking to the viewers. Look into the       lens of the camera for having an eye to eye contact with the viewers. Eye       contact binds the attention of the viewers.  However, this does not mean that one should       continuously stare at the camera. Acknowledge the presence of the other       participants of the programme by looking at them from time to time.</li>
				      <li>Neat physical appearance is very important. Come to the       programme well dressed. </li>
				      <li>Visual aids, samples, models, working models, specimens etc.       make your programme interesting. Visual aids should be precise and drawn       with sharp colours. Graphic material, charts, slides, filmstrip etc.       should also be used to make the programme more interesting.</li>
				      <li>Pronunciation should be very clear and be audible. Proper speed       should be maintained while speaking. Proper word should be selected to       communicate the message. Avoid fad words and slangs, metaphors, phrases,       jargon and flowery language should not be used.</li>
				      <li>Do not have apologetic opening tone. Let your voice show       emotions. Do not sound weary and depressed. Let your voice have vitality,       vigor, energy and enthusiasm.</li>

				  Almost  every man longs for the power of speech. He knows that is one of the very few  tools for personal success. It is the only accomplishment which can gain him  quick and secure recognition. As an extension worker the power of speech, an  effective way of communicating ideas to the clientele system, is an  indispensable mechanism. The art of addressing the gathering provides him the  following benefits.</p>
				
			    <div align="justify">
				    <ul>
				      <li>Develop a capacity for human relations</li>

				      <li>It makes the mind methodical and ensure </li>
				      <li>Helps him to make decisions confidently</li>
				      <li>Participate in an organisation</li>
				      <li>Acquires qualities like enthusiasm, sincerity and  courage of one's conviction.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
			    <p align="justify">            As an Extension worker, we are more  concerned in the Transfer of Technology. In other words, we have to communicate  effectively to the audience, to ensure the fullest adoption f the latest  technology.
