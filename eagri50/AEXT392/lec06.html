				<p>SMALL GROUP TECHNIQUES<br />
            Small  group techniques are the means or methods used ingroup situation to bring about  group act.  There are time-tested  techniques like lecture, debate, forum, dialogue, symposium, brain storming,  etc through which group actions may be accomplished.<br />
 <strong>I. Lecture</strong><br />
            It  is normally used in formal situations. It requires thorough preparation on the  part of the person who delivers the lecture.<br />
<strong>Dynamic  characteristics of lecture method:</strong></p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>As an extremely formal technique, the lecture permits only       one-way communication.</li>
				  <li>It allows for complete and detailed communication without any       interruptions.</li>
				  <li>It is a very rapid method of conveying information to a group.</li>
				  <li>Control of audience is rigid since it is entirely in the hands       of the speaker.</li>
				  <li>It is an abstract form of group interaction and hence calls for       a high degree of competence from speakers and high level of audience       co-operation.</li>
				  <li>Group members and leaders can put little control over content       and approach.</li>
				  <li>It is difficult to measure the effect of speech on the group in       an objective way.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Purposes:</strong></p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>To present information in a formal and direct manner.</li>
				  <li>To supply expert information on a particular topic.</li>
				  <li>To identify the problems / problem areas in a given situation.</li>
				  <li>To explore the facts of the problem.</li>
				  <li>To explore one or several solutions to a problem</li>
				  <li>To have additional reading.</li>
				  <li>To inspire the group.</li>
				  <li>To direct/entertain the group by using skilled/experienced       people</li>
				  <li>To share the experience of another person.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>How  to use this method:</strong></p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Have clearly in mind the objectives of the meeting and prepare       the lecture accordingly.</li>
				  <li>Consider the other alternative means that may be used to       accomplish the objective. It also depends on audience nature.</li>
				  <li>Provide a situation in which group members are physically       comfortable.</li>
				  <li>Inform the speaker of the topic and make him to feel at ease in       the speaking situation.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>How  to organise subject matter:</strong></p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li><strong>Chronological       arrangement - </strong>Introductory lectures, are amenable for this type of       arrangement. </li>
				  <li><strong>Logical arrangement -</strong> Step by step approach. The abstract subject may consist concepts and       principles. The lecturer should process the information from simple ideas       to complex ones. </li>
				  <li><strong>Structural arrangement -</strong> The lecturer may start either from lower unit or higher unit in the       approved hierarchy.  </li>
				  <li><strong>Arrangement according to       importance: </strong>This is called psychological approach. The information may       be presented by arranging the points according to their importance.</li>
				  <li><strong>Arrangement according to       contrast: </strong>Contrasting facts can be an effective way of learning and it       leaves a strong impression about the good effects of a particular       information.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>How a lecture should be delivered:</p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Don’t write the entire lecture and read out the contents.</li>
				  <li>Look at your audience from time to time to get a personal       approach.</li>
				  <li>Don't follow a rigid type of lecture.</li>
				  <li>Avoid nervous type of lecturing.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Cautions:</strong></p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Do not overuse this method.</li>
				  <li>The lecture is inferior to symposium for bringing out the       divergent views up on the subject.</li>
				  <li>It is not so effective in moving a group towards consensus or       action.</li>
				  <li>It is inferior to panel discussion in order to bring about a       resolution of differences of opinion among groups.</li>
				  <li>It is inferior to role play in getting group members to get the       point of view of others in a controversial situation.</li>
				  <li>The major defect is that it is the easiest way out for the       speaker who has formal responsibility for group meeting.</li>
				  <li>The technique demands high level of competence on the part of       speakers.</li>
				  <li>The group should be a responsive one and should have urge to       learn from the lecture</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>II.  Dialogue</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Dialogue is a discussion carried  on in front of a group by two knowledgeable persons capable of thoughtful  communicative discourse on specific subjects.<br />
				  It  is less formal than lecture or panel discussion and has many unique dynamics or  advantages of its own.<br />
  <strong>Dynamic  characteristics of dialogue:</strong></p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>It can be very informal and conversational.</li>
				  <li>It allows direct and easy communication of information and       points of view.</li>
				  <li>It allows for mutual support and sharing of responsibility       between two persons.</li>
				  <li>It allows for interpersonal stimulation.</li>
				  <li>It aids unskilled speakers in presenting their ideas.</li>
				  <li>It usually create great interest among other persons in the       group.</li>
				  <li>It is simple in form and easy to plan and carry out.</li>
				  <li>It allows for clarification, logic validation and consistency       as the discussion develops and permits expression of two points of views.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Purposes:  This method may be chosen -</strong></p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>To present facts, opinions, views in an informal conversational       manner.</li>
				  <li>To create interest in a subject.</li>
				  <li>To focus attention on an issue or problem.</li>
				  <li>To explore in detail different points of view or obtain       agreement on different points of view.</li>
				  <li>To create a desire and motivation for reflective thinking.</li>
				  <li>To rapidly set a frame works for thought and discussion and       give basic facts preparatory to general group discussion.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>How  to use this method:</strong></p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Select a timely and significant topic with which at least two       group members are familiar.</li>
			    </ol>
				<ol>
				  <li>Select dialogue team members. They should be able to  work in team, share leadership, guide conversation, interact, summarise and  provide needed transition.</li>
			    </ol>
				<ol start="3" type="1">
                  <li>Decide on the person to introduce the dialogue and to take       responsibility for answering questions after the dialogue and to lead the       discussion.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Responsibilities  of the participants in a dialogue:</strong><br />
				  The participants should </p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Arrange a meeting before the presentation at which an agreement       should be reached on </li>
				  <li>The frame work for discussion</li>
				  <li>How the subject will be introduced and how the framework for       discussion is set.</li>
				  <li>Tentative timing for major points</li>
				  <li>Responsibilities for summarising and integrating the points.</li>
				  <li>Arrange the physical setting so that all members can see, hear       and feel the dialogue situation.</li>
				  <li>Fulfill the designated roles objectively and without over       emotional involvement</li>
				  <li>Assist the chairman in clarifying questions and summarisation.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>Cautions:</p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>The topic should be one in which the group is interested.</li>
				  <li>Keep the discussion at a level that can be understood by the       group.</li>
				  <li>Do not develop the discussion too rapidly.</li>
				  <li>Avoid making speeches; and reading written materials.</li>
				  <li>Share the responsibility; if not the dialogue may end up as       interview  or a series of lengthy       speeches.</li>
				  <li>Although the major interaction is between the dialogue       participants, they should not get so enamoured with each other and their       ideas that they may forget they must communicate to the other group       members.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>III.  Symposium</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Symposium is a group of talks,  speeches or lectures presented by several individuals on various phases of a  single subject problem. The identified problem must have effective components  amenable for the sessions.<br />
				  A  moderator often controls time and subject matter. Properly used, the talk  should not exceed 20 minutes and the total time should not exceed one hour. In  a symposium, the audience may or may not participate.<br />
  <strong>Dynamic  characteristics of symposium:</strong></p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Symposium is relatively a formal method and comparatively easy       to organise.</li>
				  <li>It allows for systematic and relatively complete expression of       ideas in an uninterrupted fashion.</li>
				  <li>Complex subject problems may readily be divided into logical       component parts.</li>
				  <li>Structuring of presentation is obtained by pre-symposium       agreement among participants.</li>
				  <li>There should be a minimum of duplication and time allotment       should lead to precise and logical presentation</li>
				  <li>Control of subject and time can be done by pre-agreement </li>
				  <li>There is a minimum interaction between the participants.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Purposes: </strong> This method may be chosen </p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>To present basic information i.e., facts or points of view of a       particular subject problem</li>
				  <li>To present a relatively complete and systematic expression of       ideas without interruption.</li>
				  <li>To bring together and focus different points of view within a       logical, more generalised framework or content.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Symposium has a moderator/chairman </strong><br />
                    <strong>Duties  of Moderator / Chairman: -</strong></p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>He should meet the symposium speakers well before the meeting       and secure agreement on logical arrangement </li>
				  <li>Outline the areas to be covered and get an agreement on       sequence and time allowances</li>
				  <li>He should meet them immediately before the meeting to review       the above points</li>
				  <li>At the meeting, he should give the general setting of the       problem and point out its significance, describe the sequence of each       speaker and set out the atmosphere for listening and thinking by the       group.</li>
				  <li>Inform the group of the procedure to be followed including the       role of speakers and role of the group during and after the symposium.</li>
				  <li>Introduce each speaker in detail as his turn comes and       establish the qualification of speakers to speak on the subject. This       makes an impression over the audience.</li>
				  <li>Perform additional functions depending on what procedure has       been set up to follow including summarising or follow up techniques such       as</li>
			    </ol>
				<ol>
				  <ol>
				    <li>Give each speaker a specific time for a short statement  of clarification</li>
				    <li>Allow each speaker to ask a few questions of any of the  other speakers.</li>
				    <li>Involve the audience in direct questioning from the  floor.</li>
			      </ol>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Duties  of speakers:</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>They should attend the “planning meetings” organized by  the moderator.</li>
				  <li>They should prepare concise well organised  presentations that can be given within the time allotted.</li>
				  <li>Present the prepared material clearly and concisely in  the allotted time.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Cautions:</strong></p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Care must be taken in choosing the subject and breaking it into       meaningful and manageable component parts.</li>
				  <li>Careful selection is important in naming the moderator and the       speakers.</li>
				  <li>Unbiased members who can approach the subject logically and       present it without over emotional involvement should be selected.</li>
				  <li>The moderator is just not a speech maker but interpreter of       speeches in the right time. He should be able to treat it properly.</li>
				  <li>In planning, limit the time of speeches and set a method for       enforcing the time limitations.</li>
				  <li>While logical, precise presentations are the key to good       symposium, the intent of the larger group must be stimulated and       maintained if the symposium is to fulfill it objective.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>IV.  Debate</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Debate is a series of lectures  for and against on a given topic by knowledgeable persons. The normal pattern  is to have two teams on affirmative and negative side of the issue. The number  of persons on both the sides should be equal. Each team will have a leader  supported by his team members and there will be a chair or moderator who  presides over the discussion.<br />
                    <strong>Dynamic  characteristics of Debate:</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>It can be easily organised at short notice.</li>
				  <li>It helps to attract the attention of audience and hold  it to the end.</li>
				  <li>Topics with reference to felt needs may be identified  so as to enthuse the audience throughout the debate.</li>
				  <li>Audience are instigated to think seriously and analyse  by the proceedings of the debate.</li>
				  <li>The range of the topic as well as the time can be  prefixed on agreement.</li>
				  <li>It enables the participants to have a complete and  unreserved expression of their ideas.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Purposes: </strong>This method is useful when</p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Topics of controversial nature are dealt with.</li>
				  <li>Formality of presentation is not an impediment to the group’s       listening and understanding.</li>
				  <li>When the group needs to be exposed to the pros and cons of the       topic or decision.</li>
				  <li>When the participants have the capacity to present their side       in a meaningful and interesting manner.</li>
				  <li>When there is a necessity to communicate different points of       view in a larger group where total involvement is not possible.</li>
				  <li>Group members have only low level participation so as to       stimulate their thought and action.</li>
				  <li>There is favourable atmosphere in the group to accept ideas       presented by logical arguments of the participants.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Duties  of the Moderator / Chairman:</strong></p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>The chairman should meet the participants and get the sequence       of appearance and time allowances.</li>
				  <li>Inform the group of the procedure to be followed including the       role of the participants and the group.</li>
				  <li>The chairman should introduce the leaders and participants to       establish their competence on the topic identified.</li>
				  <li>After the delivery of speech by each participant, the chairman       should give a summary drawing the attention of people on salient features       covered. </li>
				  <li>Chairman should throw a friendly challenge to the next speaker       to disprove the previous speaker’s points thereby increasing the anxiety       of group to listen more carefully over the issues to be covered.</li>
				  <li>He should make arrangements by intimating the time prescribed       for each participant without exceeding the limit.</li>
				  <li>The chairman should deliver an unbiased judgment, which should       be logically acceptable, however, appreciating the laudable points of the       conquered side also.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Tips  for preparation of a good Debate:</strong></p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>A good and interesting introduction. It may start with a story,       good joke, a striking statement or citation, strong questions, etc       relevant to the topic. </li>
				  <li>Give live examples to make the speech interesting  </li>
				  <li>Include the details which are specific, familiar, unusual,       humorous and controversial so that the debate is charged with vitality.</li>
				  <li>Initiate efforts to refer to the negative sides of the previous       speaker and assist your points of view with reliable facts and examples.</li>
				  <li>Be sincere, courageous and express your views on support of       your side without hesitation in a strong and persuasive manner</li>
				  <li>End up with impressive conclusion made up of the formal summary       and a direct appeal to look the audience to your side within the allotted       time.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Cautions:</strong></p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>The range of subject should not be out of the purview of and       interest of the group.</li>
				  <li>Emotional debate may become highly antagonistic and lead to       conflict between groups.</li>
				  <li>Motive to win a debate may lead to distortion of information       leading to ignoring the primary need of the audience.</li>
				  <li>It is useful only under certain purposes and under certain       conditions.</li>
				  <li>The moderator and participants should be knowledgeable and       should not be over enthusiastic and carried away by emotions.<strong></strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>V.  Panel discussion</strong><br />
				  A group of speaker’s  usually 2-8 participants as panelist in a supposedly informal conversation on a  topic for the benefit of listeners constitute the panel discussion.<br />
				  It  may be described as an informal committee discussion overheard by an audience.  The form of discussion is conversational (i.e.) no speeches by members or by  moderator should be permitted. A leader as a moderator or chairman introduces  the speakers to the audience and encourages less talkative by administering  effective questions.<br />
  <strong>Types  of panel discussion:</strong><br />
  <strong>i)  Chairman - member panel: </strong><br />
				  This  is also otherwise called Question - Answer panel. The presentation of the panel  is actually a series of questions by the chairman and answers by the members of  the panel.<br />
  <strong>ii)  Set - speech panel</strong><br />
				  This  is the pre-arranged panel. After the chairman introduces the topic, each one  makes a prepared speech. When the last member made the speech, the panel is  turned into a forum.<br />
  <strong>iii)  Conversational Panel</strong><br />
				  After  the members are introduced and topics communicated, the panel members hold a  conversation on the topic with the questions and comments going from one member  to another. From time to time, the chairman may throw out the questions or  remarks to help the conversation.<br />
  <strong>Dynamic  characteristics:</strong></p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>The atmosphere of the panel discussion may be informal or at       times formal also.</li>
				  <li>It can expose and focus on different points of view, facts,       attitudes and a subject problem.</li>
				  <li>It allows for maximum interaction and inter-stimulation between       panel members.</li>
				  <li>It often increases the interest of the audience with the       specific subject because of active and dramatic presentation of subject       matter.</li>
				  <li>It is a useful method of defining points of agreement, areas of       disagreement and of approaching consensus. </li>
				  <li>It divides responsibility among the panel members by arranging       prior meetings</li>
			    </ol>
				<h1>Purposes: This method might be  chosen </h1>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>To increase an informal atmosphere for communication in the       group</li>
				  <li>To identify the problems and issues to be considered and to explore       them</li>
				  <li>To give the audience an understanding of the component parts of       the problem</li>
				  <li>To get different facts and points of view brought into a       discussion framework</li>
				  <li>To weight the advantages and disadvantages of the course of       action</li>
				  <li>To motivate the larger group for the constructive thought and       the action</li>
				  <li>To determine the areas of agreement and discuss the issue -       bases and strive for consensus</li>
				  <li>To force a group for enabling them to join in the problem-       sowing process</li>
			    </ol>

				  <li>The chairman should open the discussion with a relevant       statement that will immediately focus the attention of the audience.</li>
				  <li>The chairman should ask the reflective thought provoking       questions.</li>
				  <li>The chairman should probe for points of disagreement for       leading the discussion.</li>
				  <li>The Chairman should present an effective summary that may lead       for action.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>b.  Panel members</strong></p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>The panel members should prepare material and organise thoughts       so cogently </li>
				  <li>The panel member should set an example of careful, reflective       and rational thinking.</li>
				  <li>They should listen thoughtfully to the comments of other       members and strive to get new points. </li>
				  <li>The panel members should watch for a right moment or occasion       to present his/her view points.</li>
				  <li>The panel members should keep the atmosphere informal and       conversational.</li>
				  <li>The panel members should contribute to the discussion by       respecting other's views.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>c.  Group members</strong></p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>The group should have clear in mind the objectives of the       meeting</li>
				  <li>The group should make sure that the topic selected be timely       and significant.</li>
				  <li>The group can also play an effective role by selecting the       chairman moderator who is unbiased, who can think rapidly and who effect       reflective questions and finally summarise well.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Cautions</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>The success of this technique depends on the moderator  and the panel members.</li>
				  <li>The discussion must not be monopolised and by one or  two members.</li>
				  <li>The planning is an absolute necessity for the  successful performance of this technique.</li>
				  <li>Allow enough time. Panels shorter than 30 minutes may  not be a successful one.</li>
				  <li>The panel discussion should be concluded while the  general interest of the group is high.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>VI.  Role play</strong><br />
				  Learner  involvement is a critical factor in successful teaching. People learn more  effectively not by being taught in conventional way but a in participating  mode. Role-play encourages active involvement of learners. It combines  effective learning with an enjoyable experience.<br />
  <strong>Basic  descriptions</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Participants act out a situation involving human  interaction </li>
				  <li>Participants act freely rather than from a script.</li>
				  <li>There will be observers who do not portray any roles.</li>
				  <li>Feedback is provided through follow - up discussion.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Steps  in conducting role play</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Prepare  the class/settings for the experience by familiarising them with a problem  situation they can relate to.</li>
				  <li>Discuss  the situation and help the class to see the nature of the problem.</li>
				  <li>Orient the class on role playing technique and define  their roles.</li>
				  <li>Request for voluntary participation and select persons  for the roles.</li>
				  <li>Give the participants a short preparation time.</li>
				  <li>Prepare the observers to the subject area, nature of  problem/issue and the current happenings.</li>
				  <li>Execute the role play in the identified place </li>
				  <li>Conduct a follow up discussion involving both  participants and observers.</li>
				  <li>Repeat the role-play if class is still interesting.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Outcomes  of role-play</strong></p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>It provides opportunity to examine various roles in situations       that speaks of reality </li>
				  <li>It gives insight into the roles a person who plays in real life       and how effectively one play those roles.</li>
				  <li>It illustrates principles related to the subject matter.</li>
				  <li>It expands participants empathy</li>
				  <li>It demonstrates in advance how students trainees would probably       react under some real situations.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>VII.  Brainstorming</strong><br />
				  Brainstorming  is a specialised form of discussion method that can be used in a training  situation. It is potentially an active teaching mode but its efficiency depends  on what we do and skill of the participants in arranging and conducting it.  Brainstorming refers to the rapid generation of ideas, initially not critical  and evaluated about a topic or concern in a given period. The poured in  information is later sorted, synthesised and discussed. It helps to identify  problems.<br />
				  Many  trainers believe that brainstorming means a random and unstructured way of  generating ideas and solutions. This is far from the truth. Brainstorming is  certainly not a straightforward method of decision - making or problem solving.  At the heart of this method is the principle that as ideas or solutions are  proposed, comments and evaluation are suspended until the time this step is  completed and the group is ready to move on to the next step of analysis. It is  also based on the premise that it is not good to shoot down an idea or proposal  without properly considering its merits and demerits in an unbiased manner.  Another posit on which this method is based is the principle of synergy. It is  possible to generate more ideas collectively than the sum of the ideas that  would be produced individually<br />
  <strong>i)  Objectives of the method</strong><br />
				  In the context of a training programme,  this method may have any of the following objectives:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Generating a wide range of solutions or options in  solving a problem, addressing an issue/situation or in taking a decision, thus  stimulating creativity in the group.</li>
				  <li>Developing a positive attitude among the participants  by encouraging them to listen carefully to others, suspend judgement and  outright rejection of their ideas, and refrain from negative comments without  going into their merits and demerits.</li>
				  <li>Encouraging shy and reluctant participants to share  their ideas and views without the fear of getting an immediate negative  reaction from other colleagues. The members can become open about their  thoughts and viewpoints.</li>
				  <li>Promoting attitudes that will help the participants  work more effectively ingroups.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>ii)  Steps in Organising a Brainstorming Session</strong><br />
				  Learning  in this exercise occurs because participants discipline their inputs to the  discussion. Control occurs through instructions and through the discussion  leader. The following are the steps in organising the session:<br />
  <strong>a)  Generation of ideas</strong><br />
				  The  starting point is to generate a large number of ideas within a short span of  time. Thus, there is a comparatively greater emphasis on quantity and  encouraging members to think and be creative in generating new ideas, proposals  or options. Quality or merit is assessed later lest it should inhibit or even  stifle the process of generation of ideas. It is the task of the discussion leader  to ensure that this basic principle is not violated. No discussion should be  permitted, except to clarify a thought or statement. It is likely that some of  the ideas put forward by the members may be totally outlandish. However,  sometimes a sound solution may emerge from proposals that, at the outset, may  appear to be impractical or inappropriate. These ideas may be further worked  upon by the group and refined to make them more relevant, in line with the  criteria set out by the group and acceptable to it.<br />
  <strong>b)  Amending ideas</strong><br />
				  The  discussion leader can intervene if the ideas expressed need to be amended  through elaboration, editing or consolidation. He / She also has the task to  assist those who are not in a position to appropriately articulate their views.  If certain ideas are repeated, the discussion leader can bring this to the  attention of the participant and ask for another option. The leader should,  however, avoid any analysis at this stage. The leader should also ensure that  ideas expressed earlier should not be opposed or repudiated.<br />
  <strong>c)  Posting all the ideas on a Flip chart</strong><br />
				  It  will be helpful to post all the ideas generated through this exercise on a flip  chart. This will reinforce the contributions of those that have contributed  earlier and serve as a point of reference and an encouragement for those who  follow.<br />
  <strong>d)  Analysing ideas</strong><br />
				  Once  all the ideas are posted, the discussion leader should proceed to analyse them,  going in chronological order. It is necessary that until this step, the  discussion leader should make it clear that judgement is suspended and the  merits and demerits are not expressed. The analysis takes place in light of the  objectives of the exercise and the criteria set by the group. All factors,  which could have any bearing on the final decision of the group, should be duly  considered.<br />
  <strong>e)  Action Planning</strong><br />
				  The  group is now ready to plan action on the basis of the decision arrived at  through consensus and at this stage it outlines steps to implement the  decision.</p>
