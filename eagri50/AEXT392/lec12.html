                  <strong>TRAINING FOR DEVELOPMENT</strong><br />
            Training has  become an inseparable part of HRD. It has become one of the components, which  enables any institution to churn out its employees as the most productive and  most suitable ones.<br />
<strong>Training – Definitions</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Training  is the art of increasing the knowledge and skill of an    employee for doing a particular job.  </li>
				  <li>Training  is a learning process, which seeks a relatively permanent change in behavior  that occurs as a result of experience.</li>
				  <li>Training  is the process of aiding employees to gain effectiveness           in their present or future work  through the development of           appropriate  habits of thought, action, skills, knowledge and attitude (Milton Mall, 1980).</li>
				  <li>Training  is the process of changing employee behaviour, attitudes,         or opinion through some type of guided  experience (Krietner, 1989).</li>
				  <li>Training  is a systematic process of changing the behavior,          knowledge and or motivation of present employees to improve  the             match between employee  characteristic and employment requirement (Milkovich and Boudreau, 1998)</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Need for training</strong> <br />
				  The process of  training has caught up mainly in industries. This can be attributed to the  sudden and competitive change that is occurring in the world. However, the  needs for training can be fixed down to the following:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Rapid  changes in technologies and jobs people do.</li>
				  <li>Immediate  and long term skill shortage</li>
				  <li>Changes  in the expectation and composition of work force</li>
				  <li>Competition  and market pressure for improvement in quality of products and services.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Training Process</strong><br />
				  In case of  training, the focus will be on a person-on-the job-in the organization. Whereas  in the case of training process, the focus will be both at the starting point  and at the end with difference. The application of what a person has learned  during training process is called the effectiveness of training.<br />
				  The training process has three phases as follows:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Pre-training</li>
				  <li>Training</li>
				  <li>Post-training</li>
				  <li><strong>Pre-training phase</strong></li>
				  <li>Pre-training process starts with understanding  the situation, which calls for behavior that is more effective.</li>
				  <li>Key aspect of the process is analysis of  situation and job on which improved performance is to be achieved.</li>
				  <li>Pre-training begins with description of  the job to be changed by it.</li>
				  <li>The technical requirement of the job is  not enough but also knowledge on operational description of the job is required  so that the training programme can be designed to meet out those requirements.</li>
				  <li>The second aspect is the organization's  receptivity to more effective behaviour of the trained people. How far the  organization would respond to the change in knowledge and skill of the trainee  after he returns from training is also to be considered.</li>
				  <li>Who feels the need for this new behaviour?  Is it his immediate superior of the organization itself or the trainee himself  has to be taken into account for an effective training programme.</li>
				  <li><strong>Training phase</strong></li>
				  <li>Most  of the training programmes would be for a session or an evening course or a  residential program.</li>
				  <li>In  the training program, the trainee is exposed to a new subject matter, new  people, new atmosphere and the participant would be at unease for a while,  later when the subject which would be useful and  stimulating is taught the participant would  focus his attention on the subject of his interest and would be in line with  other participants.</li>
				  <li>There  would be several questions in his mind, such that he is lacking, the skill  required for his job or is it an opportunity given for his sincere work in the  organization or is it a plan of the organization to keep him away from the  organization so that it would implement the programme which he had strongly  opposed.</li>
				  <li>With  all such questions in his mind, there will be no guarantee that the trainee  will learn what he has chosen to learn. His mind would deviate and he would  learn something of his interest from the training program provided. This error  in selection would be due to the lack of necessary capabilities of the trainee  or irrelevant training design and methodology followed by that training  institution etc.,</li>
				  <li>Finally  after overcoming all the hurdles in the initial stage of training programme,  the participant would explore in training situation what interests him the  more. After exploring, if he finds it useful he tries it again and checks for  its effectiveness and satisfaction. There would be several trials repeatedly.</li>
				  <li>If  he is satisfied with the results, he decides to incorporate it in his  organization, but if he finds it to be not useful he discards it and tries some  other variant, in some cases he may discontinue his learning.</li>
				  <li><strong>Post-training phase</strong></li>
				  <li>Here the situation changes, the  participant goes back to his work place, meets his colleagues, family members  etc. He goes prepared with some anticipations, as he had been away from them for  a while and also had come back learning some new ideas.</li>
				  <li>Newly learned skills undergo modifications  to fit in with the work situation. If the organization were encouraging and  helping, the participant would use his training for the betterment of his organization.  Some organization would offer support to the participants to have contact with  the training institution even after the training program.</li>
				  <li>On the other hand, if the organization  resented his absence and if his table is loaded with work, he would feel extra  burden and would work to make up for lost time. He would loose his interest to  make use of his training and the contact with the training institution is also  broken off.<strong></strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Training process – models</strong><br />
				  There are several  models for training processes, of which there are three important models.<br />
				  1.Simple model of training process<br />
				  2.Elaborated model of training process<br />
				  3.Spiral model of training process<br />
  <strong>Training Strategy</strong><br />
				  Effective  training calls, in the first place, for clarity of objectives and means. In  that respect it is just like a manufacturing process, both the ends and means  must be appropriate to the purpose. Relating them demands clear specifications  for each part of the training task, including the resources of time, skill, and  facilities required for it. Ensuring this is a responsibility of the first  order. <br />
				  It is necessary to consider four strategic  questions, which shall be examined in turn. The first and second are of  external strategies,</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Establishing  training goals</li>
				  <li>Defining  training specifications</li>
				  <li>The  next two are outcomes of internal strategy</li>
				  <li>Organizing  the training inputs and</li>
				  <li>Improving  the training institution</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>I. External strategy</strong><br />
				  External strategy  is concerned with two kinds of questions. The first is what are the training  goals, that is, the changes to be effected? The second is, that are the number  and kinds of people who therefore need to be trained and resources of time,  skill and facilities required for this particular training.</p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Establishing  training goals</strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>            Training institutions don't set any  goal. They set tasks to work on goals which training can help to reach. Two  strategic questions are asked in establishing training goals. 1. Are the goals  realistic? and  2. Is the training input  envisaged in the development - also realistic? There are two steps before  setting up the training course. 1. After a change is decided, is training that  much necessary? and 2. Defining the part that training can play in change.<br />
                    <strong>DESIGNING EXTENSION TRAINING PROGRAMMES</strong><br />
				  While a training plan provides a  structure for training, the design of a training programme provides its  content. A training plan provides broad parameters within which training is  required to take place in accordance with the assessed training needs of  extension personnel within the frame work of extension training policy. The  design of the training programme operationalises the training plan and provides  actual training. A well designed training programme will go a long way in  ensuring success of training intervention. As a corollary, an ill-designed  training programme is deemed to be a failure. The following are the steps in  designing a training programme:<br />
  <strong>A. Objectives of training programmes</strong><br />
				  The first step in the design of a  training programme is a clear statement of the objectives of the training  programme. These objectives have to be based on the Training Needs Assessment  (TNA) of extension personnel and stated, in order of priority, from general to  specific objectives. These objectives have to be stated in terms of knowledge,  Skills, Attitudes and Attributes, which the trainee will gain at the end of the  training programme.<br />
				  A clear enunciation of objectives of  training programme will enable the trainees to have a clear idea as to what  should they expect from training.<br />
				  At a simple level of treatment the  objectives of a training programme fall under two categories, namely, General  behavioural objectives, and Specific Behavioural objectives. Both types of  objectives are required to be stated in the objectives of a training programme. <br />
				  At a more sophisticated level of  treatment, following the Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives, the  training objectives can be classified into three classes of Cognitive  Objectives, Psycho-Motor Objectives, and Affective Objectives, and their  sub-classess.<br />
				  If the design of a training  programme is conceptualised to consist of (a) objectives, (b) learning  experience and (c) evaluation, then the objectives provide the base upon which  subsequent edifice of  learning  experience and evaluation could be built and hence their importance in the  design of a training programme.<br />
  <strong>B. Skill - Mix</strong><br />
				  The second step in the design of  training programme is determination of appropriate skill-mix for different  levels of extension personnel.<br />
  <strong>Katz </strong>postulate three types of skills for  a manager, namely (i) Technical Skills, (ii) Human Skills, and (iii) Conceptual  Skills as proposed by Misra (1990) .<br />
  <strong>Fig.36. Skill mixes for the  different levels of Extension Personnel</strong><br />
  <br clear="all" />
  <strong>Source: Misra, D.C. (1990), New Dimension in Extension Training</strong></p>
				<p>            For example, field-level personnel  like Village Level Extension workers and Agricultural Extension Officers  require technical skills in ample measure, human skills in fairly good measure  and conceptual skills in moderate measure.<br />
                    <strong>C. Curriculum Development</strong><br />
				  The next step in the design of a  training programme is development of appropriate training curriculum.  Curriculum is required to be developed   for two reasons. Specific curriculum is required to be developed for a  specific training course which is organised in response to assessed training  needs of extension personnel which emerges out of the changing needs of  farmers. Since no ready made curriculum exists for the purpose, specific  curriculum is required to be developed for a specific training course which has  a specific target group. Its challenge lies in the fact that it is  interdisciplinary.Curriculum development is required to anticipate future  needs.<br />
  <strong>Components of a Standard Curriculum</strong><br />
				  Course  objectives<br />
				  Achievement  Targets<br />
				  Course  Structure<br />
				  Assessment<br />
				  Course  Contents  <br />
				  <br />
  <strong>CONDUCTING AN ACTIVE TRAINING  PROGRAMME</strong><br />
				  A training program can be totally  successful only if effective exercises have been worked out previously.  Attention should be paid on the physical setup, rapport building and content of  the program. Programs that look gorgeous on paper are worthless if the trainer  doesn't have delivery skills to carryout the design requirements.</p>
				<p><strong>Steps to conduct an active training  programme :</strong><br />
                    <strong>1.Preparing yourself mentally</strong><br />
				  Feeling  comfort  with the course content <br />
				  Thorough  preparation well in advance<br />
				  Preparation  of material activities for training program<br />
				  Course  materials, manuals, rooms, audio visual equipments etc. and get connected with  the participants<br />
				  If  a question is asked and you do not know the answer give it as a group exercise;  another way is to write them down and promise to find the answer.<br />
				  Repeating  a course may be a bored one to the trainer but not to a new trainee - Focus  your attention on the participants and not on oneself and make opportunities to  learn from their experience through discussions.</p>
				<p><strong>2) Arranging the physical  environment</strong><br />
				  The  physical set up at first the participants receive will create permanent  impressions of the program.<br />
				  The  seating arrangements should depend on many factors like number of participants,  method of speech, and the like.<br />
				  In  case the program has little of writing work, the participants can get rid of  tables and they can arrange the chairs to their comfort.<br />
				  In  other case, if small subgroups should be formed, care should be taken to leave  enough space so that one group does not disturb another group.          <br />
				  A  well-known arrangement is horseshoe type. This can be modified into a square or  a circle. All these arrangements favour group discussions with face to face  contact with each participant.<br />
				  These  arrangements can be formed with the help of the participants themselves for  their own comfort.</p>
				<p><strong>3) Greeting participants and  establishing program</strong><br />
				  The best and most desired start is a  good welcome address. The trainer should be able to reach the mind of each  person, make each feel good in the new situation, allow his feelings to flow  without any hesitation. Hence a trainer should ensure that his program should  have a good greet and hence to build rapport with the participants.<br />
				  A short refreshment before the  actual training enables participants to mix well among themselves. Trainer  himself can build relationship by knowing their names and making them feel  comfortable. During the opening session he/she should introduce the  participants to each of them and he himself should be introduced with a touch  of  un boastful higher knowledge.<br />
				  There are number of wordings which  can be addressed. To mention a few 'I have got something for you'<br />
				  This should make a feeling among the  participants that they have a person with much greater knowledge and experience  to his credit.<br />
				  &quot;I've been through this  too&quot;<br />
				  This makes a 'we' feeling among the  participants and the trainer. The participants feel that the trainer can  understand one's problems and this workload so this helps to bring out their  own experience in this field.<br />
				  &quot;I admire you&quot;<br />
				  This greeting puts the participants  on a higher stand. This is the way one can express one’s admiration over the  participant's qualities and deed. It may be on very simple actions of theirs  but such an admiration heartens the people to a much higher extent.<br />
  <strong>4. Getting the best from the first  30 minutes of trainers</strong><br />
				  The first 30 minutes of any  classroom period is the most crucial period which a trainer should not trample  upon. It is called the 'grave period' according to Napien and Gershenfeld  (1983) during which any over hostility or antagonism will be submerged under a  veneer of politeness, watchfulness and reserve. It is during this time that the  participants perceive  what role they  expect to play during the training program, what they intent to accomplish  during the course.<br />
				  Begin the class at the time intended  without creating impatience among the participants, once competence should be  made known to the members. One should make himself compatible with the group  and create trust. The trainee should be clear on what activities are there for  the participants and how and when they can get connected to their home town.<br />
  <strong>5. Reviewing the agenda</strong><br />
				  In the beginning moments of the  program, one should be made clear of what is going to be done i.e.,  What is expected of the programme and What is  expected of the participants. The training objectives should be given in  writing and these should be explained clearly. The list of what is to be accomplished  should also be presented. They should be informed of how the program will be  done with indications of the stay place, food arrangements, telephone messages  etc. A content outline and a description of the activities designed should also  be given.<br />
  <strong>6. Inviting feedback</strong><br />
				  After reviewing the agenda, one must  not fail to get the feedback on the agenda. This gives the participants an  opportunity to give their views or to tell what they expect more of the  programs. The simplest approach is to ask directly &quot;Does this m match what  you hope to gain from this program?&quot;. &quot;Is  there anything you would like to add to  it?&quot;.<br />
				  The feedback helps the trainer to  change his program if feasible to the requirements of the participants and  remains compatible with them. Otherwise, the programme will be a waste with a  content not interested to the participants.<br />
				  After all these steps, one can  readily and confidently enter into the actual training programme.</p>
				<h4>ASSESSMENT OF TRAINING NEEDS</h4>
				<p><strong>Training Need</strong><br />
				  Johnson ( 1967) defined training  need as matching in terms of what is going on now and what should go on now  (or) in the future and the gap if any, between these two gives due insights  into the kind and amount of training need.<br />
				  David Deshler ( 1979) identifies  four dimensions of need, four ways of viewing need. The first is felt need, the  view from the perspective of the needers when asked what  they want . 'the second dimension is expressed  need, the need that people express when they sign up for. pay for or  participate in services. The third dimension is normative need.<br />
				  This  is the option from the perspective of experts or public policy. And, the last  is comparative need, an inequity in the availability of services, all other  things being equal.<br />
				  Dugan Laird (1978) a well known  training expert, commented that a training need exists when an individual lacks  the knowledge and skills to perform an assigned task satisfactorily.<br />
  <strong>Training</strong> <strong>Need</strong> <strong>Assessment</strong><br />
				  Before organizing training programme  it is necessary to determine correctly the training needs of the group of  personnel. The training needs may be determined in three ways. <br />
				  First, from an analysis of  organisational change, the organization must change if it is successfully to  meet new conditions and so must the operations conducted within the  organisation, 'this means that the people who operate the systems, procedures  and role of the organisation must be trained to accept new jobs and new skills.<br />
				  Second, from analysis of work  problems as inefficiencies and problems within the organisation indicate that  the worker has been inadequately trained. Thirdly, training needs can be  derived from an analysis of man power wastage data. <br />
				  Comparing the performance achieved  in the job with the performance demanded by the job needs can derive the  individual training. If the worker's performance is less than that demanded by  the job, then a potential training need has been<br />
				  revealed.  Training needs could be in the areas of skill, knowledge and change in  attitudes.<br />
				  Individual requires training to  overcome problems as well as to avoid creating problematic situation in the  organisations. It has been observed that most of the problematic situations are  people -centered. When individuals have to learn new skills, replace incorrect  habits with productive habits, modify attitudes and acquire additional  knowledge, training is one of the best management tools available.<br />
  <strong>PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN PLANNING AND CONDUCT OF  TRAINING PROGRAMME</strong><br />
				  Training in an organisation is  essentially a learning process in which learning opportunities the managerial  purposefully structures, personnel and training staff, working in collaboration  or by external agents acting on their behalf. <br />
				  The aim of the process is to develop  in the organisation's employees the knowledge, skill and attitudes that have  been defined as necessary for the effective performance of their work and hence  for the achievement of organisational aim and objectives by the most effective  means.<br />
