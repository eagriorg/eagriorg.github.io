				<p align="justify"><strong>INNOVATIVE  INFORMATION SOURCES</strong><br />
				  CYBER EXTENSION IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT<br />
  <strong>            </strong>Information is an important  resource in modern agriculture. The development of computers and improvements  in telecommunications offers farmers and extension workers, many new opportunities  to obtain technical and economic information quickly and use it effectively for  their decision-making. The modern farmer is an entrepreneur who tries to grow  right crops and animals in the most profitable way. The amount of information a  farmer can and should use for his management decision is increasing rapidly.<br />
				  Previously  the mass media gave generalized advice to farmers, but with modern Information  Technology, extension can provide for each farm and farmer without visiting the  farm personally. The following are few modern information technology flows.<br />
  <strong>1.  View data:</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>This transmits the information  from a central computer by telephone line to the screen of a home television  set or a computer. The amount of information the system can store is limited  only by the capacity of its computer. The farmer interacts with the central  computer containing the database. He can request the computer to make certain  calculation by combining information from the database with information from  his own farm.  <br />
  <strong>2.  Tele text:</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>It is a system somewhat like  view data in which printed information is telecast through television rather  than transmitted through a telephone line. It has no interactive capacity and  it has a very much smaller database.<br />
  <strong>3.  Micro Computer:</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Through a microcomputer on the  farm, the farmers can process accounts and data from their farm production.  Many extension agents in industrialized countries now have microcomputers and  can make similar calculations for farmers.<br />
  <strong>4.  Net work system:</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Net work system in which view  data is connected with the microcomputer of the farmers or extension agents.  This makes it possible to use data or computer programmes from view data in the  microcomputer or to process data from the farm in the view data mainframe computer,  which can accommodate more complicated models than a microcomputer. These  network systems become important between farmers and their suppliers and  customers.  They can also be used for  extension information when they have been installed for that reason.<br />
  <strong>5.  E-Mail</strong><br />
				  E-mail is the short form  for electronic mail, which is based on the use of computers for the  transmission of messages rather than through the postal system. The E-mail  system connects a network of personal computer (PC) spread over the globe. A PC  is set up as a message server in the system. The users at other PCs can link up  with the server at any time to receive and transmit messages.<br />
				  Each  user to the E-mail system is allocated a look number or address in the E-mail  directory. To send a message, a user has to &quot;key-in&quot; the message in  his PC along with the directory numbers allotted to him and the receiver of the  message. The sender can indicate if the message is confidential or universal  and set a time limit for its retention. The receiver on receiving the message  is his/her computer terminal can get it printed on paper.<br />
				  The  main advantages of E-mail are that it cuts down the delay involved in postal  transmission of messages. Moreover, messages can be sent at any time of day or  night which are stored and can be retrieved by the recipient at his or her  convenience. Besides, once the contact between the transmitter and receiver PCs  is established E-mail requires only a few minutes time to transmit even if it  is a bulky message.<br />
  <strong>6.  Fax (Or) Facsimile</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>It is a device used for  transmission of a written document, photograph, map or any other graphic,  material electronically. It is one of the variants of E-mail. For transmission,  the original documents placed in the facsimile or fax machine which scans the  document and converts the written or graphic information into electronic  signals and establishes a link up with a similar receiving fax machine at the  receiving end. The receiving fax reconverts the electronic signals into written  or graphic form. As the sending machine scans the documents, the receiving  machine reproduces the scanned image, which is an exact duplicate of the  originals.</p>
				<p>       A typical fax machine can transmit a document of A4 size in less than a  minute over thousands of kilometers. Since fax operates through the normal  telephone lines the fax number is usually a telephone number. In addition, the  same STD and ISD codes are used for sending a fax to another city or another  country.  The document is scanned page by  page in the fax machine. Like the E-mail, fax communication eliminates the  postal delay and is very convenient for communication between persons located  in different time zones, but it costs more than the E-mail.<br />
                    <strong>7.  Internet</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>The Internet is a network of  networks, the international linking of tens of thousands of business,  universities, and research organisations with millions of individual users. The  Internet is a global electronic community of over 50,000 interconnected  computer network, which means more than 50 million people are linked together,  computing on what has been aptly termed as the &quot;information super  highway&quot;. Internet has added a new dimension to our existence by placing  within easy reach an overwhelming range of information. It gives each of us the  option to be a publisher of our information and views.<br />
				  The  Internet offers a wealth of business opportunities. More and more business  firms are advertising their services to customers on the Internet.  The Internet is a source of up-to-date  information and assistance too, related to business, stock market, education,  research, medical advances etc., Many organisations also set up an  &quot;Internet&quot;. This is a network used on the Internet to communicate and  share information across the organisation.<br />
  <strong>8.  Optical Communication Technology</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Use of light waves for  communication purposes gave rise to the modern technology of optical  communication. In this new method, optical fibers that are very thin, long  stands of ultra purity glass are being used  to link the transmitter and the receiver. Information in the form of a series  of light pulses produced by small semiconductor lasers is passed through such  fibers. At the receiving end these light pulses are converted back into  original information using appropriate detectors and decoders. Human voice, TV  pictures and computer data can be transmitted and received with great ease and  convenience using optical fiber communication techniques.<br />
  <strong>9.  Cellular Mobile</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong> It is popularly known as car telephone, and  this service allows two-way communication between a mobile or fixed telephone  and another mobile or fixed telephone. All standard facilities like STD, ISD,  Fax etc., are available with mobile phones. The mobile phones need not be fixed  to an ear but if the set is portable, one can carry it wherever he moves.<br />
  <strong>10.  Radio paging</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>It is called as poor man's  cellular telephone, facilitating one way mobile communication to users. A  person carrying a pager can be contacted while he or she is on the move, by his  office or even others. If one gets a message on his pager that he was required  and should call up the number, which flashes, on his pager, all one needs to do  is to go the nearest public call office and establish contact with his office.  In fact an extensive page-phone networks, in conjunction with radio paging, is  a good substitute for cellular network. The pagers are particularly useful for  professionals on the move.<br />
  <strong>11.  Very Small Aperture Terminal Technology (VSAT) service</strong><br />
				  This  service provides satellite-based network for business communication using the  cost effective VSAT technology.  All it  does is to link head office of company or a corporate house to its various  locations like factories, service units and other offices particularly those  located in remote areas, using satellite network. Such networks are called  Closed User Group (CUG) network. Besides high-speed data transmission from one  location to another, people can even talk on the network.<br />
  <strong>12.  Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>It enables two organisations  usually a customer and supplier to exchange routine documents such as purchase  orders and invoices using standard electronic forms and their own computers  linked through a service provider. It is faster. Cheaper and reliable means of  exchanging export documents. It works on internationally accepted protocols and  facilitates quicker exchange of documents.<br />
  <strong>13.  Voice mail</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>If one wants to enjoy the  benefits of telephone, without actually owing one, he should subscribe to voice  mail.  Get a voice mail address (similar  to a telephone number) and he can get all his calls on that number. In the  evening or any given point of time he can access his mailbox, from any  telephone to see (or listen) if there is any mail waiting for him. It is just  like owing a postbox in the post office.<br />
  <strong>14.  Video Conferencing</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Holding a  conference with one's foreign partners or addressing a press conference in four  different cities without travelling long distances has become a reality with  the advent of video conferencing.  All  one has to do is to go to the studio of the service provider at the appointed  hour and hold a videoconference, through satellite links, within India or  abroad. Such a system  cuts travel costs  and time for executives of top companies. <br />
  <strong>KISAN</strong><strong> CALL   CENTER</strong><strong> (</strong><strong>1800-180-1551)</strong><br />
				  The country today has  an impressive telecom network both in the private and Government sector. Over 5  lakh villages have a public telephone in the country. It has been felt for long  that this impressive telecom network could be put to effective use for delivering  knowledge and information to the farming community. A call centre based  extension service will be delivering knowledge and information exactly as per  the requirements of the farming community. This system would also help to keep  a record of what is being delivered to the farmers in terms of  knowledgeandinformation. The Kisan Call Centre scheme is available throughout  the country. The Kisan Call Centrescheme has been functioning from 21.1.04.<strong>The Call Centres can be accessed by farmers all over the  country on common Toll Free Number </strong><strong>1800-180-1551</strong><strong>. </strong>Since 10th June, 2004, the Call Centres service has been made  available right from 6 A.M. to 10 P.M. except on Sundays and gazetted holidays,  beyond these hours the calls are attended in the voice recording mode. <br />
  <strong>KISAN CALL CENTRE - Concept</strong><br />
				  The challenges before Indian Agriculture are immense.&nbsp; This  sector needs to grow at a faster rate than in the past to allow for higher per  capita income and consumption.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About two thirds of workforce  directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture.&nbsp; This sector generates  about 28 percent of its GDP and over 15 percent of exports.&nbsp; Rising  consumer prosperity and the search by farmers for higher incomes will  simultaneously drive crop diversification.&nbsp; Export opportunities for  agricultural products are also expected to continue to grow, provided India could  meet the stability, quality and presentation standards demanded by foreign  trade and consumers and maintain its comparative advantage as a relatively low  cost producer. <br />
				  Given its range of agro-ecological setting and producers, Indian Agriculture is  faced with a great diversity of needs, opportunities and prospects.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The well endowed irrigated areas which account for 37 percent of the country's  cultivated land currently contribute about 55 percent of agricultural  production, whereas, rainfed agriculture which covers 63 percent accounts for  only 45 percent of agricultural production.&nbsp;&nbsp; In these less favorable  areas, yields are not only low but also highly unstable and technology gaps are  much wider as compared to those in irrigated areas.                            If it is to respond  successfully to these challenges, greater attention will have to be paid to  information-based technologies. Both technology generation and transfer will  have to focus more strongly than ever before on the themes of optimization in  the management of their available resources by producers. In order to make  information transfer more effective, greater use will need to be made of modern  information technology and communication among researchers, extensionists and  farmers have to be utilized.<br />
				  Public extension system requires a paradigm shift from top-down,  blanket dissemination of technological packages, towards providing producers  with the knowledge and understanding with which they solve their own location -  specific problems.&nbsp; Continuous two-way interaction among the farmers and  agricultural scientists is the most critical component of Agricultural  Extension.&nbsp;<br />
				  At present, the issues have been addressed by the Extension  Systems of State Departments of Agriculture, State Agricultural Universities  (SAUs), KVKs, NGOs, Private Extension Services through various extension  approaches in transfer of technology. With the availability of telephone and  Internet, it is now possible to bridge this gap to quite a large extent by  using an appropriate mix of technologies.<br />
				  The Department of Agriculture &amp; Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture, Govt.  of India has&nbsp;launched Kisan Call Centers with a view to leverage the  extensive telecom infrastructure in the country to deliver extension services  to the farming community. The purpose of these Call Centers is mainly to  respond to issues raised by farmers instantly in the local language, on  continuous basis. </p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Details of the Scheme:</strong> </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>The  Indian Agriculture is on the threshold of a second revolution. It is becoming  increasingly clear that the next leap will come from the information and the  knowledge transfer to the agriculture sector, together with the other  traditional inputs and interventions. The real challenge before the policy  makers is to overcome the information asymmetry between farmer and farmer,  village and village, region and region and the country as a whole versus other  countries. &nbsp;Fortunately, the developments in the field of communication  and information technology in India  make it possible to attempt this task.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
				  <li>The  country today has an impressive telecom network both in the private and  Government sector. Over 5 lakh villages have a public telephone in the country.  It has been felt for long that this impressive telecom network could be put to  effective use for delivering knowledge and information to the farming  community. With the limited number of extension workers, there is a need to use  the latest technologies for delivering extension services. &nbsp;Towards this,  the Department of&nbsp; Agriculture and&nbsp; Cooperation has been working on  schemes to use both Mass-Media and telecom network for the delivery of  extension services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
				  <li>One  of the draw-backs experienced in the current human resource based extension  service has been that the monitoring authorities are not able to get a clear  feed back on the quality of extension services being delivered in the villages.  On the other hand a call centre based extension service will be delivering  knowledge and information exactly as per the requirements of the farming  community. This system would also help keep a record of what is being delivered  to the farmers in terms of knowledge and information.</li>
				  <li>The  objective of the scheme has been to make agriculture knowledge available at  free of cost to the farmers as and when desired.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
				  <li>This  scheme has an in-built system of monitoring and continuous evaluation for  modifications and improvements. The services are also of a foundational nature.  &nbsp;Many more exciting tiers will be built on this infrastructure.</li>
				  <li>The  Kisan Call Centre scheme is available all over the country. At present the Call  Centre services are available at a common toll free telephone number which can  be dialed from anywhere in the country. The location is immaterial as the calls  can originate from any village to land at a specific call centre and a specific  seat which would be answered by an agriculture graduate knowing the local  language and having an understanding&nbsp; of the local agricultural issues.</li>
				  <li>The  call centres as operational today have been selected on the basis of a tender  document which was floated by TCIL, a Govt. of India Company which was  appointed by Department of Agriculture &amp; Cooperation as the consultant.</li>
				  <li>The  Kisan Call Centre scheme has been functioning from 21.1.04. The Call Centres  can be accessed by farmers all over the country on common Toll Free Number  1551.</li>
</ol>
				<p>The calls are received at 13 Call  Centres wherein 116 Agriculture Graduates attend to answer the queries of the  farmer in the local language. 123 experts located in different parts of the  country at State Agriculture Universities, ICAR institutes, State Department of  Agriculture, Horticulture and other developments are answering the calls at  Level –II. <br />
                    <strong>New Initiatives:</strong> </p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Since 10th June, 2004 the       Call Centres service has been made available right from 6 A.M. to 10 P.M.       except on Sundays and gazetted holidays, beyond these hours the calls are       attended in the IVRS mode.</li>
</ol>
				<p><strong>Operational Mechanism </strong><br />
				  The Kisan Call Center is a synthesis of two hitherto  separate technologies namely, the Information&nbsp; &amp; Communication  Technology (ICT) and the Agricultural Technology.&nbsp; To optimally utilize  the strengths of both these systems, it was proposed to take full advantage of  professionally managed Call Centre mechanism and dovetail it with the  specialized knowledge of Agricultural Scientists and Extension Officers, so as  to facilitate its reach to the farming community.&nbsp; Accordingly&nbsp;&nbsp;  existing specialized&nbsp; infrastructure of Call Centers (which are normally  industry-driven and serve to high-end and many a times, mission critical  service sector) are made available to the Subject Matter Specialists of  Agriculture, Horticulture, Animal Husbandry, Marketing and other related  areas.&nbsp; The Kisan Call Center, consists of three levels – namely <strong>Level-I</strong> (the basic Call Center interface, with high quality bandwidth and local  language proficient Agriculture graduate), <strong>Level-II</strong> (Subject  Matter Specialists on concerned important crops and enterprises, connected  through good bandwidth telecom and computer connectivity) and <strong>Level-III</strong> (the Management Group to ensure ultimate answering and resolution of all the  farmers’ queries which are not resolved at Level-II, connected on off line  mode).<br />
  <strong>Level –I:</strong>&nbsp; The  call coming to the call center is picked up by an operator (level –I  functionary) who after a short welcome message takes down the basic information  and the query of the caller.&nbsp; These details are fed into a computer  located next to the operator by the operator himself.&nbsp; At the first level,  receiver of the call would also feeds into the computer the question being  asked by the farmer.&nbsp; <br />
				  The first level operators preferably  would be an agricultural graduate with rural background knowing local language.  They should also posses’ good communication skills.&nbsp; They would be in a  position to answer a majority of the questions likely to be asked by the  farmers. <br />
  <strong>Level-II:</strong>&nbsp; The  level –II consists of Subject Matter Specialists (SMS) who are located at their  respective place (Research Stations, ATICs, KVKs, Agricultural colleges), of  work.&nbsp; In case the first level operator is not able to answer the  question, the operator forwards (in call sharing mode) the call to the  concerned Subject Matter Specialist.&nbsp; The data relating to the caller  including the question asked is also be transferred to the Level-II functionary  on his computer along with the call.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, when the specialist  takes the forwarded call, his computer also shows the data and question asked  so that there is no repetition. It is envisaged that in normal cases, the  entire spill over questions from the first level get answered at this  level.&nbsp; In case, it is not possible to answer, there is a system to revert  back to the caller by post / fax / e-mail or by telephone in 72 hours.&nbsp;<br />
				  While selecting the specialists, it  would be important to first identify the major crops in that state and the  issues on which the questions are likely to be asked.&nbsp; These specialists  should be such that they will answer most of the questions that are likely to  be asked.&nbsp; There could be two options available on the selections of the  specialists.&nbsp; <br />
				  One option could be to select  commodity wise specialist, that is, every question related to a particular crop  or commodity would be directed to that specialist, who would in turn answer  that question. Other option could be to select general specialists who would  deal with various subjects likely to arise.&nbsp; The specialists should  ideally be located within a city.&nbsp; They should have good communication  skills and should know the local language.&nbsp; These specialists should have  at least a minimum of 10-15 years of field experience in their respective  specialization.&nbsp; <br />
  <strong>Level – III:</strong>&nbsp; The  level –III consists of a dedicated cell located at the Nodal Office. This would  receive the questions that have not been answered at the first and the second  levels.&nbsp; Appropriate replies to these questions whould be then framed in  consultation with the concerned specialists available within or outside the  State, by the nodal cell.&nbsp; The replies would be sent to the farmers  promptly by post/e-mail/fax/ telephone etc. within 72 hours of receipt of the  question. <strong>Knowledge Management System</strong> </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>The  Knowledge Management System is a software tool which has been developed by the  Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd. (TCIL) a Government of India  enterprise. The Kisan Call Centre shall be accessible on identified telephone  number will provide all technical assistance to the caller and will record the  queries along with the personal details.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
				  <li>The  Knowledge Management System shall be supported by the data base built up using  the asked questions and their answers. The Kisan Call Centre report generation  software will be provided the user interface forms in which the call Centre  Agents has to put the parameter according to which he want the report to get  generated. The report/data generated like date wise, crop wise, location wise,  district wise, state wise, problem wise, level wise, call type wise, All India  level wise will be available at the users end. The data generated through this  Knowledge Management System will be available on internet after hosting. </li>

				<p>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS <br />
				  Access to information and improved communication is a  crucial requirement for sustainable agricultural development. Modern  communication technologies when applied to conditions in rural areas can help  improve communication, increase participation, disseminate information and  share knowledge and skills. It is being said that &quot;Cyber Extension&quot;  would be the major form of technology dissemination in the near future.<br />
				  However, it is observed that the rural population still has  difficulty in accessing crucial information in order to make timely decisions.  It is essential that information availability is demand driven rather than  supply driven. The challenge is not only to improve the accessibility of  communication technology to the rural population but also to improve its  relevance to local development.<br />
				  Considering the critical need for access to timely  information and improved communication, this issue focuses on attempts made in  different countries to transfer information to the rural population and success  stories of such attempts. Bridging the '&quot;last mile&quot; between the haves  and have nots will ensure that remote rural communities are better informed.</p>
				<p><strong>Bridging  the &quot;last mile&quot;</strong><br />
				  Improved  communication and information access is directly related to social and economic  development. However it is observed that the rural population still have  difficulty in accessing crucial information in forms they can understand in  order to make timely decisions. There is a concern that the gap between the  information rich and information poor is getting wider.<br />
				  New  information and communication technologies are generating possibilities to  solve problems of rural poverty, inequality, and giving an opportunity to  bridge the gap between information-rich and information-poor and support  sustainable development in rural and agricultural communities. However remote  rural communities still lack basic communication infrastructure.<br />
				  The challenge is not only to improve the accessibility of  communication technology to the rural population but also to improve the  relevance of information to local development.<br />
  <strong>Technology in rural communication </strong><br />
				  A range of communication technologies have been used to  meet the information needs of the rural population. These include rural radio,  participatory video using a methodology called Rural Audiovisual pedagogy which  uses participatory video as a communication tool for mediating between rural  peoples needs and possible sources of information and expertise to respond to  these needs.<br />
				  The Internet is emerging as a tool with potential to  contribute to rural development. Internet enables rural communities to receive  information and assistance from other development organizations; offers  opportunities for two-way communication. It can also support bottom-up  articulation of development needs and perceptions, and thus help in reducing  the isolation of rural communities. It can facilitate dialogue among  communities and with government planners, development agencies, researchers,  and technical experts; encourage community participation in decision making;  and help agricultural researchers, technicians, farmers and others in sharing  information. <br />
				  A survey of Internet use in rural areas was conducted by  Dr. Don Richardson and others in 1996. Rural Internet users indicate that the  Internet provides them with a very convenient method for quickly accessing a  large volume of information without being impeded by geographic barriers. They  also report finding information of value from the Internet in the form of new  ideas, discussion groups, access to expert advice, continuing education  resources, increased global understanding and cultural awareness. Social  benefits include new opportunities to overcome geographic isolation, increased  social interaction, opportunities to organize and advocate for social change,  equalization of urban/rural disparities and new links between urban and rural  communities. <br />

				  Telecentres<br />
				  An approach  that is being explored for providing rural access to modern information and  communication technologies is through &quot;telecentres&quot; or  &quot;telecottages&quot;. The concept was first implemented in Sweden.  Telecentres are centers located in isolated rural communities and have personal  computers, printers, a modem, a fax machine, and a consultant. According to the  Telecottage Association of UK, there are 120 telecottages in the United Kingdom, 49 in Finland,  40 in Australia, and 23 in Sweden and in Germany,  Portugal, Ireland, Denmark,  Canada, Norway, and Brazil. Some of their services  include telephone and fax facilities, e-mail, Internet and electronic networks,  access to databases and libraries. They can also link the Internet to local  media such as radio and television and thus make information accessible to a  wider audience. Telecentres not only facilitate single-point access to external  information services (e.g. Government marketing and price information) or to  global information through the WWW, but also help in organization of virtual  village-to-village meetings and tele-training events thus facilitating local  sharing of information. <br />

				  Many efforts are taking place throughout the developing  world to give the rural population a sense of conceitedness by providing  innovative methods to access information and to communicate/facilitate exchange  of information among themselves and with other agencies. These are documented  in the following pages.<br />
				  Harnessing IT: Indian Scenario<br />
				  There are cases of application of information and  communication technologies that have made a difference in the delivery of  services in rural India.  Some of these include the Warana Wired village Project in Maharashtra; Milk  collection in dairy co-operatives (National dairy Development Board);  Information Villages Project (MS Swaminathan Research Foundation-International  Development Research Centre); Information Technology application for Indian  Rural Postal System (CMC Limited, Hyderabad); Knowledge Network for grassroots  innovations (IIM, Ahmedabad); Application of Satellite Communication for  Training Field Workers and Extension Workers in Rural Areas( ISRO);  Computerisation of Mandal Revenue Offices (MROs) and computer aided  administration of revenue department in Andhra Pradesh (Government of Andhra  Pradesh. <br />
				  In the Warana Wired Village Project covering 70 villages in  Maharashtra the existing cooperative structure  has been used with state of the art infrastructure to allow Internet access to  existing cooperative societies.&nbsp; The aim is to provide information to  villagers by establishing networked booths in the villages.&nbsp;<br />
				  The Information Villages Project of the MS Swaminathan  Research Foundation is aimed at bringing the benefits of modern information and  communication technologies to rural families in Pondicherry. A Value Addition Centre which is  the hub of the information network has been established in Villianur village  and four information shops have been established in different villages.<br />
				  National Dairy Development Board. IT-based machines are  being used at milk collection centres, and in cooperatives to measure butterfat  content of milk, test the quality of milk, and promptly make payment to the  farmers.&nbsp; It has resulted in the removal of incentives to cut the milk by  adding water, reduced time for payments from 10 days to less than five&nbsp;  minutes, and instilled confidence in farmers in the cooperative set up. All of  these factors have helped the milk market to expand. <br />
				  A CMC pilot project has installed a Computerized Universal  Postal System and a Centralised Accounting and Reporting System in three post offices  in Andhra Pradesh.&nbsp; The technology is designed for rural environments. The  systems handle multifunctions within a postal office, reduce errors and waiting  time, and provide transparent transactions. <br />
				  ICT can help empower the knowledge rich but economically  poor people. Under the &quot;Honey-Bee&quot; knowledge network (of the IIM,  Ahmedabad) used to augment grassroots inventors and overcome language, literacy  and localism a large number of grass root inventions have been identified and  documented as short multimedia presentations. Future plans include creating a  database of such innovations and making them accessible via a wide area  network.<br />
				  One way video, two way audio teleconferencing interactive  networks have been used for education and training by Indian Space Research  Organisation.&nbsp; The major application of the network in rural development  was for training extension staff from various departments of the state  governments.&nbsp; In addition, a large number of women, Panchayati Raj elected  officials, primary school teachers, and child development workers spread over  large distances have been trained.&nbsp;<br />
				  Information and communication technologies are an important  part of&nbsp; the Government of Andhra Pradesh’s efforts to improve the  efficiency of&nbsp; its administrative offices. AP is the first state in India  to design a statewide computerization program that will be used in rural areas,  at the mandal-level&nbsp;( the administrative unit above the village-level  panchayat).&nbsp; There are 1124 mandals in the state. The first software application,  is the issuance of&nbsp; certificates pertaining to land holdings, caste,  nativity and income across a common counter, without the current delay of 15 to  20-days.<br />
				  The AP State Wide Area Network (APSWAN), aims to link the  state government’s Secretariat with 23 District Headquarters, serving as the  backbone for &quot;multi-services&quot; (voice, video, and data) that would be  used for improved co-ordination between state headquarters and district offices  in managing various regulatory, developmental, and hazard mitigation programs  of the state government.&nbsp; Mandals will be served by&nbsp; this two-way  communication, and electronic commerce applications will be developed. The AP  Value Added Network Services project hopes to deliver a variety of public  services through a large network of information kiosks. <br />
				  The Computer-aided Administration of Registration  Department (CARD), a project of A.P. aims to introduce a transparent system of  property valuation, which is easily accessible to citizens.</p>
