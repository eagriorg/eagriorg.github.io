				<p align="justify"><strong>EXTENSION  TEACHING METHODS</strong><br />
				  Extension is an  educational process for bringing about the maximum number of desirable changes  among the people, which involves both learning &amp; teaching &amp; needs some  tools or methods commonly known as extension-teaching methods. It is,  therefore, necessary here to understand what is meant by learning, teaching  &amp; extension methods.<br />
				  'Learning' is the process by which an individual, through his own activity,  attains a change in his behaviour. It is an active process on the part of the  learner. The essential role of an extension worker is to create effective  'learning situations'. An effective learning situation requires the following  essential elements:</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ol>
				    <li> An instructor  (an extension worker, e.g. an extension officer or a village-level worker).</li>
				    <li>Learners (the farmers, the farm women &amp; the youth).</li>
				    <li>Subject-matter (the recommended improved practices,  such as the seeds of high-yielding varieties,<a href="http://www.krishiworld.com/html/soil_ferti1.html">fertilisers</a>, balanced  diet, etc.)</li>
				    <li>Teaching material, such as a flannel-board, a  black-board, charts, models, samples,     slides, film strips, etc.</li>
				    <li>Physical facilities, such as sitting accomodation, good  visibility, etc.</li>
			      </ol>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">The extension  worker should skillfully manipulate the elements of the learning situation  &amp; provide satisfactory learning experiences for the people. The farmer, the  farmer women or the farm youth are the focal points in the learning situation.  The main aim of an extension worker is to bring about a change in this  behaviour of the people with the help of a judicious combination &amp; use of  different elements. all the teaching should be carried out according to the  needs &amp; resources of the local community or group.<br />
				  'Teaching' is  the process of arranging situations in which the things to be learnt are  brought to the notice of the learners, their interest is developed &amp; desire  aroused, i.e. they are stimulated to action.for example, if we want to teach  the farmers the use &amp; advantages of chemical&nbsp;<a href="http://www.krishiworld.com/html/soil_ferti1.html">fertilisers</a>, we do  this by conducting demonstrations on their&nbsp;<a href="http://www.krishiworld.com/html/field_crops1.html">fields</a>, showing  them how the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.krishiworld.com/html/soil_ferti1.html">fertilisers</a>&nbsp;are applied, &amp; compare the yield  of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.krishiworld.com/html/soil_ferti1.html">fertilised</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.krishiworld.com/html/comm_crops1.html">crop</a>&nbsp;with that of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.krishiworld.com/html/comm_crops1.html">crop</a>&nbsp;to which no&nbsp;<a href="http://www.krishiworld.com/html/soil_ferti1.html">fertilisers</a>&nbsp;has ben applied. After seeing the  beneficial effect of a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.krishiworld.com/html/soil_ferti1.html">fertilisers</a>, the  farmer is convinced &amp; motivated to action &amp; starts using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.krishiworld.com/html/soil_ferti1.html">fertilisers</a>&nbsp;regularly.<br />
  <strong>Extension-teaching methods:</strong><br />
  &nbsp;The extension-teaching methods are the  tools &amp; techniques used to create situations in which communication can  take place between the rural people &amp; the extension workers. They are the  methods of extending new knowledge &amp; skills to the rural people by drawing  their attention towards them, arousing their interest &amp; helping them to  have a sucessful experience of the new practice. A proper understanding of  these methods &amp; their selection for a particular type of work are  necessary.<br />
  <strong>Classification of extension  teaching methods.</strong>&nbsp;<br />
				  (A)ACCORDING TO USE.&nbsp;<br />
				  One way of classifying the  extension methods is according to their use &amp; nature of contact. In other  words, whether they are used for contacting people individually, in groups or&nbsp;<em>in masses</em>. Based upon the  nature of contact, they are divided into individual, group &amp; mass-contact  methods.<br />
  <strong><em>Individual-contact methods</em></strong><em>.</em>&nbsp;Extension methods under this category  provide opportunities for face-to-face or person-to-person contact between the  rural people &amp; the extension workers. These methods are very effective in  teaching new skills &amp; creating goodwill between farmers &amp; the extension  workers.<br />
  <br />
  <strong><em>Group-contact methods</em></strong><em>.</em>&nbsp;Under this category, the rural people  or farmers are contacted in a group which usually consists of 20 to 25 persons.  These groups are usually formed around a common interest. These methods also  involve a face-to-face contact with the people &amp; provide an opportunity for  the exchange of ideas, for discussions on problems &amp; technical  recommendations &amp; finally for deciding the future course of action.<br />
  <br />
  <strong><em>Mass or community-contact methods</em></strong><em>.</em>&nbsp;An extension worker has to approach a  large number of people for disseminating a new informaton &amp; helping them to  use it. this can be done through mass-contact methods conveniently. These  methods are more useful for making people aware of the new agricultural  technology quickly.<br />
  <br />
				  Important extension-teaching methods under these 3 categories are listed in the  following chart.</p>
