				<p align="justify"><strong>EXTENSION PROGRAMME PLANNING AND EVALAUTION</strong><br />
				  To understand the extension  programme planning process, certain basic concepts of an extension programme,  planning and extension planning need to be understood.<br />
  <strong>Extension programme</strong><br />
				  The word 'programme' has several  distinct meanings in the dictionary. It mans a proclamation, a prospectus, a  list of events, a plan of procedure, a course of action prepared or announced  before hand, a logical sequence of operations to be performed in solving a problem.  When used by an organization, it means a prospectus or a statement issued to  promote understanding and interest  in an  enterprise.<br />
				  According to Kelsey and Hearne (1949), an  &quot;extension programme&quot; is a statement of situation, objectives,  problems and solutions'.<br />
				  According to the USDA (1956), an  &quot;extension programme&quot; is arrived at co-operatively by the local  people and the extension staff and includes a statement of: </p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>The situation in which the people are located;</li>
				    <li>The problems that are a part of the local situation;</li>
				    <li>The objectives and goals of the local people in  relation to these problems; and</li>
				    <li>The recommendations or solutions to reach these  objectives on a long-time  basis (may be several years) or on a short-time basis (may           be one year or less).</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">Leagans (1961)  says that an &quot;extension programme&quot; is a set of clearly defined,  consciously conceived objectives or ends, derived from an adequate analysis of  the situation, which are to be achieved through extension teaching activity'.<br />
				  Lawrence  (1962) says that an &quot;extension programme&quot; is the sum total of all the  activities and undertakings of a county extension services. It includes: (i)  programme planning process; (ii) written programme statement; (iii) plan of  work; (iv) programme execution; (v) results; and (vi) evaluation.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>From the above definitions, it is clear that an  extension programme:</li>
				    <li>Is a written statement;</li>
				    <li>Is the end product of extension programme  planning;</li>
				    <li>Includes a statement of situation, objectives,  problems and solutions;</li>
				    <li>Is relatively permanent but requires constant  revision;</li>
				    <li>May include long-term as well as short-term  programme objectives;</li>
				    <li>Forms the basis of extension teaching plans;</li>
				    <li>Has been drawn up in advance; and</li>
				    <li>Has been built on the basis of content.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">So, we can  define an <strong>extension programme</strong> as a  written statement of situation, objectives, problems and solutions which has  been prepared on the basis of an adequate and systematic planning effort and  which forms the basis of extension teaching activities in a specific area, for  a given period.<br />
				  <strong>Definitions</strong> for a set of important terminologies in this regard would provide the needed  clarity :<br />
				  <strong>Programme </strong>is a written statement containing a more pertinent  factual data used in decision-making, the problems agreed upon with priority  assignment and the possible solutions to the problems'.<br />
				  <strong>Plan or Plan of work</strong> is an outline of activities so arranged as to  enable efficient execution of the entire programme. It answers the questions of  what, why, how, when, where and by whom the work is to be done. <br />
				  <strong>Project</strong> is a single item of the annual plant containing the method of solution of a  single selected problem<br />
				  <strong>Calendar  of work</strong> is a plan of work arranged chronologically, according to the time  when step of work is to be done. It is a time schedule of work.<br />
				  <strong>Aim</strong> is a broad objective. It is a generalised statement of direction and may have  several objectives. It is also said to be an end in view to give direction to  the creative process.<br />
				  <strong>Objective</strong> is a direction of  movement. A well  stated objective is always measurable. It is also said to be a goal of growth.<br />
				  <strong>Goal</strong> is a distance in any given direction, proposed to be covered in a given time.<br />
  <strong>Planning</strong><br />
				  The basic concept of planing appears to  be well accepted in our culture. It is regarded as an integral and important  dimension of our culture's rational value orientation. Rational value  orientation assumes a conscious systematic approach to problem solving, i.e.,  problem definition, data gathering and choosing between alternative ends and  means on the basis of predetermined criteria. Almost everyone accepts the  premise that planning is important and necessary for individuals, for families  and for business organizations. The most effective planning effort would be  that 'which achieves the greatest degree of performance of the actions, motions  or operations implied by a set of planning concepts which depict the ideal  process (Boyle, 1965).<br />
  <strong>Assumptions on Extension Planning</strong><br />
				  The  concept of extension planning is based on a number of assumptions. Boyle (1965)  has listed the following assumptions in this regard:</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Planning change is a necessary prerequisite to  effective social progress for people and communities.</li>
				    <li>The most desirable change is predetermined and  democratically achieved.</li>
				    <li>Extension education programmes, if properly planned and  implemented, can make a significant contribution to planned change.</li>
				    <li>It is possible to select, organize and administer a  programme that will contribute to the social and economic progress of people.</li>
				    <li>People and communities need the guidance, leadership  and help of extension educators to solve their problems in a planned and  systematic way.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Extension Programme Planning </strong><br />
				  Having described the concepts of planning  and extension programme, now the stage is set to examine the concept of  extension programme planning. A few points need to be explicated before  attempting a definition.<br />
  <strong>1. Extension programme planning is a  process:</strong><br />
				  The dictionary meaning of 'process' is  'any phenomenon which shows a continuous change in time' or 'any continuous  operation or treatment'. If we accept this concept of process, we view events  and relationships as dynamic, ongoing, ever-changing and continuous.  When we label something as a process, we also mea that it does not have a  beginning, an end, a fixed sequence of events. It is not static, at rest. The  basis for the concept of process is the belief that man cannot discover the  structure of physically reality; man must create it.           <br />
				  This definition of process suggests that  'a process is involved in which a series of actions culminates in the  accomplishment of a goal' (Boyle, 1965). Viewed in this way, the concept of  process involves a method, i.e., a process should be viewed as a sequential set  of steps or several systematically ordered steps of planning, the performance  of which leads to the accomplishment of a goal. In extension programme  planning, the immediate goal would be the development of a programme document.<br />
				  The concept a person has of the extension  programme planning process will affect actions and mode of researching the  process. Many programme-planning processes take place at any particular time at  different levels of the extension organization. For example, programme planning  occurs at the national level (five-year plans), at the state level (state plans, annual  plans of work) and at the block level. In fact, planning at the block level is  taking place when:</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>The long-time plan or projected  plan is being developed;</li>
				    <li>The schematic budget is being planned;</li>
				    <li>The annual plan of work is being developed;</li>
				    <li>Detailed plans for individual learning  experiences are developed with a major project.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>2.Extension programme planning is a  decision</strong><strong>-making process.</strong><br />
				  Planning is basically a decision-making  process-  and so is extension programme planning. In extension programme planning,  scientific facts are put to value judgements of the people through the  implementation of a rational planning model in order to decide a programme  which will be carried out through the extension teaching activities.<br />
  <strong>3.Extension programme planning requires  advance thinking:</strong> <br />
				  If  we could know 'where we are' and 'where we are to go' we could better judge  'what to do' and 'how to do'. This statement lies at the heart of the nature of  planning. Panning does not take place in a vacuum or automatically. It has to  be made to happen.The most basic fact giving rise to planning is that effective  rural development result from choice, not from chance; it results from design,  not from drift. Good extension programme planning is an intellectual activity  since it usually involves a study and use of facts and principles. It requires  knowledge, imagination and reasoning ability. It is a complex exercise as it  involves people their needs, their interests, useful technology, educational  process, analyzing a situation and making decision about what should be done,  determining useful actions, projecting the desired shape of things in future  and several other components, which are rarely simple.<br />
  <strong>4.Extension programme planning requires kill and ability on the part of  planners: </strong><br />
				  Planning  effective extension education programmes requires a number of high-level  professional skills. Needed abilities include understanding and skill in the  following broad areas:</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Understanding the nature and role of extension  education organization.</li>
				    <li>Knowledge and understanding of the technology  related to the subject with which the programme is concerned.</li>
				    <li>Ability to clarify the objectives of a programme  and to so state them that they are useful in guiding its execution.</li>
				    <li>Skill at seeing the relationship between  principles and practice.</li>
				    <li>Skill at inquiry and human relationships.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>5.Extension programme planning is built  round content:</strong> <br />
				  A  programme regarding any extension activity can only be built on the basis of  content. Without some express purpose, there can be no planning. Extension  programme planning is build around available improved technology, the people,  their resources, problems, needs and interests.<br />
  <strong>6.Extension programme planning is a social  action process:</strong><br />
				  Extension programme planning involves  interaction and the decisions so taken in the form of a programme affect  others. Interaction assumes some type of communication between two or more  people in the planning process. So when the extension staff involving  specialists and people's representatives decides on the programme content for  extension teaching for the coming year, it is involved in social planning. In  this process, the scientific data is put to value judgements so as to decide  the intended direction of change and also the appropriate methods to be used to  reach these goals. Further, the resultant programme has many social  consequences in terms of interaction with other people, e.g., to inform them,  educate them, persuade them, in order to introduce improved technology into  their minds and actions.<br />
  <strong>7.Extension programme planning is a  collaborative effort: </strong><br />
				  Extension  programme planning is a collaborative effort involving identification,  assessment, evaluation of needs, problems, resources, priorities and solutions.<br />
  <strong>8.Extension programme planning is a system:</strong><br />
				  Extension programme planning is a system as its  procedures and processes are interrelated, ordered and linked progressively to  form a collective whole. It includes several subprocesses, such as planning,  designing, implementing, evaluation etc.<br />
  <strong>9.The end</strong><strong>-product  of extension programme planning is an extension programme: </strong><br />
				  The first consideration for anyone  who is to concern himself with a process or set of procedures for planning is  to clearly identify the primary purpose of the planning process to be  developed. Many have suggested that the purpose of planning is for educating  those who participate. According to Vanderberg (1965), 'the primary purpose of  any planning, first and foremost is that of developing a sound, defensible and  progressive course of action or plan. In the process followed, many other  benefits might accrue, such as the education of participants, but we want a  plan which can and will be used'.</p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Extension programme planning defined</strong><br />
				  Having said that extension programme  planning is a social action, decision- making, inter actional  process in which advance thinking is needed for identifying the needs,  interests and resources of the people through educational means to prepare a  blueprint for action we are now ready to formally define this concept. However,  it appears appropriate here to first list some of the definitions of <strong>extension programme planning </strong>as given  in the literature.<br />
				  1.Programme planing is viewed as  a process through which representatives of the people are intensively involved  with extension personnel and other professional people in four activities  (Boyle, 1965):</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Studying facts and trends;</li>
				    <li>Identifying problems and opportunities based on  these facts and trends;</li>
				    <li>Making decisions about problems and  opportunities that should be given priority; and</li>
				    <li>Establishing objectives or recommendations for  future economic and social development of a community through educational  programmes.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">2.This are the  process whereby the people in the country, through their leaders, plan their  extension programme. Country and state professional extension staff members  assist in this process. The end-result of this process is a written programme statement  (Lawrence,  1962).<br />
				  3.Extension programme planning  is the process of determining, developing and executing programmes. It is a  continuous process, whereby farm people, with the guidance and leadership of  extension personnel, attempt to determine, analyse and solve local problems. In  this, there are three characteristics:</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>What needs to be done;</li>
				    <li>When it should be done; and</li>
				    <li>How it should be done (Musgraw, 1962).</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">4.An organized  and purposeful process, initiated and guided by the agent, to involve a  particular group of people in the process of studying their interests, needs  and problems, deciding upon and planning education and other actions to change  their situation in desired ways and making commitments regarding the role and  responsibilities of the participants (Olson, 1962).<br />
				  An analysis of these and other  definitions of extension programme planning implies that it:</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Is a decision-making, social process;</li>
				    <li>Involves advance thinking;</li>
				    <li>Is a progressive step-by-step process;</li>
				    <li>Uses educational means in defining the goals and  situations;</li>
				    <li>Is built around improved technology, people,  their needs, interests, resources, values, attitudes and skills; and</li>
				    <li>The end-product is a written  statement of situation, problems, objectives and solutions.</li>
				    <li>Thus extension programme planning may be defined  as:</li>
				    <li>A decision-making, social-action  process in which extension educationists involve people's representatives,</li>
				    <li>To determine their needs, problems, resources  and priorities,</li>
				    <li>In order to decide on an extension programme  consisting of situation analysis, problems, objectives and solutions,</li>
				    <li>Which will form the basis of extension teaching  plans for a given period.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<h2 align="justify">Rationale of programme planning</h2>
				<p align="justify"><strong>1.Progress requires a design</strong>: Effective  education is a result of design not drift; it results from a plan-not  from trial and error. The experience of workers in education and in other  educational agencies has been that progress is made most effectively when a  plan of action is set forth and followed. The pay-off for educational effort  comes when people change their behaviour to improve their situation. These  results come most rapidly when careful planning is done and when effective  teaching methods are used.<br />
                    <strong>2.Planning gives direction:</strong> There are  no tests for directing the people's learning in extension. This arguments the  difficulty of designing a plan and underscores the fact that planning is one of  the most important jobs of extension workers.<br />
				  In planning or constructing a course  of study, the teacher should be guided by five major factors: (1) the purpose  for which the course is offered, its aims; (2) the characteristics and needs of  those who are to take the course; (3) the educational environment of these  persons; (4) the sources of information available; and (5) the requirements or  demands of the vocation or other uses to which the learning is to be put. These  factors apply to the development of extension programmes as well as to the curriculum  of the public schools. The factors that apply to the study of a situation will  be considered more closely a little later.<br />
  <strong>3.Effective learning requires a plan:</strong> There must be consciously directed effort on the part of the teacher to give  guidance to the learning process. The direction of this teaching effort can  best be stated in terms of objectives. They must be developed with the people  to be taught and must be capable of attainment by and with the people  concerned.<br />
  <strong>4.Planning precedes action:</strong> The results  of an action are dependent on the following: adequacy of analysis of the  problems, situation of objectives and involvement of the people. Through the  planning process, questions such as these are posed:<br />
				  i.  What information do farm men and women need most?<br />
				  ii.  Which kind of information shall be extended?<br />
				  iii.  What information shall be extended first?<br />
				  iv.  How much time shall be devoted to this line of work?<br />
				  v.  How much effort shall be devoted to this line of work?<br />
				  The  answers to these questions lie in the programme planning process.<br />
				  Kelsey and Hearne (1949) have given the following rationale  for a planned extension programme .According to them, sound extension programme  planning:</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Is based on analysis of the facts in  the situation; </li>
			      </ul>
				  <ol start="2" type="1">
				    <li>selects problems based on needs;</li>
				    <li>determines objectives and solutions which offer       satisfaction; </li>
				    <li>reflects performance with flexibility; </li>
				    <li>incorporate balance with emphasis; </li>
				    <li>envisages a definite plan of work; </li>
				    <li>is a continuous process; </li>
				    <li>is a teaching process; </li>
				    <li>is a coordinating process; </li>
				    <li>involves local people and their institutions; and </li>
				    <li>provides for evaluation of results.</li>
			      </ol>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">            Thus it could be said that planning  programmes is an integral part of the development process and ensures better  and efficient utilization of resources, accountability and human development.<br />
                    <strong>Principles of programme planning</strong><br />
				  After a critical analysis of the  programme planning principles available in extension literature, Sandhu (1965)  identified a set of principles that may be applicable in developing countries.<br />
  <strong>I.Programme</strong><br />
  <strong>1.Extension programme planning is based on  analysis of the facts in a situation</strong><br />
				  It is important to take into account  the conditions that exist at a particular time. This implies that factors such  as land, crops, economic trends, social structure, economic status of the  people, their habits, traditions and culture, in fact, everything about the  area in which the job is to be done and its people, may be considered while  planning an extension programme for an area. These factors may be viewed in terms  of established long-term  objectives and rural policy. The outcome of previous plans should also be  reviewed and results utilized.<br />
				  Brunner and Yang (1949) argue that  there is no greater mistake than to assume that technical know-how  alone will solve the problems of the farmers. They say that no programme or  even technique can achieve the desired results when not in harmony with the  culture of the people. 'Extension knows, if need be, the surer way is to effect  cultural change by the slow but certain process of education'.<br />
				  2.Extension programme planning  selects problems based on people's interests   <br />
				  and   needs<br />
				  Sound programme building selects  problems based on people's needs. I t is necessary to select these problems  which are most urgent and of widest concern. Choice of problems must be from  among those highlighted by an analysis of the facts regarding what are felt as  unfelt needs. To be effective, extension work must begin with the interests of  the families. It must meet interest and use them as a spring-board  for developing further interests. It is common knowledge that people join  together because of mutual interests and needs.<br />
				  Brunner (1945) said that an  extension programme must meet the felt needs of the people. Leagans (1961) has  recommended that the extension workers adopt the subject matter and teaching  procedure to the educational level of the people, to their needs and interests,  and to their resources.<br />
				  3.Extension programme planning  determines definite objectives and solutions which  <br />
				  offer satisfaction<br />
				  In order to hold interest, we must  set working objectives and offer solutions which are within reach and which  will give satisfaction on achievement. This is related to motivation for  action. People must see how they or their communities are going to benefit from  the proposed solutions. Very often the simplicity or dramatic effect of the  practice recommended is the most potent factor in its wide adoption. Further,  if there is to be progress and not more evolution in the development of man,  the objectives must be periodically revised in view of the progress made. In  other words, as changes occur, objectives need to be re determined to allow for  even further progress to be realized.<br />
  <strong>4.Extension programme planning has  permanence with flexibility</strong><br />
				  Any good programme must be forward  looking and permanent. Permanence means anticipating years of related and well  organized effort. Along with this lower process, which both follow and makes a  long-term  trend, experience has shown that particular items will need to be changed to  meet unforeseen contingencies or emergencies. Without flexibility, the  programme may not, in fact, meet the needs of the people. A programme should be  prepared well in advance of its execution but not too far ahead of time. Ordinary  events may subject it to change in part though not in total. It is  obvious that an extension programme must be  kept flexible to meet the changing needs and interests of the people.<br />
  <strong>5.Extension programme planing has balance  with emphasis</strong><br />
				  A good programme should cover the  majority of people's important interests. It must be comprehensive enough to  embrace all groups, creeds and races at all levels and community, block,  state,  national and international  problems. It is futile to deal with only one phase of life in a community as an  end in itself. At the same time, a few of the most important or timely problems  should be chosen for emphasis. To avoid scattered effort, something must stand  out. Decisions must be made as to which of the needs are most urgent. The next  consideration in choosing items for emphasis is to promote efficiency by  permitting a good distribution of time and effort throughout the year. Too many  things carried out simultaneously will divide either the worker's or the  people's attention.<br />
  <strong>II. Planning process</strong><br />
  <strong>6.Extension programme planning has a  definite plan of work</strong><br />
				  No matter how well a programme is  thought through, it is of no use unless carried out. This implies good  organization and careful planning for action. A plan of work is an outline of  procedure so arranged as to enable efficient execution of the entire programme.  It is the answer to what, where, when and how the job will be done. In carrying  out programme plans, different leaders and groups may work on various phases,  i.e., the women in the community may work on one segment, the men on a second  segment and youth-club  members on a third. Organization should be used as a tool to accomplish these  purposes, never as an end in itself.<br />
  <strong>7.Extension programme planning is an  educational process</strong><br />
				  The people who do the planning may  participate in local surveys and neighbourhood observations. This provides an  opportunity for them to learn more about their own community and area and  increases their interest. The extension worker has the responsibilities of  providing local leaders with the knowledge, skills and attitudes they must have  if they are to help in educationally serving the people. Essentially, learning  takes place through the experiences the learner has and the responses he makes to  the stimuli of his environment. The experience gained in finding facts,  analyzing situations, recognizing problems, stating objectives and thinking of  possible solutions and alternatives should make for a better and more effective  learning environment. The extension personnel should remember this fact and  provide opportunities for the effective participation of local people in  programme planning.<br />
  <strong>8. Extension programme planning is a  continuous process</strong><br />
				  Since  programme planning is viewed as an educational process and since education is  seen as a continuous process, therefore it logically holds that extension  programme planning is a continuous process. There is no question of exhausting  new knowledge, either in the subject matter with which we deal or in the  methods of teaching. With the constant flux of agricultural technology,  extension education is faced with an increasingly more difficult job as it  tries to serve the needs and interests of the people. Sutton (1961) said that  extension in a changing society must adjust and plan for the future to serve  the needs of people. He set forth five steps within might be useful in making  necessary adjustments:<br />
				  i.          Keep choice to the people<br />
				  ii.         Be flexible and ready to grasp with  firmness new problems as they arise.<br />
				  iii.        Work with people in seeking practical  solutions to their problems.<br />
				  iv.        Keep abreast of technological and social  change.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Close the gap between research discovery and practical  application.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">            It is obvious that tomorrow's  problem will not be the same as today's. So extension must make periodic  adjustments in its plans to meet the changing problems. Extension must also be  alert to the change that is going on in Science and Technology. With new  technology, solutions to problems change. It is therefore necessary to view  extension programme planning as a continuous process though its recurrence is  cyclic.<br />
                    <strong>9.Extension programme planning is a co</strong><strong>-ordinating process</strong><br />
				  Extension programme planning finds  the most important problems and seeks agreement on definite objectives. It  coordinates the efforts of all interested leaders, groups and agencies and  considers the use of resources. It obtains the interest and co-operation  of many people by showing them why things need to be done. This is important in  working with people. Within the extension organization, the block staff may  work together on an integrated programme, each member devoting part of his  energy to appropriate phases.<br />
  <strong>10.Extension programme planning involves  local people and their institutions</strong><br />
				  Involvement of local people and  their institutions is very essential for the success of any programme for their  development. People become interested and give better support to the programme  when they are involved in the planning process. So, extension programmes should  be planned with the people and not for them.<br />
  <strong>11.Extension programme planning provides  for evaluation of results</strong><br />
				  Since extension programme planning  involves decision-making  procedures, so evaluation is important in order to make intelligent decisions  aimed at achieving the stated objectives. Matthews (1962) pointed out that  extension progarmme planning and evaluation go together. Kelsey and Hearne  (1949) have said that all other principles of programme building are related to  evaluation.<br />
				  Effective evaluation will, of  course, depend on clear objectives, knowing which people we are trying to teach  and having records of the results in terms that reflect changes in their  action. Starting a programme with the intention of engaging in a careful  evaluation at the close of a specific period has a salutary effect on all the  intermediate processes. However, provision has to be made both for concurrent  and ex-post  facto types of evaluation.</p>

				<h4 align="justify">EXTENSION PROGRAMME PLANNING  MODEL</h4>

  <strong>Organisation for Planning</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  concept of involving potential clientele in the planning of extension  programmes has received widespread acceptance. Involvement of people in making  decisions about educational objectives not only results in better decisions  about educational objectives, but also speeds up the process of educational  change. By participating in the analysis of the local situation, the people's  representatives are better informed and are better prepared for positive  action.<br />
				  <br />
				  The following conditions should be  met in order to ensure that a good organisation has been set up<br />
				  1. All social systems and special interest groups are  identified.<br />
				  2. Members of  the planning committee represent all major interest groups, various economic  and social levels of people, major vocations of the locality and other  important elements in the area.<br />
				  3. Each member of the planning committee clearly understands<br />
				  a) the  purpose of the group;<br />
				  b) how the  group should function in attaining its purpose; and <br />
				  c) his  individual role as a member.<br />
				  4. Members of the planning committee have been elected,  nominated or co-opted by appropriate democratic procedures.<br />
  <strong>I. Planning process</strong><br />
  <strong>1.         Reaching understanding regarding  principles, procedures, roles and time schedule</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>It  is necessary that all staff and the people's representatives are familiar with  the principles and procedures of programme planning for the purposes of clarity  and uniformity of action.<br />
				  The following conditions should be  met in order in fulfil the spirit of this step:<br />
				  i).        A clearly  defined statement of purpose and roles of each member is given by the planning  committee.<br />
				  ii).        The block,  district and state level extension workers and programme planning committee  members have understood :<br />
				  a)         the roles of  extension workers in programme planning;<br />
				  b)         the role of  programme planning committee members;<br />
				  c)         the purpose  of programme planning;<br />
				  d)         the scope of  extension's educational responsibilities;<br />
				  e)         the  procedures to be followed;<br />
				  f)         the  principles to be kept in view; and <br />
				  g)         the time  schedule to be followed.<br />
  <strong>2. Analyse situation</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Situation  analysis involves collection, analysis and interpretation of the existing  facts. Good planning depends on the availability of adequate and reliable data  and scientific elaboration and interpretation of the same.<br />
				  The following criteria should be met  in order to ensure that this step has been adequately followed.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Facts needed to evaluate the accomplishment of the  previous year's programme are collected.</li>
				    <li>Local facts needed to define correct and projected  needs and interests and problems of the area are assembled</li>
				    <li>The basic facts assembled and collected about  background information are analysed and interpreted. </li>
				    <li>The major needs and problems of the area, which are  within the scope of extension’s educational responsibility, are identified.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>3. Determine objectives</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>It  is essential in the programme planning process that before deciding on the  projects to be undertaken, basic objectives of the programme are determined by  the villagers in consultation with the extension staff.<br />
				  The following conditions or  qualities will exist when objectives have been determined adequately and  properly</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Objectives have been determined relating to major  problems, need and/or interests as determined by the programme planning  committee.</li>
				    <li>Both immediate and long-term objectives have been  determined.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>4. Select problems with due regard to  priorities </strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Selection  of problems to be tackled will involve identification, classification and  selection with due regard to priorities. Identification of problems will be  done on the basis of situation analysis. Once the problems have been  identified, it is desirable that they be properly classified into the following  categories:</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Problems which can be solved by the people themselves  with no outside financial aid.</li>
				    <li>Problems which can be solved by the people with the aid  of the Panchayat Samiti</li>
				    <li>Problems which can only be solved with the help of  Government funds</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">            The following conditions will exist  when the requirements of this step have been adequately met:</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Of the identified problems, the most felt and of widest  concern are selected by the extension agents and people's representatives.</li>
				    <li>Selected problems are related to the family, community  block and situation.</li>
				    <li>For tackling the selected problems, the time is  scheduled on greatest priority basis</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>5.   Find solutions to problems</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>The  Village Level Workers at the village level and the concerned Extension Officer  at the block level are two most important functionaries who advise the village  families and the village institutions regarding solutions to their problems.  The other Extension officials at various levels may join with the team in  finding solutions to problems. Experiences of the farmers and suggestions of  the specialists will help in arriving at a joint decision.<br />
				  The following conditions will exist  when this step has been properly carried out</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>All the available research findings in the State are  collected and projected.</li>
				    <li>Block level and district level specialists make  suitable solution to the problems according to the research findings.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>II. Planned Programme</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>As  Leagans (1961) pointed out, it is of utmost importance that the staff and the  people in each area not only develop an extension programme, but also prepare  the programme in a written form that is readily understood and is suitable for  obtaining approval and use as a guide for officials and non-officials. <br />
				  The problems  should be stated from the viewpoint of the farm, the home and the community.  They should not be stated in terms of solutions. The objectives should also be  stated at a lower level in specific and measurable terms. They should include  details about the learners to be reached subject matter to be taught and the  behavioral changes to be effected. The objectives may also be stated from the  point of view of the extension organisations and the extension public.<br />
				  The following conditions will be met  in order to have a good programme statement :</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>The written programme should be suitable for use by the  staff, planning groups and other individuals or groups concerned with the  programme.</li>
				    <li>It should clearly state the important problems or needs  identified by the staff and the people in the programming process.</li>
				    <li>It should specify the subject mater related to each  objective that is highly significant to the people, socially or economically or  both.</li>
				    <li>It should be used as the basis for developing annual  plans of work.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>III. Plan of Work</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Preparing  a plan of activities directed towards solving selected problems is an important  step. A plan of work is the listing of activities by which the objectives  already decided upon are to be achieved.<br />
				  The following conditions should  exist in a good plan</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>The plan of work is in written form.</li>
				    <li>It has been developed co-operatively by the extension  workers and people's representatives.</li>

				    <li>The plan indicates for each educational job.</li>
				    <ul>
				      <li>How it will be done</li>
				      <li>When it will be done</li>

			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>3. Carry out the plan of work</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>The  approved programme should be carried out, step by step, according to the plan  of work and in a co-ordinated manner. The success of a programme depends on the  methods used to implement it.<br />
				  It should be ensured that -</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>the plans for coordination including calendar of  activities within and outside extension agency system</li>
				    <li>the techniques, methods and materials vary appropriate  to the situation and clientele</li>

				    <li>the plans for shared responsibilities were followed.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>V. Evaluation of Accomplishments</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Concurrent  and <strong><em>ex-post</em> <em>facto</em></strong> review of progress towards  the objectives is an essential phase of extension programme planning. This  keeps the extension agency on the right track and helps in differentiating  means from ends. Evaluation of the activities should be undertaken jointly by  the extension staff and the people's representative organisations at different  levels.<br />
				  Conditions  that will exist when this guideline is met are as under</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Evaluation plans were developed for each of the phases  of the programme to be evaluated as indicated in the annual plan of work.</li>
				    <li>A report of accomplishments and implications was made  to the extension governing group. The governing group in projecting their plans  for extension activities gave the findings from the report of accomplishments  and implications.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong> Extension Evaluation</strong><br />
				  Extension programmes are mostly  funded with public money and are planned and implemented by an organization,  which in most cases is a department of a government. In order to justify the  appropriation of public funds and continuing support from the people, it is  necessary that their management as well as impact be properly and adequately  evaluated from time to time. How, to evaluate management, achievements and  failures of these programmes has been a challenge to extension workers right  from the time when planned extension programmes were introduced. However, 'it  was when Tyler's (1950) philosophy of educational evaluation became a part of  extension education that educational evaluation became a part of extension  education that the pattern of extension educational evaluation took a more  usable, understandable form' (Sabrosky, 1966).<br />
				  The word 'evaluation' has its origin  in the Latin word &quot;valere&quot; meaning to be strong or valiant. Its  dictionary meanings are the determination of the value, the strength or worth  of something, an appraisal, an estimates of the force of or making a judgement  of something.<br />
				  <strong>Evaluation </strong>as applied to the field of extension education, may be defined as &quot;a  process of systematic appraisal by which we determine the value, worth or  meaning of an activity or an enterprise&quot;. It is a method for determining  how far an activity has progressed and how much further it should be carried to  accomplish objectives'. Thus to an extension worker evaluation means  determining the results of his extension programmes in order to know the extent  to which objectives have been achieved and why and what changes would be needed  in case the programme is planned again, or in its implementation.<br />
				  Tyler (1950) developed two basic notions  regarding educational evaluation, which equally apply to extension evaluation.  These notions are that the process of evaluation (i) is essentially a process  of determining behaviour of the people covered under the programme and (ii) the  process of determining the degree to which these behavioural changes are  actually taking place. Thus extension evaluation may be said to be a process  for determining behavioural changes of people resulting from extension  programmes. Once evaluation became an integral part of the extension education  process, extension managers started applying this process to evaluate programme  planning, management and implementation aspects of extension programme.</p>
				<h2 align="justify">Definitions of evaluation</h2>
				<p align="justify">            More specific definitions of  evaluation are given by persons involved in rural development programmes. While  most of these definitions refer specifically to the assessment of the results  of programmes of extension education, they can also be applied to the training  aspect of such programmes. Some definitions of evaluation are:</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <ul>
				      <li>It is a process, which enables the administrator to  describe the effects of his programme and thereby make progressive adjustments  in order to reach his goal more effectively (Jahoda and Barnit, 1955).</li>
				      <li>Programme evaluation is the determination of the extent  to which the desired objectives have been attained or the amount of movement  that has been made in the desired direction (Boyle and Johns, 1970).</li>
				      <li>Programme evaluation is the process of judging the  worth or value of a programme. The judgement is formed by comparing the  programme should be (Steele, 1970).</li>
				      <li>Evaluation is the process of delineating, obtaining and  providing useful information for judging decision alternative (Stufflebeam,  1971).</li>
				      <li>Evaluation is a co-ordinated process carried  on by the total system and its individual subsystem. It consists of making  judgements about a planned programme based on established criteria and known,  observable evidence (Boone, 1985).</li>
			        </ul>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Nature of evaluation</strong><br />
                    <strong>1.Evaluation is not measurement:</strong> Evaluation is an integral part of extension education. All aspects of extension  work need evaluation. Evaluation does not mean mere measuring of achievements,  which is usually done after the programme is executed. Extension being an  educational process, it is necessary to evaluate management of the programme  and methods used, achievements accomplished in line with the objectives and  also to determine the reasons for success or failure.<br />
                    <strong>2.Evaluation is not exactly scientific  research:</strong> When we think of evaluation as a process of collecting  information as a basis for making decisions, forming judgements and drawing  conclusions, we realise it has much in common with scientific research. But  there is a great difference between our casual everyday evaluation and  scientific research. However, the difference is a matter of degree rather than  kind. Casual everyday evaluation can be placed at one end of the scale and  scientific research at the other end. There are five locations on the scale  with no sharp lines of distinction, i.e., casual everyday evaluation, self-checking  evaluation, do-it  yourself evaluation, extension evaluation studies and scientific research.</p>

				<p align="justify"><img src="untitled.jpg" alt="a" width="637" height="188" /></p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Types of evaluation</strong></p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <ul>
				      <li>Self-evaluation: This is to be carried out by every worker as  a matter of routine. This requires the self-critical attitude which is  so essential for extension work. By this self-critical attitude, the  chances of an extension worker growing and continuously improving his  professional competency become greater.</li>
				      <li>Internal evaluation: Evaluation carried to by the  agency responsible for the planning and implementation of the programme. Some  of the other methods for internal evaluation are: systematic use of diaries and  reports of workers, planned visits of staff members to work spot, use of  special questionnaires and proforma for observation and inquiry etc.</li>
				      <li>External evaluation: Evaluation conducted by a person  or a committee outside the area of operation. One of the strong features of the  Indian Community Development Programme is that simultaneous with its start an  independent agency, namely the Programme Evaluation Organization, was  established.</li>
			        </ul>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">            Evaluation can also be classified  into (i) concurrent and (ii) ex-post facto evaluation.</p>
				<h2 align="justify">Evaluate programme planning</h2>
				<p align="justify">            As a result of experience, theory,  research and experimentation, much information has been accumulated about how  an extension programme should be planned. Progress in science and technology  and the broadening of extension's clientele with the accompanying great  variation in needs and interests have made the scientific planning of extension  education programmes  more important than  ever before. There is considerable agreement on certain criteria which, if  followed, make for successful extension programme planning at different levels.  These criteria represent the ideal with which to compare our practices and  procedures or programme planning. Some of the steps needed top evaluate or  programming function in view of these criteria include:<br />
				  i.          Identify the evidence needed to form a  judgement about each criterion.<br />
				  ii.         Specify the  methods that will be used to obtain the evidence, such as personal observation,  personal interview or through a systematic survey.<br />
				  iii.        On the basis  of the evidence gathered, judge whether or not each criterion is being  adequately satisfied in the programme planning activities.<br />
				  <strong></strong><br />
  <strong>Extension evaluation process</strong><br />
				  There are several models of  evaluation available in the literature. However, a very simplified version of  most of these models may be quite workable for evaluating extension programmes  since, as Bhatnagar (1987) has pointed out, any extension evaluation process  has to be based on certain assumptions. For example, if some inputs are provided  in the form of a programme, specific outputs can be expected and if these  outputs happen, then the purpose of the programme can be achieved; if the  purpose is achieved, then the development goal is realised. This means that  evaluation has to be so designed that the quality types and adequacy of the  input measures, outputs and their impact in achieving the programme objectives  have to be evaluated systematically. <br />
  <strong>Steps involved in an extension programme  evaluative process may be as follows:</strong><br />
  <strong>i) Formulate evaluation objectives</strong><br />
				  Specific objectives to be achieved  through the evaluative process must be clearly and adequately identified and  started. All further efforts should be knit around these objectives.<br />
  <strong>ii) Classify programme objectives</strong><br />
				  It is assumed that each extension  programme, when formulated and implemented, will have specific well-defined  objectives. Since evaluation is basically a process of determining the extent  to which various extension teaching activities were organized and managed and  the extent to which they contributed to achieving the goals, programme  objectives must be clearly understood and if necessary, further broke down into  measurable terms. This is a crucial step as all further efforts will be  directed towards collecting evidence related to these objectives.<br />
  <strong>iii) Identify indicators</strong><br />
				  To identify indicators or the kind  of evidence necessary to evaluate achievement in relation to specified  programme objectives, it is necessary that specific beneficiaries of the  programme be identified, the kind of behavioural changes expected in them be  clearly stated, and the kin of learning experiences expected to be provided to  them spelled out, together with the level of management to be achieved for  provided those learning experiences are specified. Once this is done,  identification of specific indicators to measures the achievements will not be  difficult.<br />
  <strong>iv) Decide the kind of information needed</strong><br />
				  Once the indicators for evaluating  the management and performance of a programme have been indicated, specific  information to be collected may be worked out. Since there is usually more  information than an extension worker can collect, he has to be very  discriminating about the kind and amount of information that should be  collected. Timing for collection of information may also need to be specified.<br />
  <strong>v) Sampling</strong><br />
				  The purpose of sampling is to take a  relatively small number of units from a population in such a way that the  evidence collected from them becomes representative evidence of the entire  population. Although there are several sampling methods, perhaps stratified  sampling procedures may be most suitable for extension evaluation studies a  they allow inclusion of all interested groups and ensure enough heterogeneity  in the sample.<br />
  <strong>vi) Decide the design of evaluation</strong><br />
				  An ideal design of evaluation may be  an experimental one. This would allow separating the effect of the programme  from other factors, by setting control and treatment groups. Several  experimental designs, such as one-group pre-test-post-test design, static groups comparison, pre-test,  post-test  control group design, Solomon four-group design, longitudinal study design, etc. are  available in literature and can be used. However, in actual practice, extension  progammes are seldom run in a way that allows an experimental design of  evaluation. In Pilot Projects, it might be possible to use an experimental  design of evaluation. By and large, a survey method is use. This method can be  used for evaluating ongoing progress or as an ex-post facto evaluation of  the programme after it has completed its tenure.<br />
  <strong>vii) Collection and analysis of evaluation  evidence</strong><br />
				  There are many methods for  collecting information for evaluative purposes, such as the mail questionnaire,  personal interview, distributed questionnaires, group interviews, case studies,  systematic field observations, systematic study of secondary data etc.  Selection of the right kind of data collection method will depend on the  objectives of the evaluation, kind of information needed, time and resources  available and the type of respondents from whom information is to be collected.<br />
				  However, whatever the method used, a  specific questionnaire or interview schedule or data recording sheet must be  developed with care.
				  Once the data is collected, it must  be tabulated, summarized and analyzed with adequate care. This step should not  be rushed. To avoid delay, however, analysis may be done with the help of a  computer.<br />
  <strong>viii)      Interpretation  of the results in a proper way </strong><br />
				  It is a very crucial as evaluation  results can be missed also. Once tentative generalizations are arrived at, it  may be appropriate and they are informally discussed among the interpreters as  well as with programme planning and implementation officials, so that the  results of evaluation are put in a proper perspective.
				  The evaluation results must clearly  state the achievements, failures and future adjustments needed. A written  report of the evaluation findings should be prepared and made available to all  concerned.</p>
