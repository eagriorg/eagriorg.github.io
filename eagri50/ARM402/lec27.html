				<p>1. Agriculture is a way  of life, a tradition, which, for centuries, has shaped thethought, the outlook,  the culture and the economic life of the people of India. Agriculture,  therefore, is and will continue to be central to all strategies for planned  socio-economic development of the country. Rapid growth of agriculture is  essential not only to achieve self-reliance at national level but also for  household food security and to bring about equity in distribution of income and  wealth resulting in rapid reduction in poverty levels. <br />
2. Indian agriculture  has, since Independence, made rapid strides. In taking the annual foodgrains  production from 51 million tonnes of the early fifties to 206 million tonnes at  the turn of the century, it has contributed significantly in achieving self  sufficiency in food and in avoiding food shortages in our country. The pattern  of growth of agriculture has, however, brought in its wake, uneven development,  across regions and crops as also across different sections of farming community  and is characterized by low levels of productivity and degradation of natural  resources in some areas. Capital inadequacy, lack of infrastructural support  and demand side constraints such as controls on movement, storage and sale of  agricultural products, etc., have continued to affect the economic viability of  agriculture sector. Consequently, the growth of agriculture has also tended to  slacken during the nineties.<br />
3. Agriculture has also  become a relatively unrewarding profession due to generally unfavourable price  regime and low value addition, causing abandoning of farming and increasing  migration from rural areas. The situation is likely to be exacerbated further  in the wake of integration of agricultural trade in the global system, unless  immediate corrective measures are taken.<br />
4. Over 200 million  Indian farmers and farm workers have been the backbone of India's agriculture.  Despite having achieved national food security the well being of the farming  community continues to be a matter of grave concern for the planners and policy  makers in the country. The establishment of an agrarian economy which ensures  food and nutrition to India's billion people, raw materials for its expanding  industrial base and surpluses for exports, and a fair and equitable reward  system for the farming community for the services they provide to the society,  will be the mainstay of reforms in the agriculture sector. <br />
5. The National Policy on  Agriculture seeks to actualise the vast untapped growth potential of Indian  agriculture, strengthen rural infrastructure to support faster agricultural  development, promote value addition, accelerate the growth of agro business,  create employment in rural areas, secure a fair standard of living for the  farmers and agricultural workers and their families, discourage migration to  urban areas and face the challenges arising out of economic liberalization and  globalisation. Over the next two decades, it aims to attain:<br />
· A growth rate in excess  of 4 per cent per annum in the agriculture sector <br />
· Growth that is based on  efficient use of resources and conserves our soil, water and bio-diversity; <br />
· Growth with equity,  i.e., growth which is widespread across regions and farmers; <br />
· Growth that is demand  driven and caters to domestic markets and maximises benefits from exports of  agricultural products in the face of the challenges arising from economic  liberalization and globalisation; <br />
· Growth that is  sustainable technologically, environmentally and economically. <br />
<strong>Sustainable  Agriculture</strong> <br />
6. The policy will seek  to promote technically sound, economically viable, environmentally  non-degrading, and socially acceptable use of country's natural resources -  land, water and genetic endowment to promote sustainable development of  agriculture. Measures will be taken to contain biotic pressures on land and to  control indiscriminate diversion of agricultural lands for non-agricultural  purposes. The unutilized wastelands will be put to use for agriculture and  afforestation. Particular attention will be given for increasing cropping  intensity through multiple-cropping and inter-cropping. <br />
7. The Government accords  abiding importance to improving the quality of the country's land and soil  resources. Reclamation of degraded and fallow lands as well as problem soils  will be given high priority to optimize their productive use. Special emphasis  will be laid on conserving soils and enriching their fertility. Management of  land resources on watershed basis will receive special attention. Areas of  shifting cultivation will also receive particular attention for their  sustainable development. Integrated and holistic development of rainfed areas  will be promoted by conservation of rain water by vegetative measures on  watershed basis and augmentation of biomass production through agro and farm  forestry with the involvement of the watershed community. All spatial  components of a watershed, i.e. arable land, non-arable and drainage lines will  be treated as one geo-hydrological entity. Management of grazing land will  receive greater attention for augmenting availability of animal feed and  fodder. A long-term perspective plan for sustainable rainfed agriculture  through watershed approach will be vigorously pursued for development of two thirds  of India's cropped area which is dependent on rains.<br />
8. Rational utilization  and conservation of the country's abundant water resources will be promoted.  Conjunctive use of surface and ground water will receive highest priority.  Special attention will be focused on water quality and the problem of receding  ground-water levels in certain areas as a result of over-exploitation of  underground aquifers. Proper on-farm management of water resources for the  optimum use of irrigation potential will be promoted. Use of <em>in situ</em> moisture management techniques such as mulching and use of micro overhead  pressured irrigation systems like drip and sprinkler and green house technology  will be encouraged for greater water use efficiency and improving productivity,  particularly of horticultural crops. Emphasis will be placed on promotion of  water harvesting structures and suitable water conveyance systems in the hilly  and high rainfall areas for rectification of regional imbalances. Participatory  community irrigation management will be encouraged.<br />
9. Erosion and narrowing  of the base of India's plant and animal genetic resources in the last few  decades has been affecting the food security of the country. Survey and  evaluation of genetic resources and safe conservation of both indigenous and  exogenously introduced genetic variability in crop plants, animals and their  wild relatives will receive particular attention. The use of bio-technologies  will be promoted for evolving plants which consume less water, are drought resistant,  pest resistant, contain more nutrition, give higher yields and are  environmentally safe. Conservation of bio-resources through their <em>ex situ</em> preservation in Gene Banks, as also <em>in situ </em>conservation in their  natural habitats through bio-diversity parks, etc., will receive a high  priority to prevent their extinction. Specific measures will also be taken to  conserve indigenous breeds facing extinction. There will be a time bound  programme to list, catalogue and classify country's vast agro bio-diversity. <br />
10. Sensitization of the  farming community with the environmental concerns will receive high priority.  Balanced and conjunctive use of bio-mass, organic and inorganic fertilizers and  controlled use of agro chemicals through integrated nutrients and pest  management (INM &amp; IPM) will be promoted to achieve the sustainable  increases in agricultural production. A nation-wide programme for utilization  of rural and urban garbage, farm residues and organic waste for organic matter  repletion and pollution control will be worked out.<br />
11. Agro forestry and  social forestry are prime requisites for maintenance of ecological balance and  augmentation of bio-mass production in the agricultural systems. Agro-forestry  will receive a major thrust for efficient nutrient cycling, nitrogen fixation,  organic matter addition and for improving drainage. Farmers will be encouraged  to take up farm/agro-forestry for higher income generation by evolving  technology, extension and credit support packages and removing constraints to  development of agro and farm forestry. Involvement of farmers and landless  labourers will be sought in the development of pastures/forestry programmes on  public wastelands by giving financial incentives and entitlements to the  usufructs of trees and pastures.<br />
12. The history and  traditional knowledge of agriculture, particularly of tribal communities,  relating to organic farming and preservation and processing of food for  nutritional and medicinal purposes is one of the oldest in the world. Concerted  efforts will be made to pool, distill and evaluate traditional practices,  knowledge and wisdom and to harness them for sustainable agricultural growth.<br />
<strong>Food and Nutritional  Security </strong> <br />
13. Special efforts will  be made to raise the productivity and production of crops to meet the  increasing demand for food generated by unabated demographic pressures and raw  materials for expanding agro-based industries. A regionally differentiated  strategy will be pursued, taking into account the agronomic, climatic and  environmental conditions to realize the full growth potential of every region.  Special attention will be given to development of new crop varieties,  particularly of food crops, with higher nutritional value through adoption of  bio-technology particularly, genetic modification, while addressing bio-safety  concerns.<br />
14. A major thrust will  be given to development of rainfed and irrigated horticulture, floriculture,  roots and tubers, plantation crops, aromatic and medicinal plants, bee-keeping  and sericulture, for augmenting food supply, exports and generating employment  in the rural areas. Availability of hybrid seeds and disease-free planting  materials of improved varieties, supported by network of regional nurseries,  tissue culture laboratories, seed farms will be promoted to support systematic  development of horticulture having emphasis on increased production,  post-harvest management, precision farming, bio-control of pests and quality  regulation mechanism and exports. <br />
15. Animal husbandry and  fisheries also generate wealth and employment in the agriculture sector.  Development of animal husbandry, poultry, dairying and aqua-culture will  receive a high priority in the efforts for diversifying agriculture, increasing  animal protein availability in the food basket and for generating exportable  surpluses. A national livestock breeding strategy will be evolved to meet the  requirements of milk, meat, egg and livestock products and to enhance the role  of draught animals as a source of energy for farming operations and transport.  Major thrust will be on genetic upgradation of indigenous/native cattle and  buffaloes using proven semen and high quality pedigreed bulls and by expanding  artificial insemination network to provide services at the farmer's doorstep. <br />
16. Generation and dissemination  of appropriate technologies in the field of animal production as also health  care to enhance production and productivity levels will be given greater  attention. Cultivation of fodder crops and fodder trees will be encouraged to  meet the feed and fodder requirements and to improve animal nutrition and  welfare. Priority attention will also be given to improve the processing,  marketing and transport facilities, with emphasis on modernization of  abattoirs, carcass utilization and value addition thereon. Since animal disease  eradication and quarantine is critical to exports, animal health system will be  strengthened and disease free zones created. The involvement of cooperatives  and the private sector will be encouraged for development of animal husbandry,  poultry and dairy. Incentives for livestock and fisheries production activities  will be brought at par with incentives for crop production.<br />
17. An integrated  approach to marine and inland fisheries, designed to promote sustainable  aquaculture practices, will be adopted. Biotechnological application in the  field of genetics and breeding, harmonal applications immunology and disease  control will receive particular attention for increased aquaculture production.  Development of sustainable technologies for fin and shell fish culture as also  pearl-culture, their yield optimization, harvest and post-harvest operations,  mechanization of fishing boats, strengthening of infrastructure for production  of fish seed, berthing and landing facilities for fishing vessels and  development of marketing infrastructure will be accorded high priority. Deep  sea fishing industry will be developed to take advantage of the vast potential  of country's exclusive economic zone. <br />
<strong>Generation and  Transfer of Technology</strong> <br />
18. A very high priority  will be accorded to evolving new location-specific and economically viable  improved varieties of agricultural and horticultural crops, livestock species  and aquaculture as also conservation and judicious use of germplasm and other  biodiversity resources. The regionalization of agricultural research, based on  identified agro-climatic zones, will be accorded high priority. Application of  frontier sciences like bio-technology, remote sensing technologies, pre and  post-harvest technologies, energy saving technologies, technology for  environmental protection through national research system as well as  proprietary research will be encouraged. The endeavour will be to build a well  organized, efficient and result-oriented agriculture research and education system  to introduce technological change in Indian agriculture. Upgradation of  agricultural education and its orientation towards uniformity in education  standards, women empowerment, user-orientation, vocationalization and promotion  of excellence will be the hallmark of the new policy..<br />
19. The research and  extension linkages will be strengthened to improve quality and effectiveness of  research and extension system. The extension system will be broad based and  revitalized. Innovative and decentralized institutional changes will be  introduced to make the extension system farmer-responsible and  farmer-accountable. Role of Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), Non-Governmental  Organizations (NGOs), Farmers Organizations, Cooperatives, corporate sector and  para-technicians in agricultural extension will be encouraged for organizing  demand driven production systems. Development of human resources through  capacity building and skill upgradation of public extension functionaries and  other extension functionaries will be accorded a high priority. The Government  will endeavour to move towards a regime of financial sustainability of  extension services through affecting in a phased manner, a more realistic cost  recovery of extension services and inputs, while simultaneously safeguarding  the interests of the poor and the vulnerable groups. <br />
20. Mainstreaming gender  concerns in agriculture will receive particular attention. Appropriate  structural, functional and institutional measures will be initiated to empower  women and build their capabilities and improve their access to inputs,  technology and other farming resources. <br />
<strong>Inputs Management</strong> <br />
21. Adequate and timely  supply of quality inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, plant protection  chemicals, bio-pesticides, agricultural machinery and credit at reasonable  rates to farmers will be the endeavour of the Government. Soil testing and  quality testing of fertilisers and seeds will be ensured and supply of spurious  inputs will be checked. Balanced and optimum use of fertilizers will be promoted  together with use of organic manures &amp; bio-fertilizers to optimize the  efficiency of nutrient use. <br />
22. Development,  production and distribution of improved varieties of seeds and planting  materials and strengthening and expansion of seed and plant certification  system with private sector participation will receive a high priority. A  National Seed Grid will be established to ensure supply of seeds especially to  areas affected by natural calamities. The National Seeds Corporation (NSC) and  State Farms Corporation of India (SFCI) will be restructured for efficient  utilization of investment and manpower.<br />
23. Protection to plant  varieties through a <em>sui generis</em> legislation, will be granted to  encourage research and breeding of new varieties particularly in the private  sector in line with India's obligations under TRIPS Agreement. The farmers  will, however, be allowed their traditional rights to save, use, exchange,  share and sell their farm saved seeds except as branded seeds of protected  varieties for commercial purpose. The interests of the researchers will also be  safeguarded in carrying out research on proprietary varieties to develop new  varieties.<br />
24. Integrated pest  management and use of biotic agents in order to minimize the indiscriminate and  injudicious use of chemical pesticides will be the cardinal principle covering  plant protection. Selective and eco-friendly farm mechanization through  appropriate technology will be promoted, with special reference to rainfed  farming to reduce arduous work and to make agriculture efficient and  competitive as also to increase crop productivity.<br />
<strong>Incentives for  Agriculture</strong> <br />
25. The Government will  endeavour to create a favourable economic environment for increasing capital  formation and farmer's own investments by removal of distortions in the  incentive regime for agriculture, improving the terms of trade with  manufacturing sectors and bringing about external and domestic market reforms,  backed by rationalization of domestic tax structure. It will seek to bestow on  the agriculture sector in as many respects as possible benefits similar to  those obtaining in the manufacturing sector, such as easy availability of  credit and other inputs, and infrastructure facilities for development of  agri-business industries and development of effective delivery systems and  freeing movement of agro produce. <br />
26. Consequent upon  dismantling of Quantitative Restrictions on imports as per WTO Agreement on  Agriculture, Commodity-wise strategies and arrangements for protecting the  grower from adverse impact of undue price fluctuations in world markets and for  promoting exports will be formulated. Apart from price competition, other  aspects of marketing such as quality, choice, health and bio-safety will be  promoted. Exports of horticultural produce and marine products will receive  particular emphasis. A two-fold long term strategy of diversification of  agricultural produce and value addition enabling the production system to  respond to external environment and creating export demand for the commodities  produced in the country will be evolved with a view to providing the farmers  incremental income from export earnings. A favourable economic environment and  supportive public management system will be created for promotion of  agricultural exports. Quarantine, both of exports and imports, will be given  particular attention so that Indian agriculture is protected from the ingress  of exotic pests and diseases. <br />
27. In order to protect  the interest of farmers in context of removal of Quantitative Restrictions,  continuous monitoring of international prices will be undertaken and  appropriate tariffs protection will be provided. Import duties on manufactured  commodities used in agriculture will be rationalized. The domestic agricultural  market will be liberalized and all controls and regulations hindering increase  in farmers' income will be reviewed and abolished to ensure that agriculturists  receive prices commensurate with their efforts, investment. Restrictions on the  movement of agricultural commodities throughout the country will be  progressively dismantled.<br />
28. The structure of  taxes on foodgrains and other commercial crops will be reviewed and  rationalized. Similarly, the excise duty on materials such as farm machinery  and implements, fertilizers, etc., used as inputs in agricultural production,  post harvest storage and processing will be reviewed. Appropriate measures will  be adopted to ensure that agriculturists by and large remain outside the  regulatory and tax collection systems. Farmers will be exempted from payment of  capital gains tax on compulsory acquisition of agricultural land.<br />
<strong>Investments in  Agriculture</strong> <br />
29. The Agriculture  sector has been starved of capital. There has been a decline in the public  sector investment in the agriculture sector. Public investment for narrowing  regional imbalances, accelerating development of supportive infrastructure for  agriculture and rural development particularly rural connectivity will be  stepped up. A time-bound strategy for rationalisation and transparent pricing  of inputs will be formulated to encourage judicious input use and to generate  resources for agriculture. Input subsidy reforms will be pursued as a  combination of price and institutional reforms to cut down costs of these  inputs for agriculture. Resource allocation regime will be reviewed with a view  to rechannelizing the available resources from support measures towards asset  formation in rural sector.<br />
30. A conducive climate  will be created through a favourable price and trade regime to promote farmers'  own investments as also investments by industries producing inputs for  agriculture and agro based industries. Private sector investments in  agriculture will also be encouraged more particularly in areas like  agricultural research, human resource development, post-harvest management and  marketing.<br />
31. Rural electrification  will be given a high priority as a prime mover for agricultural development.  The quality and availability of electricity supply will be improved and the  demand of the agriculture sector will be met adequately in a reliable and cost  effective manner. The use of new and renewable sources of energy for irrigation  and other agricultural purposes will also be encouraged. <br />
32. Bridging the gap  between irrigation potential created and utilized, completion of all on-going  projects, restoration and modernization of irrigation infrastructure including  drainage, evolving and implementing an integrated plan of augmentation and  management of national water resources will receive special attention for  augmenting the availability and use of irrigation water.<br />
33. Emphasis will be laid  on development of marketing infrastructure and techniques of preservation,  storage and transportation with a view to reducing post-harvest losses and  ensuring a better return to the grower. The weekly periodic markets under the  direct control of panchayat raj institutions will be upgraded and strengthened.  Direct marketing and pledge financing will be promoted. Producers markets on  the lines of Ryatu Bazars will be encouraged through out the width and the  breadth of the country. Storage facilities for different kinds of agricultural  products will be created in the production areas or nearby places particularly  in the rural areas so that the farmers can transport their produce to these  places immediately after harvest in shortest possible time. The establishment  of cold chains, provision of pre cooling facilities to farmers as a service and  cold storage in the terminal markets and improving the retail marketing  arrangements in urban areas will be given priority. Upgradation and  dissemination of market intelligence will receive particular attention.<br />
34. Setting up of  agro-processing units in the producing areas to reduce wastage, especially of  horticultural produce, increased value addition and creation of off-farm  employment in rural areas will be encouraged. Collaboration between the  producer cooperatives and the corporate sector will be encouraged to promote  agro-processing industry. An inter-active coupling between technology, economy,  environment and society will be promoted for speedy development of food and  agro-processing industries and build up a substantial base for production of  value added agro-products for domestic and export markets with a strong  emphasis on food safety and quality. The Small Farmers Agro Business Consortium  (SFAC) will be energized to cater to the needs of farmer entrepreneurs and  promote public and private investments in agri-business.<br />
<strong>Institutional  Structure</strong> <br />
35. Indian agriculture is  characterized by pre-dominance of small and marginal farmers. Institutional  reforms will be so pursued as to channelize their energies for achieving  greater productivity and production. The approach to rural development and land  reforms will focus on the following areas:<br />
· Consolidation of  holdings all over the country on the pattern of north western States. <br />
· Redistribution of  ceiling surplus lands and waste lands among the landless farmers, unemployed  youth with initial start up capital; <br />
· Tenancy reforms to  recognize the rights of the tenants and share croppers; <br />
· Development of lease  markets for increasing the size of the holdings by making legal provisions for  giving private lands on lease for cultivation and agri business; <br />
· Updating and  improvement of land records, computerization and issue of land pass-books to  the farmers; and <br />
· Recognition of women's  rights in land. <br />
36. The rural poor will  be increasingly involved in the implementation of land reforms with the help of  Panchayati Raj Institutions, Voluntary Groups, Social Activists and Community  Leaders.<br />
37. Private sector  participation will be promoted through contract farming and land leasing  arrangements to allow accelerated technology transfer, capital inflow and  assured markets for crop production, especially of oilseeds, cotton and  horticultural crops.<br />
38. Progressive  institutionalization of rural and farm credit will be continued for providing  timely and adequate credit to farmers. The rural credit institutions will be  geared to promote savings, investments and risk management. Particular  attention will be paid to removal of distortions in the priority sector lending  by Commercial Banks for agriculture and rural sectors. Special measures will be  taken for revamping of cooperatives to remove the institutional and financial  weaknesses and evolving simplified procedure for sanction and disbursement of  agriculture credit. The endeavour will be to ensure distribution equity in the  disbursement of credit. Micro-credit will be promoted as an effective tool for alleviating  poverty. Self Help Group - Bank linkage system, suited to Indian rural sector,  will be developed as a supplementary mechanism for bringing the rural poor into  the formal banking system, thereby improving banks outreach and the credit  flows to the poor in an effective and sustainable manner.<br />
39. The basic support to  agriculture has been provided by the cooperative sector assiduously built over  the years. The Government will provide active support for the promotion of  cooperative-form of enterprise and ensure greater autonomy and operational  freedom to them to improve their functioning. The thrust will be on:<br />
· Structural reforms for  promoting greater efficiency and viability by freeing them from excessive  bureaucratic control and political interference; <br />
· Creation of  infrastructure and human resource development; <br />
· Improvement in  financial viability and organizational sustainability of cooperatives; <br />
· Democratisation of  management and increased professionalism in their operations; and <br />
· Creating a viable  inter-face with other grass-root Organizations. <br />
40. The Legislative and  regulatory framework will be appropriately amended and strengthened to achieve  these objectives.</p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Risk management</strong> <br />
				  41. Despite technological  and economic advancements, the condition of farmers continues to be unstable  due to natural calamities and price fluctuations. National Agriculture  Insurance Scheme covering all farmers and all crops throughout the country with  built in provisions for insulating farmers from financial distress caused by  natural disasters and making agriculture financially viable will be made more  farmer specific and effective. Endeavour will be made to provide a package  insurance policy for the farmers, right from sowing of the crops to  post-harvest operations, including market fluctuations in the prices of  agricultural produce.<br />
				  42. In order to reduce  risk in agriculture and impart greater resilience to Indian agriculture against  droughts and floods, efforts will be made for achieving greater flood proofing  of flood prone agriculture and drought proofing of rainfed agriculture for  protecting the farmers from vagaries of nature. For this purpose, contingency  agriculture planning, development of drought and flood resistant crop  varieties, watershed development programmes, drought prone areas and desert  development programmes and rural infrastructure development programmes will  receive particular attention. <br />
				  43. The Central  Government will continue to discharge its responsibility to ensure remunerative  prices for agricultural produce through announcement of Minimum Support Prices  policy for major agricultural commodities. The food, nutrition and other  domestic and exports requirements of the country will be kept in view while  determining the support prices of different commodities. The price structure  and trade mechanism will be continuously reviewed to ensure a favourable  economic environment for the agriculture sector and to bring about an equitable  balance between the rural and the urban incomes. The methodology used by the  Commission on Agricultural Costs &amp; Prices (CACP) in arriving at estimates  of costs of production will be periodically reviewed. The price structure of  both inputs and outputs will be monitored to ensure higher returns to the  farmers and bring about cost effectiveness throughout the economy. Domestic  market prices will be closely monitored to prevent distress sales by the  farmers. Public and cooperative agencies undertaking marketing operations will  be strengthened.<br />
				  44. The Government will  enlarge the coverage of futures markets to minimize the wide fluctuations in  commodity prices as also for hedging their risks. The endeavour will be to  cover all important agricultural products under futures trading in course of  time.<br />
  <strong>Management Reforms</strong> <br />
				  45. Effective  implementation of policy initiatives will call for comprehensive reforms in the  management of agriculture by the Central and the State Governments. The Central  Government will supplement/complement the State Governments' efforts through  regionally differentiated Work Plans, comprising crop/area/target group  specific interventions, formulated in an inter-active mode and implemented in a  spirit of partnership with the States. The Central Government will move away  from schematic approach to Macro-Management mode and assume a role of advocacy,  articulation and facilitation to help the States in their efforts towards  achieving accelerated agricultural development. <br />
				  46. The Government will  focus on quality aspects at all stages of farm operations from sowing to  primary processing. The quality of inputs and other support services to farmers  will be improved. Quality consciousness amongst farmers and agro processors  will be created. Grading and standardization of agricultural products will be  promoted for export enhancement. Application of science and technology in  agriculture will be promoted through a regular system of interface between  S&amp;T institutions and the users/potential users, to make the sector globally  competitive.<br />
				  47. The database for the  agriculture sector will be strengthened to ensure greater reliability of  estimates and forecasting which will help in the process of planning and policy  making. Efforts will be made to significantly improve and harness latest remote  sensing and information technology to capture data, collate it, add value and  disseminate it to appropriate destinations for managing the risk and in  accelerating the growth process. The objective will be to engage in a  meaningful continuous dialogue with the external environment in the changing  scenario and to have on-line and real time system of 'Agriculture on line'  capacity to analyze the signals emanating from the farms and the markets for  the benefit of the farmers.<br />
				  48. The Government of  India trust that this Statement of National Agriculture Policy will receive the  fullest support of all sections of the people and lead to sustainable  development of agriculture, create gainful employment on a self sustaining  basis in rural areas, raise standards of living for the farming communities,  preserve environment and serve as a vehicle for building a resurgent national  economy. <br />
