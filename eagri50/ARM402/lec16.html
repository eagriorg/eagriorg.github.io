				<p><strong>Strategy  - what is strategy?</strong><br />
Johnson and Scholes define strategy as follows:<br />
&quot;Strategy  is the <strong><em>direction </em></strong>and <strong><em>scope</em></strong> of an organisation over  the <strong><em>long-term:</em></strong> which achieves <strong><em>advantage</em></strong> for the  organisation through its configuration of <strong><em>resources</em></strong> within a  challenging <strong><em>environment</em></strong>, to meet the needs of <strong><em>markets</em></strong> and to fulfill <strong><em>stakeholder</em></strong> expectations&quot;.<br />
In other words, strategy is about:</p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Where is the business trying to       get to in the long-term (<strong>direction)</strong></li>
				  <li>Which markets should a business       compete in and what kinds of activities are involved in such markets? (<strong>markets</strong>; <strong>scope</strong>)</li>
				  <li>How can the business perform       better than the competition in those markets? (<strong>Advantage</strong>)?</li>
				  <li>What resources (skills, assets,       finance, relationships, technical competence, facilities) are required in       order to be able to compete? (<strong>resources</strong>)?</li>
				  <li>What external environmental       factors affect the businesses' ability to compete? (<strong>environment</strong>)?</li>
				  <li>What are the values and       expectations of those who have power in and around the business? (<strong>stakeholders)</strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Strategy at Different Levels of a Business</strong> <br />
				  Strategies  exist at several levels in any organization - ranging from the overall business  (or group of businesses) through to individuals working in it.<br />
  <strong><em>Corporate  Strategy</em></strong> - is concerned  with the overall purpose and scope of the business to meet stakeholder  expectations. This is a crucial level since it is heavily influenced by  investors in the business and acts to guide strategic decision-making  throughout the business. Corporate strategy is often stated explicitly in a  &quot;mission statement&quot;.<br />
  <strong><em>Business  Unit Strategy </em></strong>- is  concerned more with how a business competes successfully in a particular  market. It concerns strategic decisions about choice of products, meeting needs  of customers, gaining advantage over competitors, exploiting or creating new  opportunities etc.<br />
  <strong><em>Operational Strategy</em></strong> - is concerned with how each part of the business is  organised to deliver the corporate and business-unit level strategic direction.  Operational strategy therefore focuses on issues of resources, processes,  people etc.</p>
				<p><strong>How Strategy is Managed - Strategic Management</strong> <br />
				  In its  broadest sense, strategic management is about taking &quot;strategic  decisions&quot; - decisions that answer the questions above. In practice, a  thorough strategic management process has three main components, shown in the  figure below:<br />
  <img width="370" height="277" src="lec16_clip_image002.jpg" alt="strategy_balls" /> <br />
  <strong>Strategic Analysis</strong> <br />
				  This  is all about the analyzing the strength of businesses' position and  understanding the important external factors that may influence that position.  The process of Strategic Analysis can be assisted by a number of tools,  including:</p>

				<p><strong>Strategic Choice</strong> <br />
				  This  process involves understanding the nature of stakeholder expectations (the  &quot;ground rules&quot;), identifying strategic options, and then evaluating  and selecting strategic options.<br />
  <strong>Strategy Implementation</strong> <br />
				  Often  the hardest part. When a strategy has been analyzed and selected, the task is  then to translate it into organizational action.<br />
  <strong>A global industry</strong> <br />
				  A global industry can be defined as:</p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>An industry in which firms must       compete in all world markets of that product in order to survive </li>
				  <li>An industry in which a firmâ€™s       competitive advantage depends on economies of scale and economies of scope       gained across markets </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Global markets are international markets where products  are largely standardized.<br />
				  Michael Porter argued that industries are either  multi-domestic or global.<br />
  <strong>Global industries:</strong> competition is global. The same firms compete with each  other everywhere.<br />
  <strong>Multi-domestic industries:</strong> firms compete in each national market  independently of other national markets.<br />
				  In general businesses adopt a global strategy in global  markets and a multi-local strategy in multi domestic markets. <br />
  <strong>Global strategy</strong> <br />
				  Companies such as Sony  and Panasonic pursue a global strategy which involves:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Competing  everywhere </li>
			    </ul>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Appreciating that success demands       a presence in almost every part of the world in order to compete       effectively </li>
				  <li>Making the product the same for       each market </li>
				  <li>Centralized control </li>
				  <li>Taking advantage of customer needs       and wants across international borders </li>
				  <li>Locating their value adding       activities where they can achieve the greatest competitive advantage </li>
				  <li>Integrating and co-coordinating       activities across borders </li>
				  <li>A global strategy is effective       when differences between countries are small and competition is global. It       has advantages in terms of </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Economies  of scale<br />
				  Lower costs<br />
				  Co-ordination of activities<br />
				  Faster product development <br />
				  However, many regret the growing standardization across  the world.<br />
  <strong>Multi domestic  strategy</strong> </p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>A multi-domestic strategy involves       products tailored to individual countries<br />
                    Innovation comes from local R&amp;D </li>
				  <li>There is decentralization of       decision making with in the organization </li>
				  <li>One result of decentralization is       local sourcing </li>
				  <li>Responding to local needs is       desirable but there are disadvantages: for example high costs due to       tailored products and duplication across countries </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Comparison of the two strategies</strong> <br />
				  Four drivers determine the extent and nature of  globalization in an industry:<br />
  <strong>(1) Market drivers</strong> </p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Degree of homogeneity of customer       needs </li>
				  <li>Existence of global distribution       networks </li>
				  <li>Transferable marketing </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>(2) Cost  drivers</strong> </p>
				<ul type="square">
                  <li>Potential       for economies of scale </li>
			    </ul>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Transportation cost </li>
				  <li>Product development costs </li>
				  <li>Economies of scope </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>(3) Government drivers</strong> </p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Favor trade policies e.g. market       liberalization </li>
				  <li>Compatible technical standards and       common marketing regulations </li>
				  <li>Privatization </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>.</strong><br />
                    <strong>(4) Competitive drivers</strong> </p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>The greater the strength of the       competitive drivers the greater the tendency for an industry to globalize<br />
			    </li>
			    </ul>
