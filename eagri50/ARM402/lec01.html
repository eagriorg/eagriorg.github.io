				<p><strong>Entrepreneur</strong><br />
The entrepreneur as a person brings in overall change  through, innovation- for the maximum social good. Human values remain sacred  and inspire him to serve society. He has firm belief in social betterment and  he carries out this responsibility with conviction. In this process, he  accelerates personal, economic as well as human- development.<br />
 The entrepreneur  is a visionary and an integrated man with outstanding leadership qualities.  With a desire to excel, he gives top priority to Research and Development. . He  always works for the well being of the society. More importantly  entrepreneurial activities encompass all fields / sectors and foster a spirit  of enterprise for the welfare of mankind.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Urges  of an Entrepreneur </strong><br />
An urge to exercise powers over things and objects  persists among all human beings. The urge may vary in degree from person to  person. This urge is an intrinsic quality of an entrepreneur. Sociologists  consider him as a sensitive energizer in the modernization of societies. <br />
The entrepreneur is a critical factor in the  socio-economic change. He is the key person who envisages new opportunities,  new techniques, new lines of production, new products and coordinates all other  activities. The true entrepreneur is one who is endowed with more than average  capacities in the task of organizing and coordinating the various other factors  of production. He should be a pioneer, a captain of industry. The supply of  such entrepreneurship is however quite limited and enterprise in general  consists of several grades of organizational skill and capability. The more  efficient entrepreneurs receive a surplus reward over and above the managerial  wages and this sum constitutes true profit ascribable to superior talent.<strong> </strong></p>

                <p><strong>New  Concept of Entrepreneur </strong> <br />
                  The term “entrepreneur” has been  defined as one who detects and evaluates a new situation in his environment and  directs the making of such adjustments in the economic systems, as he deems  necessary. He conceives of an industrial enterprise for the purpose, displays  considerable initiative, grit and determination in bringing his project to  fruition, and in this process, performs one or more of the following: </p>
                <ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Perceives opportunities for       profitable investments</li>
                  <li>Explores the prospects of starting       such a manufacturing enterprise</li>
                  <li>Obtains necessary industrial       licenses</li>
                  <li>Arranges initial capital</li>
                  <li>Provides personal guarantees to       the financial institutions</li>
                  <li> Promises to meet the shortfalls in the       capital; and Co </li>
                  <li>Supplies technical know-how. </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Entrepreneurship may be defined in various ways, but the four key  elements involved in it are: </p>
                <ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Innovation</li>
                  <li>Risk-taking</li>
                  <li>Vision, and</li>
                  <li>Organizing skill.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>All the four elements are inter-related and form a  continuous process in business. Entrepreneurial vision encompasses the  relentless pursuit for operational excellence, innovative technology and being  responsive to the needs of the market place.</p>
                <p><strong>Importance  of an Entrepreneur </strong><br />
                  The Entrepreneur is one of the most important inputs in  the economic development of a country or of regions within the country.  Entrepreneurial competence makes all the difference in the rate of economic  growth. In India, State and private entrepreneurship co-exist. The small-scale  industrial sector and business are left completely to private entrepreneurs. It  is in this context that an increasingly important role has been assigned to the  identification and promotion of entrepreneurs for this sector. <br />
                  The need for a broad-based entrepreneurial class in  India arises from the need to speed up the process of activating the factors of  production, leading to a higher rate of economic growth, dispersal of economic  activities, development of backward and tribal areas, creation of employment  opportunities, improvement in the standard of living of the weaker sections of  the society and involvement of all sections of the society in the process of  growth. <br />
                  Several factors go into the making of an entrepreneur.  Individuals who initiate, establish, maintain and expand new enterprises  constitute the entrepreneurial class. The social-political and economic  conditions, the availability of industrial technology and know how, state of  art and culture of business and trading, existence of markets for products and  services and the incentives and facilities available for starting an industry  or business, all have a bearing on the growth of entrepreneurship. A conducive  environment is created through the policies and interest of the government in  economic and industrial development. </p>
