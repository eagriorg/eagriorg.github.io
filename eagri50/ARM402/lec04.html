				<p><strong>Introduction</strong> <br />
Entrepreneurs  and professional managers are the two sides of the coin. Their individual  itineraries will make the difference between success and failure for the  enterprise. <br />
An  effective entrepreneurial strategy should be an integral part of an  enterprise’s competitive positioning. The progressive develop­ment in the size  of business and the separation of ownership and management in enterprises has  made management a distinct profession. Although both strive to achieve the  similar goals they are said to distinguish themselves in varied measures. </p>
				<p>According to the Sachar Committee on Company Law “A professional  manager is an individual who <br />
				  i.    belongs to the  profession of law, accountancy, medicine, engineering or architecture, or <br />
				  ii.   is a member of a  recognised professional body or institutional body exercising supervisory  jurisdiction over its members, or <br />
				  iii.  is a holder of a degree  or diploma in management from any recognised university and possesses not less  than five years experience in an executive capacity in a company, corporation  or in the government”; or possesses minimum of ten years’ experience in the  same capacity and in the same institutions mentioned in the third category. </p>
				<p>A professional  manager is one who specializes in the work of planning, organizing, leading and  controlling the efforts of others by the systematic used of classified  knowledge and principles. He subscribes to the standards of practice and code  of ethics established by a recognized body. To be a professional manager he  should </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>have an insight of his job requirements; </li>
				  <li>carry out continuous updating of his learning to fulfill his job  requirements; </li>
				  <li>have a performance-oriented relationship with his subordinates,  super-ordinates and colleagues based on mutual respect to facilitate team work  for collective contribution to the organization; </li>
				  <li>have  a relationship based on long-term mutual benefit approach with customers,  suppliers and other members of the public, and </li>
				  <li>have  communication with colleagues to improve the standard contribution and the  prestige managerial profession. </li>
			    </ol>

                  <p><strong>Professional  Management </strong> <br />
                    The progressive development in the size of  business and the separation of ownership and management in the corporate  enterprises have contributed to the emergence of management as a distinct  profession. A management can be professional not, by hiring professional  managers but by adopting the style of professional management. Professional  management organizes managerial functions by setting long-term objectives,  formulating policies and strategies, developing formal communication<br />
                    network and evaluation system to deal with the emergence of<br />
                    business problems.</p>
                  <p>The  characteristics of professional management are as follows:</p>
                  <p><strong>Body of Knowledge: </strong>Management theory has a philosophy of its own. It is based on  systematic and scientific studies. Precisely, the management of knowledge is’  the passport to enter the world of entrepreneurship.</p>
                  <p><strong>Management  Tools: </strong>Tools of management such as accounting,  business law, psychology, statistics and data processing have been developed to  enhance the practical utility of the science of management.</p>
                  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Specialization: </strong>There is a growing  tendency to select and appoint highly qualified, trained and experienced  persons to manage the business in each functional area of management. This has  created greater demand for professionals.</p>
                  <p><strong>Separate Discipline: </strong>Management studies in  many universities and institutions of higher learning are recognized as a  separate discipline. Seminars, special courses, and training programmes have  become essential in management areas like export management, personnel  management, production management, marketing management, financial’ management,  etc.</p>
                  <p><strong>Code of Conduct: </strong>Business management is  regarded as a social institution. It has social. responsibilities towards  customers, employees’ and the society on the whole. Consumer-oriented marketing  concept is an important corporate code of conduct. Pressure of consumerism,  trade unionism, public opinion and legislation are definitely inducing the  management to evolve a code of ethics for consumer satisfactions and. holding a  major<br />
                    market share.</p>
                  <p><strong>Professional Association: </strong>In our country too,  business management associations have’ been formed. They mainly aim at  spreading the ethics of business management and build up a sound public image  of the managerial profession.<br />
                    A professional manager  is required to possess specific management knowledge relating to (a) Technical  processes, products, materials, equipment and procedures; (b) Economic  knowledge about the basic objective of the entrepreneurs and its position in<br />
                    the economic and social system within which it is operating; (c) Human  knowledge about employee motivation, moral and delegation of authority; and (d)  Administrative knowledge  about  application and analysis of data. This will facilitate him to deal with various  problems of the organisation in an effective manner.<br />
                    A person can become a professional manager  by the acquisition of knowledge through formal education. . An owner-manager  can achieve success due to his personal cultural traits. Many great  entrepreneurs are self-made, for they were not handicapped by<br />
                    their lack of formal education but came out as successful entrepreneurs due to  their skill and intelligence. One can easily identify such an entrepreneur  manager in any profession, may it be bide or aggravate manufacturing, polishing  or grinding, retailing or wholesaling. </p>
                </div>
                <br clear="all" />
                <div>
                  <p><strong>Managers  and Entrepreneurs </strong> <br />
                    Both  managers and entrepreneurs are answerable for producing results. The results  are, of course, different. In their respective result areas, the buck stops  with them. While they can delegate, they are finally accountable. <br />
                    Both  have to produce results through people working with them though they deal with  different sets of people. They are not effective in the long run, if they are  loners. <br />
                    Both  are decision-makers but the decisions are different as their tasks vary. Both  have to operate under constraints, which are understandably different. <br />
                    To  be effective in their respective roles, both have to follow sound principles of  management like planning, staffing, delega­tion and control. The focus of these  management tools may vary depending upon the ultimate purpose. </p>
                  <p><strong>Similarities between Managers and  Entrepreneurs </strong> </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>• To produce results </li>
                    <li>• To produce results through people </li>
                    <li>• To take decisions </li>
                    <li>• To cooperate under constraints </li>
                    <li>• To follow sound principles of management </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>A  successful organisation needs both entrepreneurship and management. The Chief  Executive and his team of top-level executives, the managerial role by the  middle-level and joint-level executives may play the entrepreneurial role; </p>
                  <p><strong>A Management Tool </strong> <br />
                    The  efficiency of professional management lies in the managerial approach, which  does not suffer from dogmatic, ideological and political trappings. It is an  approach which trackless the problem as a ‘whole’ and not in ‘fractions.’ <br />
                    The professional  manager brings into operation planning, organising, staffing, motivating,  controlling and coordinating the work of technocrats and professional aspects  to achieve pre­determined goals. The professional manager must possess a desire  to achieve, to expand, to build and to grow. His goal should be to produce the  best results in the shortest time and at least cost. The manager, who has had  to benefit of management education and has exposed to the managerial tools and  techniques of achieving the profit-cum-growth, will be in a position to deliver  the goods to in developing economy like ours. <br />
                    It  is characteristic of an established profession that its members accept the  obligation to contribute to the advancement of standards and to the education  of the future aspirants. The more eminent the member, the more readily he  recognizes the obliga­tion. ‘It is quite likely that his personal contribution  to teaching may be small but it will be of high quality. This is the task  facing the professional managers of the future. <br />
                    The  entrepreneur may be a, manager but a paid manager cannot acquire the position  of an entrepreneur. <br />
                    An  entrepreneur has great motivation to manage his business successfully. He is  keen towards developing business through innovation, and is satisfied when his  efforts give him positive results. He is the investor, risk-bearer, manager and  controller. The entrepreneur may appoint a manager and delegate some of his  functions. However, manager even after performing his assigned duties cannot  substitute the entrepreneur. <br />
                    The  entrepreneur lays down a broad policy for business, assumes risk and makes the  business a concern. The main factors, which distinguish an entrepreneur from a  professional manager as shown below: </p>

                  <p><strong>Entrepreneur vs. Manager:</strong> The, entrepreneur is a person who is motivated satisfy a high need for  achievement in innovative and creative activities. His creative behaviour and  innovative spirit. which forms a process of an endless chain is termed as  entrepreneurship. It is not enough for the entrepreneur to build up the  process, but equally important task for him is to manage the business. He  performs entrepreneurial vis-à-vis managerial functions. The entrepreneur  enters at a transitional stage in which what is initially with innovation  becomes a routine., for him the transition from entrepreneurship to management.  Also, the emphasis switches from techniques and analytical methods to insight  and to involvement with people. The entrepre­neur perceives and exploits  opportunity, and the subsequent steps necessary for organization and pertinent  to management. <br />
                    The  entrepreneur differs from the professional manager in that he undertakes a  venture for his personal gratification. As such he cannot live within the  framework of occupational behaviour set by others. He may engage professional  manager to perform some of his functions such as setting of objectives,  policies, proce­dures, rules, strategies and formal communication network.  However; the entrepreneurial functions of innovation? Assump­tion of business  risk and commitment to his vision cannot be delegated to the’ professional  manager. Failure to the professional executive may mean a little more than  locating a new job perhaps even at a higher salary, whereas failure of an  entrepreneur in his efforts would mean a devastating loss to his career. The  profes­sional manager has to work within the framework of policy guidelines  laid down by the entrepreneur. </p>

                <div>
                  <p><strong>Entrepreneur and Enterprises </strong> <br />
                    Entrepreneur  is the fourth factor of enterprise. According to Noah Webster, “entrepreneur is  one who assumes the risk and management of business.” <br />
                    The enterprise is the basic unit  of an economic organisation. It produces goods and services worth more than the  resources used. Thus, any effort for it to bear fruit ultimately affect  directly or indirectly individual enterprise. Enterprise is an undertaking,  which involves activity, courage, and energy. It involves the willingness to  assume risks and decision making, in undertaking an economic activity. It also  involves innovation. Thus, entrepre­neur and enterprise are inter-linked,  enterprise being the offshoot of an entrepreneur. Its success is dependent on  the entrepreneur. Peter Drucker has observed, “Innovation is the specific tool  of entrepreneurs, the means by which they exploit change as an opportunity for  a different business or a different service. It is capable of being practiced.” </p>
                </div>
                <p><strong>Intrapreneurs </strong> <br />
                Of late, a new breed  of corporate entrepreneurs has come to the fore in large organizations. They  are called “intrapreneurs.” They are entrepreneurs who catch hold of a new idea  for a product, service, or process and work to bring this idea to fruition  within the framework of the organisation. Intrapreneurs with their innovations  and dedicated effort are perceived as a valuable asset by the organisation,  inspiring others. He serves as a champion to others in the organisation. In  America, a number of intrapreneurs are leaving their jobs to start their own  ventures. Many such intrapreneurs have become exceedingly successful in their  new ventures and, what is more, they are causing a threat to the companies they  left a few years ago.</p>
                <p><img src="001" width="525" height="235" /></p>
                <p><strong>Entrepreneur vs. Administrator </strong> <br />
Management in a small  business organisation is performed quite differently from the management  process in large companies In fact, the role of entrepreneurs is quite  different “from the’ role of professional administrators in large  organisations. A person in effective control of a business unit underlines the  adaptive nature of managerial processes in a small firm. Entrepreneurship has  connotations of enterprise, opportunism, individuality, in contrast to the.  Connotations of the terms “manager” and “administration”, which are associated  with notions of organisation, planning, professionalism, rationality and.  predictive management processes.<br />
The administrator in a  large firm is primarily concerned with those activities relevant to predictive  management processes, that is, with activities related to prediction and  control On the other hand, the owner-manager of a small business organisation  needs primarily to perform activities relevant to adaptive management process,  activities that enable him to exploit the advantages he has in being a small  enterprise. An entrepreneur puts emphasis on the entrepreneurial activities of  management process, so he would hold attitudes related to entrepreneurial  orientation, while the administrator of a large organisation would hold  attitudes related to the administrative.</p>
                <br clear="all" />
                <p><strong>Owner-Manager vs.  Professional-Manager </strong> <br />
                  The owner-manager is  identified with individuality, flair, strong motivation to achieve success and  the urge to grow while the professional manager conjures up a picture of  organising, planning, motivating and controlling. The owner-manager exhibits a  strong desire for independence, which he demonstrates through the building of  an organisation. The owner-manager assumes all business risks and stands to  lose not only his capital but reputation and prestige in the event of failure  of business, whereas the professional manager is not exposed to such risks.</p>
                <p>The differences between an owner-manager and a  professional manager are much deeper which can be studied with respect to the  function, business philosophy, and the characteristic skills which each  incorporates.</p>

                <p><strong>The  Entrepreneurial Network </strong> </p>
                <p>Entrepreneurship is a dynamic process which  requires links not only among and individuals but also among and between a  variety of institutions. The stronger, more complex and more diverse the web of  relationships, the more the entrepreneur is likely to have access to  opportunities, the greater are his chances of solving problems expeditiously,  and ultimately the greater the chances of success for the new venture.</p>
                <p><strong>Conclusion </strong> <br />
Growth is a conscious,  controllable factor, which must be planned and coordinated. Entrepreneurship  plays a crucial role in this growth process. In sum, I realize the managing  change may be my actual theme. I am reminded of something that John Stuart Mill  said more than 100 years ago: “Mankind is divided into those who are still what  they were and those who have changed: into the men of the present age and the  men of the past.” Successfully managing the “unmanageable” requires us to  become those men who have changed. It requires flexibility, imagination and a  willingness to accept change as an opportunity and a stimulus for development and  growth. Therefore, organizations, governments and society must encourage it. </p>
                <p>Entrepreneurship perceives opportunities inherent  in change, creates a desire for pursuing them and creates an environment in  which success is possible. The concept of the entrepreneur should be understood  in its broadest sense that he is a person who acts as an agent of change for  the good of the people. He not only brings change in economy but is responsible  for social development also. At the same time, the professional manager  translates the entrepreneurial vision into a reality by adopting his  professional efficiency and managerial skills. The entrepreneur and  professional managers are, therefore, a critical input of socio­economic  development.</p>
