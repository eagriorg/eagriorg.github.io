				<p><strong>Introduction </strong> <br />
With  the quickened pace of economic development under the impetus of the Five-Year  Plans, the most striking change in the Indian economy has been the initiation  of an industrial revolutionist and the reemergence of small-scale industries.  Further, during the past decade, there has been a deepening as well as widening  of the entrepreneurial structure as well as the small-scale preindustrial  structure. Not only have the established small industries increased their  installed capacity and output, but a wide range of new small industries has  also come into being. During the last two decades, there is a boom of  entrepreneurial activities in the country. Thus, in the field of capital-and  product goods industries, enterprises manufacturing such items as machine  tools, electrical and’ engineering equipment, chemicals etc., which provide the  foundation for a self (sustained growth of the economy have been set-up.  Amongst the consumer goods industries, small units producing such items as  -bicycles, sewing machines, plastic products, etc. are forgoing ahead. <br />
These far-reaching developments and the  scale and scope of operation of entrepreneurs, particularly in small-scale  industries, have brought to the fore the importance -of provision of  administrative and institutional assistance at various levels. <br />
Over the years, financial institutions  are playing a key role in providing finance and counseling to the entrepreneurs  to start new ventures as well as mode diversify and even rehabilitate sick  enterprises. In this context, we shall discuss the scale and scope of operation  of various development banks (institutions) that have been rendering financial  assistance, directly or indirectly, to entrepreneurs and their various  ventures. . <br />
<strong>Development Function </strong> <br />
Development  being the function of capital, as the tempo of development grows NS, so does  the requirement for capital. The need for capital is continuous and (also  boundless. However, capitals is not only necessary for development’ but  capital, (also generated by development. Economic progress creates its  surpluses with which further deployment is achieved, often at an accelerated  rate. India’s Five-Year Plans are a proof in themselves that substantially  larger resources used is each successive plan same from the economic growth  resulting from investment in the preceding plans. Only a relatively small part  of the resources came from external sources though they were crucial to  development. Similarly, in consonance with the development activities in the  country, the development banks activities are on higher scale as well as  diversified in multi-directional way. </p>

                  <p><strong>Institutional Finance </strong> <br />
                    With the launching of the Five Year  Plans, in the absence of a sufficiently broad domestic capital market, there  .was need for adopting and enlarging the institutional structure to meet the  medium and long-term credit requirements of the industrial sector. It was in  this context that the RBI took the initiative in setting-up statutory  corporations at the all-India and’ regional levels to function as specialised  financial agencies purveying term credit. <br />
                    <img width="522" height="255" src="lec2021_clip_image002.jpg" /> </p>

                <div>
                  <p><strong>Institutional Framework for  Industry </strong> <br />
                    Institutional  finance for -large, medium, small and tiny industries by commercial banks - the  State Bank of India group, nationalized banks, private sector banks and  development corporations which have been especially established to provide  industrial finance. In addition, the Reserve Bank of India gives credit  guarantees and the ECGC gives export guarantees to the small-scale sector. By  its refinance operations, the Industrial Development Bank of India, too, plays  a significant role in the promotion of the small scale-sector for it has  enabled the SFCs SSIDC/SSIACS and commercial banks to extend a large quantum of  financial assistance to this sector. The National Small Industries Corporation  offers financial assistance is the form of its hire-purchase schemes. <br />
                    This apart, a host of newly cropped up  institutions such as mutual funds, lease companies, financial service  institutions, investment companies, merchant banks, asset management companies  etc. provide financial assistance and financial services to industries. Some of  them go to’ the extent of conceiving a project and see through its progress  till the end. <br />
                    In India, long-term loans are provided  for a host of financial institutions of the five all-India develop merits IDBI  and SIDBI are apex banks providing refinance facilities to other institutions.  Like-wise, NABARD is an apex bank for agricultural finance and Exim bank of  export import trade. Then industrial development banks, special institutions,  saving and investment institutions, financial service institutions and  regulatory institutions. RBI, SEBI, and NSEIL are three regulatory bodies. <br />
                    In the cumulative sanctions by AFIs up to end-March 1998, IDBI  (including resource support to other FIs)’ claimed the largest share (33.6%),  fo1l9wed by ICICI (25.7%), IFCI (11.1 %), SIDBI (8.2%) and LIC I (1.4%). UTI  and LIC (including resource support to other Fls) accounted for 11.6% and 4.8%  respectively, followed by GIC (1.7%). Of the state-level institutions, SFCs and  SIDCs claimed 6.5% and 3.5% respectively. <br />
                    The  area of operation of development almost covers all key sectors of the economy,  i.e., agriculture, small industries, rural industries medium and large  industries, infrastructure, housing, export and import trade, shipping,  ‘capital market stock exchange, saving, investment, insurance, credit  guarantee, financial service etc. Special institutions have cropped up to  foster development a special area of activities. The financial institutions  have even set­up institution to rehabilitate sick enterprises. <br />
                    By and large’, a greater slice of  domestic savings are mopped up by commercial banks (Rs. 4, 75,000 crores), Unit  Trusts of India (Rs. 65,000 crores), Life Insurance Corporation (Rs. 90,000  crores), General Insurance (Rs. 20,000 crores), and mutual funds and other  financial companies (Rs. 100,000 crores). Even IDBI, ICICI, SIDBI have  commenced mopping up deposits from the public. The aggregate resources  available for investment with financial institutions adds up to over 7,50,000  crores. Sources of funds (long-term funds) for development are given in the  following figure. <br />
                    Financial assistance to entre­preneurs  is granted by commercial banks, State Financial Corporations, State Directorate  of Industries, Na­tional Small Industries Corporation, state Small Industries  Corporations, and - all-India - development banks. <br />
                    Credit facilities granted, by com­mercial  banks - and State Financial Corporations are covered under the- Credit  Guarantee Scheme for Indus­ tries, which offers protection to credit  institutions against possible loss on their lending to this sector. <br />

                    In  its development role, the Industrial Finance Corporation has undertaken various  promotional activities. The resources for financing such activities come from  the benevolent ‘Reserve Fund-which was created in terms of an amendment of the  IFC Act in 1972, and from the allocation of the Interest Differential Funds by  the Government. The Interest Differential Funds are received in the form of  loans and grants on a 50:50 basis under an agreement entered into by the  Government of India with the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany in  respect of lines of credit from the Kreditarnstalt fur Wideraufbau allocated to  the Corporation from time to time. The promotional activities undertaken by the  Corporation - which are, no doubt, still modest- in their scope are in  consonance with the measure which need to be taken to achieve the objective of  broadening the entrepreneurial bases in the country, particularly in less  developed areas. The promotional activities, undertaken by the Corporation are  briefly reviewed here. <br />
                    The Corporation’s Technical Assistance  Scheme for training middle level executives of the State financial and development  agencies and the senior executives of these organisations continues to elicit a  good response because it has been found to be very useful. Since the inception  of the scheme in 1971, 78 middle level executives from 33 state level  institutions and 43 senior executives from 28 state level institutions have  availed themselves of the scheme, which aims at acquainting them with the  policies, procedures and practices of the Corporation. </p>

                    <li>Financial Indo-US joint ventures in research and development. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In practice only such  projects costing in excess of Rs. 300 lakhs are considered for financial  assistance by the ICICI. However, for purpose of foreign currency loans, no  minimum project cost restriction is imposed. <br />
                      <strong>Finance for Industry </strong> <br />
                    Over  the past thirty years, the ICICI, in pursuit of its objective of promoting  industrial development, has provided financial assistance in various forms,  such as: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Underwriting of public and private issues and offers of sale  of industrial securities ordinary shares, preference shares, bonds and  debenture stock; </li>
                    <li>Direct subscription to such securities; </li>
                    <li>Securing loans in rupees, repayable over periods up to 15  years. </li>

                    <li>Guaranteeing payments for credits made by others; </li>
                    <li>Providing credit facilities to-manufacturers for the  promotion of the sale of industrial equipment on deferred payment terms. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The primary purposes for which  assistance is extended is the purchase of capital assets in the’ form of land,  buildings -and machinery. Of the alternative types of assistance provided by  the ICICI, the one best calculated to assure the success of enterprise in  chosen in each case. <br />
                    Any company with a limited liability (or  the promoter of such a company), any sole proprietary concern, partnership firm  or any cooperative society may approach the ICICI for assistance in financing a  sound proposal for the establisl1me’nt, expansion or modernization of an  industrial enterprise. <br />
                    The applicant may be an Indian or  foreigner; his plans may provide for invent in any part of India; he may  require assistance in any form. He must, however, be prepared’ to make a reason­able  contribution to’ the resources required for the implantation of his proposal.  The enterprise should have, or should undertake to obtain, experienced  management and expert technical person­nel and advice. Special consideration is  given to projects promoted by new entrepreneurs and those who desire to set up  industries in backward areas. <br />
                    There are neither firm limits to the  size of the enterprise the ICICI is prepared to assist, nor is there a maximum  or a mini­mum limit to the assistance that it may offer. In practice, the lower  limit of the finance provided by the ICICI is set at Rs. 5 lakh because there  are other institutions which provide assistance for smaller amounts. However,  to meet the requirements of industry for loans in foreign currency, the ICICI  may offer assistance for smaller amounts. However, to meet the require­ments of  industry for loans in foreign currency, the ICICI may offer assistance below  this limit. At the upper end, prudence requires that it limit the proportion of  its resources, which it can safely invest in a single enterprise. However, no  proposal is too large for the ICICI to handle it is prepared to enlist the co­operation  of other financial institutions, in India and abroad, to share in the  investment. <br />
                    In promoting  industrial investment, the ICICI is anxious not only to invest, but also to  encourage others to invest. Accordingly, it seeks to encourage other financial  institutions and individuals, both Indian and - foreign, to co-operate with it  in its investment and lending operations. . <br />
                    In  order to promote new industries, to assist in the expansion and modernization  of existing industries, and to furnish technical and managerial assistance, the  ICICI grants long term and medium term loans, subscribes to shares, underwrites  new shares and debentures, guarantees loans form other private investment  sources, and provides managerial and technical advice. ICICI also provides  assistance byway of suppliers credit, equipment, leasing, installment sale and  venture capital and renders merchant banking services. Technology, development  and information company of India Ltd. (TBICI), established by ICICI in 1988,  provides technological information and finances technology intensive development  activities including commercial R&amp;D schemes. It also manages the venture  capital fund of Rs. 20 crores that ICICI had established along with UTI in  1988. </p>

The Committee envisaged the role of the  Reserve Bank as one” of spawning, fostering and nurturing the new bank, in much  the same way as it did earlier in the case of the Agricultural Refinance and  Develop­ment Corporation. <br />
                    On its establishment,  the National Bank has taken over the entire undertaking Of the” Agricultural  Refinance and Development Corporation and has taken over from “ the- Reserve  Bank its refinancing functions in relation to the State Cooperative Rural “,  Banks.

The Act provides for constitution by  the Board of an Advisory Council consisting, of the directors of the National  Bank and other persons having special knowledge of subjects “which is  considered useful to the bank, to tender advice and discharge many functions  allotted to it. In effect, the Advisory Council will perform functions similar  to those entrusted to the Agricultural Credit Board set up by the Reserve Bank. </p>

                  <p><strong>5.  The Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) </strong> <br />
                    The  idea of setting up small industries development bank of India (SIDBI), in  response to a long standing domain form the small scale sector as an apex level  national institution for promotion, financing and development of industries in  the small scale sector, embodied an opportunity to set up proactive, responsive  and forward looking institution to serve the current and emerging needs of  small scale industries in the country. As a precursor to the setting up of the  new institution, the small industries development fund was cleared by  industrial development fund was created by industrial development bank of India  (IDBI) in 1986 exclusively for refinancing, bills rediscounting and equity  support to the small castle sector. <br />
                    The  outstanding portfolio of the order of Rs. 4200 crore from IDBI was transferred  to SIDBI in March 1990. SIDBI started off from a strong base; percentage of  IDBI, banking of a special statute, the small industries development bank of  India act of 1989, a large capital base of Rs, 450 crore, availability of  experi­enced manpower endowed with development banking skills carved out of  IDBIs professional staff and ready availability of a cast network of  institutional infrastructure and enduring financial linkages with state  financial corporations (SFCs), commercial banks and other institutions; all  these augured well for the growth of the nascent institution.’ SIDBI ‘ became  operational on April 2, 1990. <br />

                    Indian  economy has been in transition for most part of the last five years: the  industrial policy, fiscal policy, public sector policy, foreign investment  policy, trade policy and monetary and credit policies have been in various  stages of liberalisation. Decontrol, deregulation and delicensing have given  enormous scope for private initiative and market forces to come to play. New  relationships within and between different sectors in the economy are being  evolved; the small-scale sector has been an important constituent of such a  liberalisation in the country, Government of India formulated a set of new  policies aimed at harnessing the potential of the small-scale sector in August  1991 a year and-half after the establishment of SIDBI. The prescriptions of the  policy focused at removal of implements affecting the growth of small-scale  sector together With consolidation of the strengths, in the context of the  emerging economic order. SIDBI has been refining its strategies and business  policies in alignment with the policy, charges that have been taking place at  the national level. </p>

                <p><strong>Shift in Business Mix </strong> <br />
                  The new schemes  designed and implemented were directed at filling the gaps in the existing  credit delivery system focusing on new target groups and activities. These are  targeted at addressing some of the major problems of SSIs, in areas such as  marketing, infrastructure development, delayed realization of bills,  ancillarisation, obsolescence of technology, quality improvement, export  financing and venture capital assistance. The terms of assistance under various  schemes have been substantially liberalised based on ongoing review process.  The procedures have been simplified with gradual decentralization and  progressive levels of operational efficiency and better customer service. <br />
                  To  mitigate the difficulties faced by SSIs on account of delayed payments, two  factoring companies, viz., SBI factors and commercial services Pvt. Ltd. And  can bank factors Ltd. have been established with SIDBI as a partner with 20%  shareholding, SIDBI has enlarged the list of institutional member of over the  counter exchange of India (OTCEI). This facilitates SSIs to access capital  market through the route of OTCEI in raising resources in a cost-effective  manner. SIDBI has overall productiv­ity, product quality levels and process  standards in such clusters. Significant achievements made in these spheres will  be buttressed with new initiatives in the years to come. </p>

                    The  Industrial Investment Bank of India (IIBI) was established in 1985 under the  IRBI Act, 1984 on reconstitution of the erstwhile Industrial Reconstruction  Corporation of India as the principal credit and reconstruction agency to,  undertake reconstruction and rehabilitation of sick and closed industrial units  in the country. IRBI was converted into a full-fledged all-purpose development  institution as IIBI on 17.03.97. The scope of IIBIs financing activities has  widened with the withdrawal of the Government stipulation that 60% of its  portfolio should consist of ‘ sick companies; IIBI now finances all industrial  projects like any other financial institution. <br />
                    IIBI extends loans and advances to  industrial concerns, under­writes stocks, shares, bonds, and debentures and  provides guarantees, for loans/deferred payments. It provides finance for  acquisition of equipment and makes available machinery and other equipment on  lease or hire purchase basis. It also provides infrastructure facilities,  consultancy, managerial and merchant banking services. During 1993-94, as a  part of its merchant banking services, IRSI ventured into issue management  activities for the first time. It also took several steps to re-orient its  business strategy in response to the emerging environment and ongoing changes  in the financial sector by introducing newer products for financing. IIBI has  envisaged the setting up of a Special Fund, viz., Reconstruction Assistance  Fund to meet special financial needs of ‘ assisted medium and large-scale units  for their revival and rehabilitation which cannot be met from banks and’  financial institutions under normal conditions. </p>

                    The  Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC), established by an Act of  Parliament in 1956, is engaged in the development of khadi and village  industries in rural areas. It has under its purview 26 village, industries  besides khadi. After amendment to the KVIC Act in July 1987, the scope for  coverage of activities was widened’ and as a consequence 70 more new village  industries were identified and brought under its fold for implementation. The  main objectives of the KVIC are providing employment in rural areas, skill  improvement, transfer of technology, building up of strong rural community base  and rural industrialisation. The significant characteristics of khadi and  village industries under the purview of KVIC lie in their ability to use  locally available raw materials, local skills, local markets, low per capita  investment, simple techniques of production, which can be easily adopted by the  rural people, short gestation period and above all production of consumer  goods. KVI activities serve the poorest of the poor comprising scheduled’  castes, scheduled tribes, women, physically handicapped and minority  communities in difficult, inaccessible hill and border areas. <br />

Formerly, the  Corporation had four subsidiary corporations at Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta and  Chennai. However, since 1961, all the subsidiary corporations have been  amalgamated with the main Corporation, and three Branch Offices have been  set-up at Mumbai, Calcutta and Chennai. The Delhi subsidiary corporation has  been merged with the parent Corporation, and its work is looked after by a  separate Delhi Cell set­up in it. The National Small Industries Corporation  provides a complete package of financial assistance and support in the  following areas: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Supply of both indigenous and imported machines on easy  hire-purchase terms.

                  With a view to  giving a fillip to development efforts and to supplement the activities of  State Small Industries Corporations and District Industries Service Institutes,  the NSIC has opened its offices  in some of the States in which the (NSIC) Corporation has been hitherto  under-represented. In the central region, offices have been opened in Bhopal  and Raipur in Madhya Pradesh. Four development executives and six field  inspectors have been, recently posted in the backward areas of the western  region to serve as “contact points” and to work in close co-operation with DICs  and other developmental agencies in the area. Of these, three field inspectors  have been posted in Raigad, Ratnagiri, Satara, Yeomen, Chandrapur, Bhandara,  Buldhana, Aurangabad, Nanded, Seed, Osmanabad, etc. all backward districts in  Maharashtra. <br />

                  A  Unique Package of Assistance for Small Entrepreneurs.<br />
                  The  NSIC has taken up the challenging task of promoting and developing small  industries almost from the scratch and has adopted an “integratedapproach” to  achieve its socio-economic objectives. It has created a proper “industrial”  atmosphere and has infused confidence in the small entrepreneurs to prepare  schemes for the manufacture of products or identify the balancing equipment for  purposes of modernization and or diversification. The small unit, because it is  small, is always short of resources. The NSIC therefore, supplies machinery and  equipment, marketing inputs and technical support to small units. And so the seedling  comes up as a “factory” which provides jobs for the unemployed or  underemployed. <br />
                  Over  the years and particularly during this decade, the NSIC, with its deliberate  and concentrated efforts, has developed an unsur­passed reputation of an  effective and efficient nodal agency for providing assistance to the vibrant  Small-Scale sector. All these years, through, its dynamic approach and the  package of assis­tance, it has been significantly contributing to the  development of entrepreneurs, building up Of’ strong industrial base, spreading  of technical culture, promoting balanced regional growth, development of rural  and backward areas, etc. as well as in employment generation, in all parts of  the country. </p>
