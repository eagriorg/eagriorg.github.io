				<p><strong>Source: The Unexpected </strong><br />
            No other area  offers richer opportunities for successful innovation than the unexpected  success. In no other area are innovative opportunities less risky and their  pursuit less arduous. Yet the expected success is almost totally neglected;  worse, managements tend actively to reject it. </p>
				<p><strong>The Unexpected failure </strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Failures, unlike successes, cannot be rejected and rarely go  unnoticed. But they are seldom seen as symptoms of opportunity. A good many  failures are, of course, nothing but mistakes, the results of greed, stupidity,  thoughtless bandwagon-climbing, or incompetence whether in design or execution.  Yet if something fails despite being carefully planned, carefully designed, and  conscientiously executed, that failure often bespeaks underlying change and,  with it, opportunity. </p>
				<p>            The assumptions on  which a product or service, its design or its marketing strategy, were based  may no longer fit reality. Perhaps customers have changed their values and  perceptions; while they still buy the same “thing,” they are actually  purchasing a very different “value,” Or perhaps what has always been one market  or one end use is splitting itself into two or more, each demanding something  quite different. Any change like this is an opportunity for innovation. </p>
				<p><strong>The unexpected outside event</strong><br />
				  Unexpected  successes and unexpected failure have so far been discusses as occurring within  a business or an industry. But outside events, that is, events that rare not  recorded in the information and the figures by which a management steers its  institution, are just as important. Indeed, they often are more important. <br />
				  Here are some  examples showing typical unexpected outside events and their exploitation as  major opportunities for successful innovation. </p>

                <p><strong>Source: Incongruities </strong><br />
                  An incongruity is a  discrepancy, a dissonance, between what is and what “ought” to be, or between  what is and what everybody assumes it to be. We may not understand the reason  for it; indeed, we often cannot figure it out. Still, an incongruity is a  symptom of an opportunity to innovate. It bespeaks an underlying “fault,” to  use the geologist’s term. Such a fault is an invitation to innovate. It creates  an instability in which quite minor efforts can move large masses and bring  about a restructuring of the economic or social configuration. Incongruities do  not, however, usually manifest themselves in the figures or reports executives  receive and pay attention to. They are qualitative rather than quantitative. <br />
                  Like the unexpected  event, whether success or failure, incongruity is a symptom of change, either  change that has already occurred or change that can be made to happen. Like the  changes that underlie the unexpected event, the changes that underlie  incongruity are changes within an industry, a market, a process. The  incongruity is thus clearly visible to the people within or close to the  industry, market, or process; it is directly in front of their eyes. Yet it is  often overlooked by the insiders, who tend to take it for grated – “This is the  way it’s always been”, they say, even though “always” may be a very recent  development. </p>
                <p>There are several  kinds of incongruity:<br />
                  -An incongruity between the economic realities of an industry (or of  a public-service area);<br />
                  -An incongruity between the reality of an industry (or of a public  service area) and the assumptions about it; <br />
                  -An incongruity between the efforts of an industry (or a public  service area) and the values and expectations of its customers; <br />
                  -An internal incongruity within the rhythm or the logic of a  process. </p>

                </strong>
                <p><strong>Source: Process need </strong><br />
                  “Opportunity is the  source of innovation” has been the leitmotif of the preceding chapters. But an  old proverb says, “Necessity is the mother of invention”. This chapter looks at  need as a source of innovation, and indeed as a major innovative opportunity. <br />
                  The need we shall  discuss as a source of innovative opportunity is a very specific one: I call it  “process need”. It is not vague or general but quite concrete. Like the  unexpected, or the incongruities, it exists within the process of a business,  an industry, or a service. Some innovations based on process need exploit  incongruities, others demographics. Indeed, process need, unlike the other  sources of innovation, does not start out with an event in the environment,  whether internal or external. It starts out with the job to be done. It is  task-focused rather than situation-focused. It perfects a process that already  exists, replaces a link that is weak, redesigns an existing old process around  newly available knowledge. Sometimes it makes possible a process by supplying  the “missing link”. </p>
                <p>            In innovations that  are based on process need, everybody in the organization always knows that the  need exists. Yet usually no one does anything about it. However, when the  innovation appears, it is immediately accepted as “obvious” and soon becomes  “standard”. <br />
                  There are, however, some important caveats</p>
                <ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>The need must be understood. It is       not enough for it to be “felt” Otherwise one cannot define the       specification for the solution. </li>
                  <li>We may even understand a process       and still not have the knowledge to do the job. </li>
                  <li>The solution must fit the way       people do the work and want to do it. Amateur photographers had no       psychological investment in the complicated technology of the early       photographic process. </li>
                </ol>

                </strong>
                <p><strong>Source: Industry and Market Structures </strong><br />
                  Industry and market structures sometimes last for many,  many years and seem completely stable. The world aluminum industry, for instance,  after one century is still led by the Pittsburgh-based Aluminium Company of  America which held the original patents, and by its Canadian offspring, Alcan  of Montreal. There has only been one major new comer in the world’s cigarette  industry since the 1920s, the South African Rembrandt group. And in an entire  century only two newcomers have emerged as leading electrical apparatus  manufactures in the world. Philips in Holland and Hitachi in Japan. Similarly  no major new retail chain emerged in the United States for forty years, between  the early twenties when Sears. Roebuck began to move from mail order into  retail stores, and the mid-sixties when an old dime-store chain, Kresge,  launched the K-Mart discount stores. Indeed, industry and market structures  appear so solid that the people in an industry are likely to consider them  foreordained, part of the order of nature, and certain to endure forever. <br />
                  Actually, market  and industry structures are quite brittle. One small scratch and they  disintegrate, often fast. When this happens, every member of the industry has  to act. To continue to do business as before is almost a guarantee of disaster  and might well condemn a company to extinction. At the very least the company  will lose its leadership position; and once lost, such leadership is almost  never regained. But a change in market or industry structure is also a major  opportunity for innovation. <br />
                  In industry  structure, a change requires entrepreneurship from every member of the  industry. It requires that each one ask anew; “What is our business?” And each  of the members will have to give a different, but above all a new, answer to  that question. </p>
                <p><strong>Source: Demographics</strong><br />
                  The unexpected;  incongruities; changes in market and industry structure; and process needs –  the sources of innovative opportunity discussed so far in Chapter 3 through 6 –  manifest themselves within a business an industry, or a market. They may  actually be symptoms of changes outside, in the economy, in society, and in  knowledge. But they show up internally. </p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Demographics </li>
                  <li>Changes in perception, meaning and       mood</li>
                  <li>New knowledge </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The remaining sources of innovative opportunity are external. They  are changes in the social, philosophical, political, and intellectual  environment. <br />
                  Of all external changes, demographics – defined as changes in  population, its size, age structure, composition, employment, educational  status, and income – are the clearest. They are unambiguous. They have the most  predictable consequences. </p>
                <p>            Demographics have  major impact on what will be bought, by whom, and in what quantities. American  teenagers, for instance, buy a good many pairs of cheap shoes a year; they buy  for fashion, not durability, and their purses are limited. The same people, ten  years later, will buy very few pairs of shoes a year – a sixth as many as they  bought when they were seventeen – but they will buy them for comfort and  durability first and for fashion second. People in their sixties and seventies  in the developed countries-that is, people in their early retirement years form  the prime travel and vacation market. Ten years later the same people are  customers for retirement communities, nursing homes, and extended (and  expensive) medical care. Two-earner families have more money than they have  time, and spend accordingly. People who have acquired extensive schooling in  their younger years, especially professional or technical schooling, will, ten  to twenty years later, become customers for advanced professional training. </p>
                <p><strong>Source: Changes in perception </strong><br />
                  In mathematics  there is no difference between “The glass is half full” and “The glass is half  empty”. But the meaning of these two statements is totally different, and so  are their consequences. If general perception changes from seeing the glass as  “half full” to seeing it as “half empty”, there are major innovative  opportunities.</p>
                <p><strong>Source: New Knowledge </strong><br />
                  Knowledge-based  innovation is the “super-star” of entrepreneurship. It gets the publicity. It  gets the money. It is what people normally mean when they talk of innovation.  Of course, not all knowledge-based innovations are important. Some are truly  trivial. But amongst the history – making innovations, knowledge-based  innovations rank high. The knowledge, however, is not necessarily scientific or  technical. Social innovations based on knowledge can have equal or even greater  impact. <br />
                  Knowledge-based  innovation differs from all other innovations in its basic characteristics:  time span, casualty rate, predictability, and in the challenges it poses to the  entrepreneur. And like most “super-starts”, knowledge-based innovation is  temperamental, capricious, and hard to manage. </p>
                <p><strong>The characteristics of knowledge-based innovation </strong><br />
                  Knowledge-based  innovation has the longest lead time of all innovations. There is, first, a  long time span between the emergence of new knowledge and its becoming  applicable to technology. And then there is another long period before the new  technology turns into products, processes, or services in the marketplace.</p>
