				</p>
				<p>India has a  well developed tax structure with a three-tier federal structure, comprising  the Union Government, the State Governments and the Urban/Rural Local Bodies.  The power to levy taxes and duties is distributed among the three tiers of  Governments, in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Constitution. The  main taxes/duties that the Union Government is empowered to levy are Income Tax  (except tax on agricultural income, which the State Governments can levy),  Customs duties, Central Excise and Sales Tax and Service Tax. The principal  taxes levied by the State Governments are Sales Tax (tax on intra-State sale of  goods), Stamp Duty (duty on transfer of property), State Excise (duty on manufacture  of alcohol), Land Revenue (levy on land used for agricultural/non-agricultural  purposes), Duty on Entertainment and Tax on Professions &amp; Callings. The  Local Bodies are empowered to levy tax on properties (buildings, etc.), Octroi  (tax on entry of goods for use/consumption within areas of the Local Bodies),  Tax on Markets and Tax/User Charges for utilities like water supply, drainage,  etc.<br />
Since 1991 tax  system in India has under gone a radical change, in line with liberal economic  policy and WTO commitments of the country. Some of the changes are:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Reduction in customs and excise  duties </li>
				  <li>Lowering corporate Tax</li>
				  <li>Widening of the tax base and  toning up the tax administration</li>

  <strong>Corporate  Income Tax</strong><strong> </strong><br />
				  For domestic  companies, this is levied @ 35% plus surcharge of 5%, where as for a foreign  company (including branch/project offices), it is @ 40% plus surcharge of 5%.
