				<p><strong>shares  and securities</strong></p>
				<p><strong> 1. Issue of Shares</strong><br />
				  This is the most common method of raising long-term funds.  Every company in India generally uses this  method.<br />
  <strong><em>Meaning  of </em></strong><strong>share</strong><br />
				  A share may be defined as one of the units into which the  share capital of a company has been divided. According  to Section 2 (46) of the Companies Act, &quot;a  share is the share in the capital of a company and includes stock except where  a distinction between stock and share is expressed  or implied&quot;.<br />
				  The person holding the share is known as a shareholder. He receives dividend from the company as a consideration for investing his  money into the company. However, payment of  dividend is not legally compulsory. The power to  recommend dividend vests in the Board of Directors of the company. The recommendation of the Directors is put before the general meeting of the shareholders who may reduce  the rate of dividend as recommended by the Board  but cannot increase it.<br />
  <strong><em>Types of Shares</em></strong><br />
				  A public company can issue only two  types of shares. They are (i) Preference shares, and (ii) Equity shares.<br />
  <strong>(a) Preference shares</strong><br />
				  Preference shares are those  which carry the following preferential rights over other classes of shares:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>A preferential right in respect of a fixed  dividend. It may consist of a fixed amount  (say  Rs. 50,000 p.a.) or a fixed rate.</li>
				  <li>A preferential right as to repayment of  capital in the case of winding up of the company in priority to other classes  of shares.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
				<p><strong><em>Merits </em></strong><strong><em>of Preference </em></strong><strong><em>Shares</em></strong><br />
				  (i)  Financing through preference shares is a flexible financing arrangement since payment of dividend is  not a legal obligation of  the company issuing the preference shares. <br />
				  (ii) Preference shares have no final maturity date  (except redeemable preference  shares) and thus, in a sense, the funds provided  by them is a sort of perpetual loan. <br />
				  (iii) Preference shares add to the equity base of the company and thereby strengthen its financial position. <br />
				  (iv) Preference share capital is also a sort of cushion to the  debenture holders and thus they save the company from paying higher rate of interest.,<br />
				  (vi) Preference shares are entitled to a fixed  rate of dividend. <br />
				  (vii) Issuing of preference shares does not materially disturb  the existing pattern of control of the  company as compared to the issue of equity shares  since preference shareholders are entitled to vote only on such resolutions which directly affect their interests.<br />
				  (viii) Financing  through preference shares is cheaper as compared to financing through equity shares.<br />
				  (ix) Preference shares are  particularly useful for those investors who want higher rate of  <br />
				  return with  comparatively lower risk.<br />
				  (x)  The company can  utilise huge surplus funds at its disposal by redeeming the redeemable preference shares as per the provisions of the Companies Act.<br />
  <strong><em>Demerits of Preference  Shares</em></strong><br />
				  (1) One of the principal disadvantages of financing through preference shares is that preference dividend is not  deductible as an expense for taxation purpose out of  the profits of the company. <br />
				  (ii) Preference  shares dilute the claim of the equity shareholders over the assets of the company.<br />
				  (iii) Preference shares may pave the way for the insolvency of  the company in cases where the directors  continue to pay dividends on them in spite of  lower profits to maintain their attractiveness.</p>
				<p><strong>b) Equity Shares</strong><br />
				  These are shares which are not  preference shares. They do not carry any preferential right. They will rank after preference shares for the purposes of dividend and repayment  of capital in the event of company's winding up. The rate  of dividend on these shares is not<br />
				  fixed. It depends on the availability of divisible profits and the  intention of the directors. The shares have the  chance of earning good dividends in times of prosperity  and also run the risk of earning nothing in periods  of adversity. The equity shareholders control the company on account of their entitlement to vote at the general meeting of  the company. These shares are preferred by  persons who prefer risk to better return and also  wish to have a say in the management of the company. The equity share capital is also termed as the venture capital on account  of the risk involved in it.<br />
  <strong><em>Sweat Equity Shares</em></strong><br />
				  The term Sweat Equity Shares means the equity shares issued by a company to employees or directors at a discount  for consideration other than cash or for  providing know-how or making available rights in the  nature of intellectual property rights or value additions,  by whatever name called.<br />
  <strong><em>Merits of Equity Shares</em></strong><br />
				  (i) Financing through equity shares does not  impose any burden on the  company since payment of dividend on these shares depends on the availability of profits and the  discretion of the Directors.<br />
				  (ii) Capital raised through equity  shares is also a sort of perpetual loan for the company since it is not repayable during the lifetime of the company. It is  repayable only in the event of company's winding up and that too only after the claims of preference shareholders have been met in  full.<br />
				  (iii) Equity shares do not carry any charge against the assets  of the company hence the capacity of the company to raise additional funds through borrowings on the security of its assets is  in no way diminished.<br />
				  (iv) The company does not face the risk  of magnifying its losses in periods  of adversity.<br />
				  (v) Financing through equity shares also provides the company with sufficient flexibility in the utilisation of its profits  and funds since neither the payment of  dividend is compulsory not any provision is to be  made for repayment of capital.<br />
  <strong><em>Demerits </em></strong><em>of <strong>Equity Shares</strong></em><br />
				  (i) Financing through equity shares is costly. Moreover, the dividend on equity shares is not deductible as an expense out of profits for taxation purposes.<br />
				  (ii) The control of the company can be easily manipulated through cornering of shares by a group of shareholders for their personal advantage at the cost of company's interest.<br />
				  (iii) Excessive reliance on  financing through equity shares reduces the capacity of the company to trade on equity. This may ultimately result in over capitalisation of the company.<br />
				  (v) The cost of underwriting; and distributing the equity  share capital is generally higher than that for  preference share capital or debentures.</p>
				<p><strong><em>Methods of Issue of Shares</em></strong><br />
				  Shares can be issued at par, premium or  discount. There are no restrictions  regarding issue of shares at par. However, for issue of shares at premium or discount, a company  has to follow the restrictions  imposed by the Companies Act, 1956. These restrictions are as follows:<br />
  <em>Issue  of shares at premium. </em>A  company can <em>always  Issue </em>shares at a premium, i.e., for a value higher than the face value of shares  whether for cash or for consideration  other than cash. However, according to Section  78 of the Companies Act, the amount of such premium shall have to be transferred by the company to the  Securities Premium Account.' The  securities premium can be used by the company only for the following purposes:<br />
  <em>(a) </em>for the issue of  fully paid bonus shares to the members of the company,<br />
				  (b) for writing off preliminary expenses of the company;<br />
				  (c) for writing off the expenses of, or  the commission paid or, discount allowed, on any issue of  shares or debentures of the company;  and<br />
				  (d)  for providing premium payable on the redemption of any redeemable<br />
				  preference shares or debentures of the company.<br />
  <em>Issue of shares at discount. </em>A company can issue shares at a discount  (i.e., for a consideration  less than the nominal values of the, shares) subject to the following conditions laid down by Section 79 of the Companies Act.<br />
				  I . Shares to be issued at a discount must  be of a class already issued.<br />
				  2. Issue of  shares at a discount must be authorised by an ordinary resolution of the company.<br />
				  3. Issue must be sanctioned by the  Company Law Board.<br />
				  4. Resolution  must specify the maximum rate of discount. No such resolution shall be sanctioned by the Company  Law Board if the maximum  rate of discount specified in the resolution exceeds 10% unless the Board is of the opinion that a higher percentage of discount may be  allowed in the special circumstances  of the case.<br />
				  5. One year must  have passed since the date on which the company was allowed to commence business.<br />
				  6. Issue must  take place within two months after the date of the sanction of the Company Law Board unless the time  is further extended.<br />
				  7. Every prospectus  relating to the issue of shares shall disclose particulars of the discount allowed on the issue of  shares or that amount which  has not been written off at the date of the issue of prospectus.<br />
				  Restrictions on  the issue of shares at a discount as set out above do not apply in the case of debentures since they  do not form the capital  fund to the company but are merely creditor ship securities.</p>
