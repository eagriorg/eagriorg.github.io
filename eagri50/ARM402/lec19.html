				<p><strong>1. Venture Capital Institutions</strong><br />
                  <strong><em>Concept of </em>Venture Capital</strong><br />
Venture capital is a form of equity financing designed specially for  funding high risk and high reward projects.  It not only plays an important role in  financing hi-technology projects, but also helps to turn research and development projects into  commercial production. Venture  capital, besides financing the technology, is also involved in fostering the growth and development of enterprises.  In the western countries much of this  capital is put behind establishing technology and expanding business or is used to help the evolution of new management teams.</p>
				<p><strong><em>Venture Funds in India</em></strong><br />
				  The venture fund or venture capital scheme is of recent origin in India. The following are some of the institutions which have  established venture funds in India:</p>
				<p><strong><em>(1) Risk  Capital Foundation of IFCI</em></strong><br />
				  The first venture fund in the name of Risk Capital Foundation was sponsored by the Industrial Finance Corporation of India  (IFCI) in March, 1975. It was re-constituted as  _Risk Capital and Technology Finance Corporation  Limited (RCTC) in January, 1988. At present RCTC  operates three schemes, viz., Risk Capital Scheme, Technology Finance and  Development Scheme and Venture Capital Unit Scheme. Under the first two schemes, the Corporation provides supplementary assistance to new entrepreneurs particularly technologists and  professionals for promoting medium-size industrial  projects both in the form of rupee loans and  direct subscription to their share capital. While  under the Venture Capital Scheme the venture capital fund of Rs. 30 crores (Rs. 20 crores from <em>IFCI </em>and Rs. 10 crores from  the World Bank) was set up in July, 1991. The  aim of the scheme is to provide venture capital  for potentially highly profitable ventures involving innovative products/technology/service aimed at futuristic or new markets.</p>
				<p><strong><em> (2) Venture Fund </em></strong><strong><em>of IDBI</em></strong><br />
				  The Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBn also started venture capital scheme in 1986. </p>
				<p><strong><em>(3) Venture Capital Fund </em></strong><strong><em>of SIDBI</em></strong><br />
				  The Small Industries  Development Bank of India <em>(SIDBI) </em>has also set up a venture capital fund with an initial corpus  of Rs.10 crores during the  year 1992-93. The fund is exclusively meant for providing financial assistance for innovative ventures in  small-scale sector.</p>
				<p><strong><em>(4) Venture Capital Fund of Technology Development and Infrastructure Corporation of India (TDICI)</em></strong><br />
				  The corporation has been set up by Industrial Credit Investment Corporation of  India <em>(ICICI) </em>for providing technology  information and financing commercial research and development schemes. It also manages the venture capital fund  of Rs. 30 crores which <em>ICICI </em>had established  along with in 1988.</p>
				<p><strong><em> (5) Other Venture Capital Funds</em></strong><br />
				  Besides the public financial institutions <em>(IDBI, IFCI, ICICI </em>and <em>SIDBI), </em>as discussed above, certian banks, viz., State Bank of India,  Canada Bank and Grindlays Bank have also set  up venture capital funds. The State  Bank of India has set up the venture capital fund  through its subsidiary <em>SBI </em>Capital  Markets Limited. Canara Bank has also set up a venture capital fund  through its subsidiary Canbank Financial Services  Limited. Grindlays Bank has also launched India Investment Fund. The funds are raised from <em>NRIs </em>abroad.  It is going to provide venture finance to suitable projects out of this  fund.<br />
				  In the private  sector, the Credit Capital Corportation has set up the Credit Capital Venture Fund India Ltd. The  Corporation intends to involve multinational bodies like Asian Development Bank and Commonwealth Fund in its financing.</p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Guidelines for Venture Capital Fund Companies</strong><br />
				  The Government of India announced on November 25, 1989 certain guidelines  regarding establishment and functioning of Venture Capital Funds Companies. These  guidelines were found to be restrictive and were repealed on 25-7-1995. The new guidelines for functioning of Venture Capital Fund in the  country were announced by SEBI on 4th December, 1996.
