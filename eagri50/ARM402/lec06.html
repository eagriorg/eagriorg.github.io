				<p><strong>Entrepreneurial management</strong> requires  policies and practices in four major areas</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The organizations must be made  more <strong>receptive to innovation</strong> and willing to perceive change as an  opportunity rather than threat. Policies and practices are needed to create  such an entrepreneurial climate within the organization. </li>
			    </ul>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Systematic measurement or  appraisal of company’s performance</strong> as entrepreneur  and innovator is mandatory as well as built in learning process to improve  performance. </li>
			    </ul>
				<ul>
				  <li>Entrepreneurial management  requires <strong>specific practices pertaining to organizational structure</strong> to  staffing and managing and to compensation, incentives and rewards. </li>
			    </ul>
				<ul>
				  <li>There are <strong>don’t things</strong> that are not to be done in an entrepreneurial management. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>I. Receptiveness of Organizations to Innovation - </strong><strong>Entrepreneurial policies</strong> <br />
				  Specific  entrepreneurial policies are required to make innovation as a part and parcel  of the ordinary, the norm to address the following reasons. </p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Innovation must be made more       attractive and beneficial to managers rather than holding on to what       already exists. </li>
				  <li>There must be clear understanding       inside the organization that innovation is the best means to preserve and       perpetuate the organization and that it is the foundation for individual       managers’ job security and success. </li>
				  <li>Importance of the need for       innovation and dimensions of its time frame must be both defined and       spelled out. </li>
				  <li>There needs to be an innovation       plan with specific objectives laid out.</li>
			    </ol>
				<br clear="all" />
                <p><strong>Receptive to  innovation - Policy Implementation at Organization level</strong></p>
                <p>A. As a first step, every three years or so, the enterprise must put  every single product, process, technology, market, distributive channel on  trial for its life. </p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Innovation requires a major       effort. It requires hard work on the part of performing, capable people,       the scarcest resource in any organization </li>
                  <li>To allow innovating, the business       has to be able to free its best performers for the challenges of       innovation</li>
                  <li>Equally the enterprise has to be       able to devote financial resources to innovation</li>
                  <li>If the company executives clearly       know that they have to innovate or get abandoned, they would be motivated       to innovate by turning themselves in to entrepreneurs - A form of organizational hygiene<strong></strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>B. The second step is to face up the fact that all existing  products, services, markets, distribution channels, processes, technologies  have limited and usually short health and life expectancies.</p>
                <p>C. The enterprise should be continuously diagnosed which requires  judgment, knowledge of the business, products markets, customers, its  technologies and experience.  This kind  of analysis may be termed as business X-ray.   Business X-ray is a tool for decision making. It enables us and forces  us to allocate resources to results in the existing business. It also makes  possible for us to determine how much is needed to create the business of  tomorrow and its new products, new services and new markets. It enables us to  turn innovative intention to innovative performance. <br />
                  The Business X-ray furnishes the information needed to  define how much innovation a given business requires, in what areas within what  time frame. </p>
                <p><strong>Michael Kamis Approach</strong><br />
                  The company lists  each of its products, services, the markets that each serves, the distribution  channel it uses, in order to estimate their position on the product life cycle.  This enables the company to estimate where to confine itself and shows the gap  between what can be expected realistically and what a company still needs to do  to achieve its objectives in sales, market share or profitability. <br />
                  Finally the one  thing certain about any major innovative effort is that there are going to be  last minute hitches and last minute delays. </p>
                <p><strong>D. Systematic  Abandonment  </strong><br />
                  The Business X ray  and the definition of innovation gap and innovation need altogether help the  company to formulate an entrepreneurial plan with objectives of innovation and  deadlines. <br />
                  Such a plan ensures  that the budget for innovation is adequate and it determines how many people  are needed with what abilities and capacities. The people are provided with  tools, money and the information to work on the innovation with clear  deadlines. <br />
                  There are the  fundamental policies needed to endow a business with entrepreneurial management;  to make the business and its management greedy for new things, to make the  business to perceive innovation as a healthy normal, necessary course of  action. </p>
                <p><strong>Receptive to innovation - </strong><strong>Entrepreneurial Practices</strong><br />
                  Entrepreneurship in the existing business also requires managerial  practices. </p>
                <p>1. Focusing managerial vision on opportunity </p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>People only see what is presented       to them and what is not presented gets overlooked. </li>
                  <li>What are presented to most       managers are problems like areas where performance falls below       expectations. </li>
                  <li>Management even in small companies       gets a report on operating performance once a month which lists,</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Areas in which performance has fallen below budget</li>
                    <li>Areas in which there are problems.</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>The operating report should have       two “first pages” The traditional one must list the areas of poor       performance and problems the other one list all the areas in which       performance was better than expected, budgeted or planned for. </li>
                  <li>The unexpected successes in ones       own business is a symptom of innovative opportunity. </li>
                  <li>Typically in companies that are       managed for entrepreneurship there are two meetings on operating results.       One to focus on the problems and the other one to focus on opportunities. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>2.  The other practice is to  hold a two day management meeting for all executives. The top performing  executives are made to present before the group their achievements and the  measures that have been required to achieve it. The opportunities are also  explained. This has a huge impact on the attitude and values of other  executives to plan and execute opportunities and to be more enterprising and  successful. <br />
                  Entrepreneurial  companies always look for the people and units that do better and do  differently. They single them out, feature them and constantly ask them </p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>What are you doing that explains       your success?</li>
                  <li>What are you doing that the rest       of us are not doing?</li>
                  <li>What are you not doing that the       rest of us are doing?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>3. The third practice in a large company is organizing a session  where a member of top management group sits down with junior people from  research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing so on, to listen to them on  their personal aspirations, opportunities for the company and any possible  threats. This gives the seniors badly needed insights in to the values, vision  and concern of their younger colleagues. Above all these sessions are one of  the most effective ways to instill entrepreneurial visions throughout the  company. </p>
                <p><strong>II. Measuring innovative  performance </strong><br />
                  In the normal  assessments of a business, innovative performance is conspicuous by its  absence. </p>
                <ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>The first step is to build       suitable mechanisms for feed back of expectations and results from each       innovative project</li>
                  <li>The second step is to develop a       systematic review of innovative efforts altogether </li>
                  <li>The efforts that need more       attention, more resources, emerging new opportunities, the not really       improving areas and the meeting of deadlines for the efforts could be       documented and discussed. </li>
                  <li>Entrepreneurial management entails       the company’s total innovative performance against the company’s       innovative objectives, against its performance and standing in the market,       and against its performance as a business altogether. </li>
                </ol>
