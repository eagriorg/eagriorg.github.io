				</p>
				<p><strong>1. Business entity concept</strong><br />
The business is viewed as a distinctly different and  independent of the owner and is to be viewed as an entity on its own. This  means that the business transactions are to be recorded and the factors of the  dual aspect are to be determined from the point of the view of the business.  This means even in the case of a sole trader the owners transactions are to be  recorded as if it is from any other person like.<br />
<strong>2. Going concern concept</strong><br />
The business transactions are to be recorded on the  basic assumption that the business will be there for a longer period and will  not necessarily come to end at the close of the accounting period. This  necessitates the classification of the transactions as both Capital and  Revenue. To put in simple terms, if the transactions relates to the accounting  period only, it may be classified as <em>Revenue</em> whereas in all other cases  generally they may be classified as <em>Capital</em>. For example, <em>Lease </em>rent  payments give benefits only during the month, the same is to be treated as the  revenue whereas the Lease advance, the benefit of such payment being available  during the entire tenure of the lease is to be classified as Capital. This  distinction is very much important to determine the financial performance and  to ascertain the correct financial position of a business from the financial  records.<br />
<strong>3. Money measurement concept</strong><br />
The accounting system attempts to record those  transactions which are expressed in terms of money or money’s worth.  This means that those transactions which are  of subjective nature however worth they may be from the point of view of the  business will not be recorded. For instance, a small payment of wages may be  recorded whereas the adverse effect of a government policy on the labour cost  will not be recorded.</p>
				<p><strong>4.  Accounting period concept</strong><br />
				  Even thought the business is assumed to exist  indefinitely in terms of the going concern concept, it is customary to study  the financial performance and the financial position at regular intervals as a  measure of control. Such operational results studied at regular intervals are  generally referred as accounting periods.    Normally, a period of 12 months is considered to be the accounting  period by the accountants and each business may adopt their accounting period  to suit their needs.  <br />
				  Thus, a Calendar year -- January to December, <br />
				  Financial year -- April to March, <br />
				  or any other period like academic year, oil year, sugar year may be  adopted as the accounting year comprising of 12 months therein.<br />
				  <strong>5. Cost Concept</strong><br />
				  All business transactions will be recorded on the basis  of the costs and not on the basis of its value to the business even though it  may be important from the point of the business.  <br />
				  <strong>6. Revenue realization concept</strong><br />
				  Accounts record only such revenues which are actually  realised or there arises a legal right has accrued to the business to receive  the same. <br />
				  <strong>7. Full disclosure concept</strong><br />
				  Accountants try to reveal the contents in the financial  statements in such a way that the true and fair position of the financial  performance and the financial position is revealed. The disclosure should be  such that the classification of the items are of intelligible nature to have a  correct assessment of the situation disclosed.<br />
				  <strong>8. Dual aspect concept</strong><br />
				  As referred earlier, the dual aspect of the transaction  – both the benefit receiving and the benefit giving aspect-- is to be recorded  following the accounting rules relating to the various types of accounts.<br />
				  <strong>9. Matching concept</strong><br />
			    The accounts are to be recorded in such a way that if  any income is recorded, the expenditure relating to the same is also recorded  to find out a true financial results.   Vice-versa holds good in relation to the recording of the expenditures.</p>
				<h2><strong>Accounting  conventions</strong></h2>
				<p>Besides the above accounting concepts, the accountants  should also bear in mind the following accounting conventions for the  maintenance of the accounting system</p>
				
				<ul>
				  <li><strong><em>Convention of Disclosure</em></strong>: The accounts are to disclose all material particulars so that a  rational judgement may be made of the financial position and financial  performance.  For example, the  particulars relating to the aging of the debtors will give a better idea about  the possible realization thereof.   Since  accounting is an art, what is to be disclosed depends upon the circumstances of  the business.  Disclosure should comply  with the legal requirements related thereto.</li>
				  <li><strong><em>Convention of Materiality</em></strong>: The accounts are to be recorded in consideration with the material  aspects involved. Materiality refers to the factors that are relevant for the  purpose of giving knowledge to the users of the data so that they may have a  better understanding of the financial statements on their hand.</li>
				  <li><strong>Convention of Consistency</strong>: It is important that the accounts are to be drawn on the basis of  the accepted accounting policies and there should not be any deviation from it  year or after year. This means that accountants have to follow the policies  consistently throughout the business life of the organisation to enable the  users of the data to have knowledge about the business.</li>
				  <li><strong>Convention of Conservatism</strong>: The accountants always have the practice of conservatism as  hallmark in the preparation of the financial statements. This means that the  losses will be accounted at the earliest and the incomes will be recorded only  when they get a definite right over the receipts. <br />
