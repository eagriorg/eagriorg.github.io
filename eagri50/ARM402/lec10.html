                  <map name="Map" id="Map2">
                    <area shape="rect" coords="1,1,168,30" href="index.html" alt="" />
                  </map>
				</p>
				<p><strong>Macro environment</strong></p>
				<p>            It may broadly be  classified into (1) Economic environment, (2) Demographic environment, (3)  Socio-cultural environment, (4) Technological environment (5) Political  environment, and (6) Legal environment </p>
				<p><strong>1.   Economic Environment</strong></p>
				<p>            Economic  environment is the most significant component of the marketing environment. It  affects the success of a firm. The economic environmental forces can be studied  under three broad categories: (a) General economic conditions (b) Industrial  conditions, and (c) State of supply of resources for production.<br />
                    <strong><em>a.  General Economic  Conditions</em></strong><br />
				  General economic conditions in a country are influenced  by various factors. The following factors are important.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Agricultural trends</li>
				  <li>Industrial output trends</li>
				  <li>Per capita income trends</li>
				  <li>Pattern of income distribution</li>
				  <li>Pattern of savings and  expenditures</li>
				  <li>Price levels</li>
				  <li>Employment trends</li>
				  <li>Impact of government policies  and</li>
				  <li>Economic systems </li>
			    </ul>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong><em>Industrial Conditions</em></strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Economic environment of a country is influenced by the  prevalent industrial conditions as well as industrial policies of a country. A  Manager needs to pay attention to the following aspects of the industrial  conditions.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Market growth of the industry</li>
				  <li>Demand patterns of the industry,  and</li>
				  <li>Its stage in product life cycle</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong><em>State of Supply of  Resources for Production</em></strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p>            Supply of resources  required for production determines inputs which are available for production.  These are the most important resources required for production.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Land</li>
				  <li>Labour</li>
				  <li>Capital</li>
				  <li>Machinery and equipment, and </li>
				  <li>Managers </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>The above-stated environmental forces determine the  economic environment of a country. <br />
				  To sum up, economic environment describes the overall  economic situation in country and helps in analysing GNP per capita, rate of  economic growth, inflation rate, interest rates, unemployment problems, etc.  Therefore it is necessary to examine carefully the economic environment of the  country.</p>
				<p><strong>2.   Demographic  environment</strong></p>
				<p>            Demographic  environment explains the pattern and changes in the society based on age, sex,  educational background, marital status, family size, family life style,  religion, nationality, etc. Demographic environment is useful for marketing  decisions, market segmentation and formulation of marketing strategies.  Knowledge of the demographic environment is very important to a marketer for  performance of his functions. People constitute the market and market depends  on customers. Demography provides quantitative as well as qualitative aspects  of population. </p>
				<p><strong>3.   Socio-cultural environment</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>The social environment of a  nation determines the value system of the society which in turn affects the  marketing of products. Social factors are caste. Customs, conventions, cultural  heritage and respect for seniority, etc. For example, the nature of goods and  services in demand depends upon people's attitudes, customs, social values,  etc. In India, social environment is continuously changing.<br />
				  Changing social values and increased acceptance of  improved birth control methods have resulted in a rise in the mean age of  various countries. The social environment has the following dimensions.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Changes in people's lifestyles</li>
				  <li>Concerns for social problems  and</li>
				  <li>Growth of consumerism</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>            Culture influences  every aspect of marketing. Marketing decisions are based on recognition of  needs and wants of the customers, which is a function of customer’s  perceptions. These help in understanding of lifestyles and behaviour patterns  as they have grown in the society's culture in which the individual has been  groomed. Thus a person's perspective is generated, groomed and conditioned by  culture.</p>
				<p><strong>4. Technological environment:</strong> Technological  environment provides both opportunities and threats, and its impact is direct  as well as indirect. Certain aspects to which a marketing planner should pay  attention are;</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>High expenditure on research  and development</li>
				  <li>Concentration on product  improvement and development</li>
				  <li>Unlimited innovations in  technology</li>
				  <li>Accelerating pace of  technological change and</li>
				  <li>Greater emphasis upon the  regulation of technological change</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>            Advances in  technology are difficult to predict. However, the manager should consider  potential, technological development determined from resources committed by  major industries or the government. Being in a market that is rapidly changing  due to technological development, will require the manager to make careful  short-term marketing decisions as well as being prepared with contingency plans  given any new technological developments that may affect product or services.</p>
				<p><strong>5. Political environment: </strong>Political factors play a major role in shaping the  environment in which business organizations operate. Thus a business  organization has to attempt to study and analyse political environment. Such a  study and analysis help in estimating risks opportunities and threats involved,  and then adjusting their decisions and operations to anticipated changes.<br />
			    To conclude, the various political factors that should be considered  are;</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Role of private sector in the  economy</li>
				  <li>Government procedures and  changes in government policy</li>
				  <li>Type of government and  stability in government</li>
				  <li>Role of small-scale industry in  the economy and </li>
				  <li>Role of service sector in the  economy</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>6. Legal environment: </strong>Decisions are strongly affected by laws pertaining to competition,  price setting, distribution arrangements, advertising, etc. It is necessary for  a manager to understand the legal environment of the country and the  jurisdiction of its courts. The following laws affecting business in India are  important.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Indian Contract Act, 1872</li>
				  <li>Factories Act, 1948</li>
				  <li>Minimum Wages Act, 1948</li>
				  <li>Essential Commodities Act, 1955</li>
				  <li>Food Products Order</li>
				  <li>Securities contracts Regulation  Act, 1956 (Now replaced by SEBI Act)</li>
				  <li>The Companies Act, 1956</li>
				  <li>Trade and Merchandise Marks  Act, 1958</li>
				  <li>Monopolies and Restrictive  Trade Practices Act, 1969</li>
				  <li>The Water (Prevention and  Control of Pollution) Act, 1974</li>
				  <li>The Air (Prevention and Control  of pollution ) Act, 1981</li>
				  <li>Sick Industrial Companies  (Special provision) act, 1985</li>
				  <li>Environment Protection Act,  1986</li>
				  <li>Consumer Protection Act, 1986</li>
				  <li>Securities and Exchange Board  of India Act, 1992</li>
				  <li>Taxation laws covering  Corporate tax, indirect taxes like Excise, Customs, Sales tax and Wealth tax)</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Importance of Environment  Analysis</strong></p>
				<p>            The manager needs  to be dynamic to effectively deal with the challenges of environment. The  environment of business is not static. The some of the following benefits of  environment scanning are as follows:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>It creates an increased general  awareness of environmental changes on the part of management</li>
				  <li>It guides with greater  effectiveness in matters relating to Government </li>
				  <li>It helps in marketing analysis</li>
				  <li>It suggests improvements in  diversification and resource allocation</li>
				  <li>It helps firms to identify and  capitalise upon opportunities rather than losing out to competitors</li>
				  <li>It provides a base of objective  qualitative information about the business environment that can subsequently be  of value in designing the strategies.</li>
