				<p><strong>Entrepreneurship </strong><br />
The words entrepreneur, intrapreneur and  entrepreneurship have acquired special significance in the context of economic  growth in a rapidly changing socio-economic and socio-economic climates,  particularly in industry both in developed and developing countries. The  experience in the industrialized countries like the United States of America,  Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom are authoritatively cited in support of  this claim. An in-depth study of the subject thus becomes not only relevant but  also necessary. Entrepreneurial development is a complex phenomenon. Productive  activity undertaken by him and constant endeavor to sustain and improve it are  the outward expression of this process of development of his personality.  Such process is crystallization of social  milieu from which he comes, family imbibes, make-up of his mind, personal  attitudes, caste system, educational level parental occupation, and so on. An  entrepreneur is one of the important segments of economic-growth. Basically he  is a person responsible for setting up a business or an enterprise. In fact, he  is one who has the initiative skill for innovation and who looks for high  achievements. He is a catalytic agent of change and works for the good of  people. He puts-up new green­ projects that creates wealth open up many  employment opportunities and leads to the growth of other sectors. </p>
				<p><strong>How can I decide if I have the  needed entrepreneurship? </strong> <br />
				  You  can assess your business skills by evaluating past jobs, volunteer work,  positions in organizations, and personal traits. Consider your experiences and  qualifications under each of the following headings. </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Organization and planning: setting and attaining goals,  managing time commitments, and keeping work schedules. </li>
			    </ol>
				<ol>
				  <li>Handling money: determining budgets, securing loans, raising  funds, keeping financial records, and completing income tax forms. </li>
				  <li>Selling ideas and products: determining sales quotas and  projections; presenting projects for committees, organizations and/or  administrative groups; direct selling to customers or clientele; handling  criticism and rejection. </li>
				  <li>Management: experience in managing all or part of a small  business or an agency; serving as director or major officer of an organization. </li>
				  <li>Working with people: mediating or arbitrating between people  with opposing views when the situation requires; organizing and planning large  public events; assuming officer or executive secretary positions in an  organization, and/or handling complaints for an organization or company;  getting along well with most people. </li>
				  <li>Ability to take risks: taking moderate, calculated risks in  varied situations (situations where the chance of winning was not so small as  to be a “gamble” or so large as to be a “sure thing” situations where there was  a reasonable and challenging chance of success). </li>
				  <li>Willingness to lead and to work alone: being  self-disciplined; handling situations which were ambiguous and full of  uncertainty as to the job requirements; working calmly and efficiently in the  midst of an emergency or crisis. </li>
				  <li>Personality traits: taking the initiative in situations  requiring it; accepting and accomplishing more than your share of the work;  willingness to work hard even if the financial rewards are slow in coming;  establishing high standards of performance and raising them once they are met. </li>
				  <li>Knowledge of products and/or skills in the service offered by  your business or in producing your product: willingness to do self-study,  research, and planning to improve business operations. </li>

                  <p><strong>Do I need all these skills? </strong><br />
                    Not all of these  experiences are necessary for every business. Few, if any, persons who start a  business are experts at everything. You must be able to assess your strengths  and weaknesses before deciding whether you can take time to learn what you need  to know, or can afford to hire staff or consultants. Expertise is more  important in some businesses than in others. Only you can assess whether you  have the right expertise to succeed. </p>
                </div>
                <br clear="all" />
                <div>
                  <p><strong>How can I assess my skills for  entrepreneurship? </strong><br />
                    Make a list of your  work experiences, hobbies, interests, and acquired skills. You are preparing  your own “resume” so be careful not to exaggerate or deceive yourself about  things on this list. Be honest and objective. After completing the list, it  should be fairly evident what you can bring to your new business and where your  interests lie. Keep this inventory available and use it when selecting the type  of business you will launch. </p>
                  <p><strong>What kind of Enterprises should I  start? </strong><br />
                    What are the kinds of businesses you might  consider starting? Make a list of ones you could consider, eliminating only  those that are obviously not for you. Rule out ones that require talents and  skills you did not list when you prepared your “resume” and ones in which you  have no interest. You may have an original idea for a business that no one has  considered or for a product that doesn’t exist. Try not to limit your thinking  only to this new business or product. To do this you must gather information.  Evaluate your idea against other possibilities. </p>
                  <p><strong>What are some possible sources of  information? </strong><br />
                    You  might try one or more of the following sources for information: <br />
                    •      Telephone yellow pages can indicate what  is and is not available in your area. <br />
                    •      Public libraries have a number of business  directories, including the Thomas <br />
                    Register. <br />
                    •      Entrepreneurial magazines often have  articles about new business ideas that have <br />
                    Potential. <br />
                    •      Ask friends, coworkers, neighbors, and  relatives if they have product or service <br />
                    needs that is not currently being met. </p>
                </div>
                <br clear="all" />
                <p><strong>What are some strategies for  making a decision? </strong> <br />
                  After considering business ideas on your  list, narrow down the possibilities. To complete the selection process, talk  with people in the same or a similar business who are located outside of the  area where you are considering locating your business. Let them know that you  would value their advice. Usually they will be flattered and willing to share  their experience and advice. Another strategy involves checking success and  failure reports. You can find this type of information at most public  libraries. Ask for professional advice. There are four professionals you  should get to know early in your business planning: an attorney, accountant, marketing  consultant, and banker. Share your plans with them. They may point out factors  you hadn’t yet considered. Share your thoughts with your family, friends, and  associates. They may come up with considerations that may discourage you from  one idea, or they may offer real encouragement for pursuing another idea.  Having the support and involvement of those close to you can be an added  benefit. Make the final decision yourself. If you can answer, “yes” to all four  of the following questions, you are ready to make a commit­ment: </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Does the business satisfy most of my wants  and desires? (business selection criteria) <br />
                    </li>
                  <li>Do I have, or can I develop (or hire), the  attributes and capabilities that are required for success in this business? <br />
                    </li>
                  <li>Is the current condition and outlook for  this type of business favorable? <br />
                    </li>
                  <li>Am I, and is my family, willing to accept  the risks that will accompany my starting the proposed business?<br />
                    </li>
                  <li>If  the answer to question four is “no,” you might want to consider your proposed  business ownership more carefully before proceeding. If you can answer, “yes”  to two of the first three, you may need to rely on your instincts. Remember,  there is probably no perfect business. You will undoubtedly be making  compromises no matter what you choose.</li>
