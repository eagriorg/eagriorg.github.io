				<p align="left"><strong>Financial feasibility</strong><strong> </strong></p>
				<p>A food processing firm would like to expand  the existing business or modernize the same or establish new business. Such  ventures necessitate the firm to commit large amount of funds in creation of  fixed assets in the current year or within few years, which will generate cash  flows during many future periods. Investment decisions pertaining to creation  of additional fixed assets or modernizing the old areas are generally known as  Capital Budgeting or Capital Expenditure decisions. <br />
				  Capital budgeting decisions may be  defined as the firm’s decision to invest its current funds most efficiently on  long-term assets in anticipation of an expected flow of benefits over a period  of time. Investment in the long term assets invariably required funds to be  tied up in the current assets such as inventories. The investment decisions  require special attention because i) they influence the growth in the long run,  ii) it may reduce or increase risk in business, iii) it is necessary to arrange  huge funds internally or externally, iv) most investment decisions are  irreversible or the firm will incur heavy losses if decisions are reversed, and  v) the investments decisions are made based on the assumptions about cash flow  in future.<br />
				  The capital budgeting techniques may  be grouped in to following categories;<br />
				  i)  Discounted techniques<br />
				  ii)  Undiscounted techniques<br />
				  The major difference between these  two measures is based on consideration of   time value of money. Investment decisions involving expansion <br />
				  or modernization of existing business or  venturing into new business involves utilization of funds for creation of  assets in a year or few years, which will generate cash flows during many  future periods.<br />
  <strong>Time Value of Money</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Interest rate serves as the  pricing mechanism for the time value of money. The rate of interest is  considered as an exchange price between the present and future rupees. Thus one  rupee today exchanges for (1+ i) rupees at the end of period one in future. Or  alternatively a one rupee payment made at a period in the future exchanges for  1/1 +i rupees now. <br />
  <strong>Compounding </strong>is the process of finding future  value of present amount</p>

				<p><img src="005" /></p>
				<p>&nbsp; </p>
				<p><strong>The effects of time  and interest on present and future values:</strong><br />
The  important variables determining present and future values of payment are:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>The number of conversion periods and</li>
				  <li>The size of interest rate per compounding period</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Discounted  Measures</strong></p>
				<p>In  discounted measures of investment analysis the time value of money is taken  into consideration. Following are the discounted measure of investment  analysis.<br />
				  i)          Net present worth or value (NPV or  NPW)</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Benefit cost ratio (BCR)</li>
				  <li>Internal rate of return (IRR)   </li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Discounting factor</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>In calculation of net present  worth or benefit cost ratio, discounting factor must be chosen prior to  investment analysis. Usually the discounting factor used is the opportunity  cost of capital. The bank rate given on long term deposit (12%) is chosen as  the discount factor,(alternatively, the entrepreneurs instead of investing in  the proposed investment can deposit in a bank and earn 12% of interest).<br />
                    <strong>i) Net present worth</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>This is the present worth of  incremental net benefit or incremental cash flow stream. It is interpreted as  the present worth of the income stream generated by an investment.</p>
				<p><img src="006" /></p>
				<p><strong>Selection  criterion</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Accept all independent projects  with a zero or greater net present worth when discounted at opportunity cost of  capital. Ranking of acceptable alternative independent project is not possible  with net present worth criterion because it is an absolute and not a relative  measure. It is also the preferred selection criterion to choose among mutually  exclusive project.<strong>    </strong></p>
				<p><strong>ii) Benefit Cost Ratio</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>This is the ratio of present  worth of benefit stream to present worth of cost stream. </p>
				<p><img src="007" /></p>
				<p><strong>Selection criterion</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Accept all independent projects  with a benefit cost ratio of 1 or greater when the cost and benefit streams are  discounted at opportunity cost of capital.<br />
                  <strong>iii) Internal Rate of Return  (IRR)</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>In NPW and BC ratio, market rate  of interest is chosen and the project is assessed whether it is rewarding at  this standard (interest). The IRR is a method to assess the maximum interest  that the investment could generate for the resources used. <br />
            Internal rate of return is that  discount rate which makes the net present worth of incremental net benefit  equal to zero. </p>
