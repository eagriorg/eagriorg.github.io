				<p><strong>I. According to  the Type of Business </strong><br />
				  Entrepreneurs are found in various types of business  coronations of varying size. We may broadly classify them as follows: <br />
  <strong>Business Entrepreneur: </strong><br />
				  Business entrepreneurs are individuals who conceive an  idea for a new product or service and-then creates a business to materialize  their idea into reality. They tap both production and marketing’ resources in  their search to develop a new business opportunity. They may set up a .big  establishment or a small business unit. They are called small business  entrepreneurs when found in  small  business units such as printing press, textile processing house, advertising  agency; readymade garments, or confectionery. In a majority of cases, entrepreneurs  are found in small trading and manufacturing business and entrepreneurship  flourishes when the size of the business is small. <br />
  <strong>Trading Entrepreneur: </strong><br />
				  Trading entrepreneur is one who undertakes trading  activities and is not concerned with the manufacturing work. He identifies  potential markets, stimulates demand for his product line and creates a desire  and interest among buyers to go in for his product. He is engaged in both  domestic and overseas trade. Britain, due to geographical limitations, has  developed trade through trading entrepreneurs. These entrepreneurs demonstrate  their ability in pushing many ideas ahead to promote their business. <br />
  <strong>Industrial Entrepreneur:</strong><br />
				  Industrial  entrepreneur is essentially a manufacturer, who identifies the potential needs  of customers and tailors a product or service to meet the marketing needs. He  is a product-oriented man who starts in an industrial unit because of the  possibility of making some new product. The entrepreneur has the ability to  convert economic resources and technology into a considerably profitable  venture. He is found in industrial units as the electronic industry, textile  units, machine tools or videocas­sette tape factory and the like. </p>
				<p><strong>Corporate Entrepreneur: </strong><br />
				  Corporate entrepreneur is a person .who demonstrates his  innovative skill in organizing and manag­ing corporate undertaking. A corporate  undertaking is a form of business’ organization, which is registered under some  statute or Act, which gives it a separate legal entity. A trust registered  under the Trust Act, or companies registered under the Companies Act are  example of corporate undertakings. A corporate entrepreneur is thus an  individual who plans, develops and manages a corporate body. <br />
  <strong>Agricultural Entrepreneur: </strong><br />
				  Agricultural entrepreneurs are those entrepreneurs who  undertake agricultural activities as raising and marketing of crops,  fertilisers and other inputs of agriculture. They are motivated to raise  agriculture through mechanization, irrigation and application of technologies  for dry land agriculture products. They cover a broad spectrum of the  agricultural sector and include its allied occupations. </p>
				<p><strong>II. According to the Technology use</strong><br />
				  The application of new technology in various succors of  the national economy is essential for the future growth of business. We may  broadly classify these. entrepreneurs on the basis of the use of technology as  follows: <br />
  <strong>Technical Entrepreneur: </strong><br />
				  A technical entrepreneur is essentially compared to a  “craftsman.” He develops improved quality of goods because of his  craftsmanship. He concentrates more on production than marketing. On not much  sales generation by and does not do various sales promotional techniques. He  demon­strates his innovative capabilities in matter of production of goods and  rendering of services. The greatest strength, which the technical entrepreneur  has, is his skill in production techniques. <br />
  <strong>Non-technical Entrepreneur: </strong><br />
				  Non-technical entrepreneurs are those who are not  concerned with the technical aspects of the product in which they deal. They  are concerned only with developing alternative marketing and distribution  strategies to promote their business. <br />
  <strong>Professional Entrepreneur: </strong><br />
				  Professional entrepreneur is a person who is interested  in establishing a business, but does not have interest in managing or operating  it once it is established. A professional entrepreneur sells out the running  business and starts another venture with the sales proceeds. Such an entrepre­neur  is dynamic and he conceives new ideas to develop alternative projects. <br />
  <strong>III. According to the Entrepreneur and Motivation </strong><br />
				  Motivation is the force that influences the efforts of  the entrepreneur to achieve his objectives. An entrepreneur is motivated to  achieve or prove his excellence in job performance. He is also motivated to  influence others by demonstrating his business acumen. <br />
  <strong>Pure Entrepreneur</strong><br />
				  A pure entrepreneur is an individual who is motivated by  psychological and economic rewards. He undertakes an entrepreneurial activity  for his personal satisfaction in work, ego or status. <br />
  <strong>Induced Entrepreneur</strong><br />
				  Induced entrepreneur is one who is  induced to take up an entrepreneurial task due to the policy measures of the  government that provides assistance, Incentives, concessions and necessary  overhead, facilities to start a venture. Most of the induced entrepreneurs  enter business due to financial, technical and several other facilities  provided to them by the state agencies to promote entrepreneurship. A person  with a sound project is provided package assistance to his project. Today,  import restriction and allocation to production quotas to mall units have  induced many people to start a small-scale industry. <br />
  <strong>Motivated Entrepreneur</strong><br />
				  New entrepreneurs are motivated by  the desire for self-fulfillment. They come into being because of the  possibility of making and marketing some new product for the use of consumers.  If the product is developed to a saleable stage, the entrepreneur is further  motivated by reward in terms of profit. <br />
  <strong>Spontaneous Entrepreneur</strong> <br />
				  These entrepreneurs start their  business their by Entrepreneur. They are persons with initiative, boldness and  confidence in their_- ability, which activate, them, underage entrepreneurial  activity. Such entrepreneurs have a strong conviction and confidence in their  inborn ability.<br />

				<p>The development of a new venture has a greater chance of  success. The entrepreneurs a new and open field of business. The customer’s  approval to the new product gives them psychological satisfaction and enormous  profit. The industrial units are identified as units of high growth, medium  growth and low growth industries and as such we have “Growth Entrepreneur” and  “Super-Growth Entrepreneur.” <br />
                    <strong>Growth Entrepreneur</strong>: <br />
				  Growth entrepreneurs are those who necessarily take up a  high growth industry, which has substantial growth prospects. <br />
  <strong>Super-Growth Entrepreneur</strong>:<br />

  <strong>VI. Others </strong><br />
				  Innovating entrepreneurship is characterized by  aggressive assemblage in information and analysis of results, deriving from a  novel combination of factors. Men / women in this group are generally  aggressive in experimentation who exhibit cleverness in putting attractive  possibilities into practice. One need not invent but convert even old  established products or services by changing their utility, their value, and  their economic characteristics into something new, attractive and utilitarian.  Therein lies the key to their phenomenal success. Such an entrepreneur is one  who sees the opportunity for introducing a new technique of production process  or a new commodity or a new market or a new service or even the reorganization  of an existing enterprise.</p>
