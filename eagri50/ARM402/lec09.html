				<p>Most of successful companies have now realized that firms encounter  a never ending series of opportunities and threats. The responsibility for  identifying significant changes in the macro-environment falls on company's  decision makers. Managers should realise that environmental scanning would  provide a continuous link between them, their customers and others in the  environment. A Manager has to design his marketing strategies based on the  emerging marketing environment. </p>
				<p><strong>            </strong>The marketing environment can  be classified as micro environment and macro environment. Micro environment  includes all elements which have greater interaction with the firm and those  that could be influenced by the firm’s policies. The macro environment includes  all elements that have an indirect influence on the performance of the company.</p>
				<p><strong>Micro Environment</strong></p>
				<p>            The micro  environment comprises of  suppliers (raw  materials or finished goods to the firm), the firm, intermediaries, customers  and publics. </p>
				<p><img src="003" /></p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Suppliers</strong>: the suppliers include raw  material and other inputs or finished goods suppliers to the firm. The  performance of the suppliers can influences the success of the firm to a  greater extent.  Delay in delivery of  supplies, supply of low quality inputs, high cost of inputs, irregularity in  supply of inputs would affect the production of the firm.  Therefore every firm must build good  relations with their suppliers so that both of them benefit in the long  run.  The firm may provide technology,  capital, managerial assistance to the suppliers so that they can improve their  performance.</li>
				  <li><strong>Firm: </strong>The activities of the firm have a  direct bearing on the success of the firm.   The firm should have a customer orientation.  It should examine the needs of their  customers and then design their products and services such that they fulfill  the needs of the customers.  This would  enable greater customer satisfaction thereby increasing the number of loyal  customers.  This goodwill would enable  the firm to launch new products and services for the customers.  <strong></strong></li>
				  <li><strong>Intermediaries:  </strong>It includes distributors, retailers, advertising firms, market  research firms, etc.  The success of the  firm also depends on the role of the intermediaries.  The firm must build healthy relationship with  the intermediaries such that the firm and the intermediaries benefit in the  long run. <strong></strong></li>
				  <li><strong>Customers:</strong> They are the key element in  the micro environment.  In the  competitive market winning a customer is a difficult task for the firms.  Therefore they should formulate strategies to  fulfill the customer needs.  Customers  have varied taste and preferences hence the firm must monitor their changing  needs and capitalize them by providing suitable products and services.  </li>
			      <li><strong>Publics</strong>:  The publics  includes NGOs, consumer forums<strong> </strong>etc.  These organizations are there to protect the  interests of the customers and society.   The individuals can seek justice by approaching the publics. The publics  will also fight against the firms who produce controversial advertisement,  products that affect the society, environmental pollution etc.  </li>
