				<p><strong>Institutional – Organizational – Managerial aspects</strong></p>
				<p><strong>            </strong>A whole range of issues in  project preparation revolves around the overlapping institutional,  organizational and managerial aspects of projects, which clearly have an important  aspect on project implementation.<br />
				  One  group of questions asks whether the institutional setting of the project is  appropriate.  The sociocultural patterns  and institutions of those the project will serve must be considered.  Does the project design taken into account  the customs and culture of the farmers who will participate? Will the project  involve disruption of the ways in which farmers are accustomed to working? If  it does, what provisions are made to help them shift to new patterns?<br />
				  To  have a chance of being carried out, a project must relate properly to the  institutional structure of the country and region.  What will be the arrangements for land  tenure?  What size holding will be  encouraged?  Does the project incorporate  local institutions and use them to further the project?  How will the administrative organization of  the project relate to existing agencies?   Is there to be a separate project authority?<br />
				  The  organizational proposals should be examined to see that the project is  manageable.  Are authority and  responsibility properly linked?  Does the  organizational design encourage delegation of authority?  Does the proposed organization take proper  account of the customs and organizational procedures common in the country and  region.  Are ample provisions included  for managers and government supervisors to be obtaining up-to-date information  on the progress of the project?<br />
				  Managerial  issues are crucial to good project design and implementation.  The analyst must examine the ability of the  available staff to judge whether they can administers such large-scale public  sector activities as a complex water project, an extension service, or a credit  agency.  When managerial skills are  limited, provision may have to be made for training, especially of middle-level  personnel.</p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Social Aspects</strong></p>
				<p><strong>            </strong>We have mentioned the need for  analysts to consider the social patterns and practices of the clientele a  project will serve.  More and more  frequently, project analysts are also expected to examine carefully the broader  social implications of the proposed investments.  We have noted proposals to include weights  for income distribution in the formal analytical frame-work so that project  benefiting lower-income groups will be favoured.</p>
				<p><strong>Commercial Aspects</strong></p>
				<p><strong>            </strong>On the output side, careful  analysis of the proposed market for the project’s production is essential to  ensure that there will be an effective demand at a remunerative price.  Where will the products be sold? Is the market  large enough to absorb the new production without affecting the price?  If the price is likely to be affects, by how  much?  Will the project still be  financially viable at the new price?   What share of the total market will the proposed project supply?  Are there suitable facilities for handling  the new production?  Perhaps provision  should be included in the project for processing, or may be a separate  marketing project for processing and distribution is in order.  Is the product for domestic consumption or  for export?  Does the proposed project  product the grade or quality that the market demands?  What financing arrangements will be necessary  to market the output, and what special provisions need to be made in the  project to finance marketing?  Since the  product must be sold at market prices, a judgment about future government price  supports or subsidies may be in order.<br />
				  A  major objective of the financial analysis of farms is to judge how much farm  families participating in the project will have to live on.  The analyst will need budget projections that  estimate year by year future gross receipts and expenditures, including the  costs associated with production and credit repayments farm families must make,  to determine what remains to compensate the family for its own labour,  management skills, and capital.  Part of  the income the family will receive may in food that is consumed directly in the  household, so judgment must be about the quantity and its value.  Even if a family realize a considerable  increase in income or “net incremental benefits” by participating in the  project – as a result, say of borrowing to purchase fertilizers to increase  rice production – is absolute income may still be so low that nearly all of the  incremental production is consumed in the household.  Financial analysis must judge whether the  family will then have sufficient cash to repay the production credit for  fertilizer.  If not, the analyst may have  to make a policy judgment about how much to subsidies families with very low income.</p>
