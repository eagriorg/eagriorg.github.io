				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>METHODS OF ACCOUNTING</strong><br />
                    <strong>Single Entry System of  Book Keeping</strong><br />
				  The single entry system is  an incomplete method of Book Keeping. Under this system the cash Book and personal  ledgers only are maintained. <br />
				  i.e. Real and Nominal Account are not  maintained. One may not end accounts  relating to fixed assets, purchases, sales, expenses, incomes etc. Goods sold on credit will be recorded only in the account of  the customers concerned.<br />
				  Cash  received from him, will be recorded both in the cash account and in ie account of the customer. Purchase of machinery  on credit will not be corded at all  till payment is made.<br />
  <strong>Double Entry System of Book Keeping</strong><br />
				  This system was invented by an Italian named <u>LUCO</u> <u>PACIOLI in</u> 1494 .D.  According to this system, every transaction has got a two fold aspect. One is Benefit Receiving Aspect or Incoming aspect and the other one,  Benefit Receiving Aspect or Outgoing aspect. The benefit receiving  aspect is said to be Debit and the benefit  giving aspect is said to be a Credit. For every transaction one account is to be debited and another account  is to be credited i order to have a complete record of the same.  Therefore every transaction affects two  accounts in opposite direction.</p>

				<p>Entries will be made in opposite direction in these two  accounts. This system  is called Double Entry system since it keeps records in two accounts for every transaction.<br />
Therefore  the basic principle under this system is that for every debit there must be a  corresponding and equal credit and for every credit there must be a  corresponding and equal debit.</p>
				<p><strong>Accounting Principles</strong></p>
				<p>The generally accepted accounting principles are the set  of rules, concepts and guidelines used in preparing financial accounting  reports. The accounting  principles are described by various terms such as concept convector doctrines, assumptions, postulates etc., All  these are synonymous except the concepts  and conventions.		</p>
				<p><img width="488" height="216" src="lec24_clip_image002_0000.jpg" alt="12_Pic2" /></p>
				<p>There are  two approaches for the applications of Debit and Credit rules. 1. American  approach 2. English Approach In American approach the transactions are divided  into five categories.<br />
                  <strong>                              Debit                </u></strong><strong> Credit</strong><br />
1. Capital         Decrease          Increase<br />
2. Liability         Decrease          Increase<br />
3. Asset            Increase            Decrease<br />
4. Expenses    Increase           Decrease<br />
