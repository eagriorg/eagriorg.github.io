                  <p><strong>Introduction </strong> <br />
                    The selection criteria  of a proper form of organisation is crucial for the success of  business enterprise. Every entrepreneur has  to decide, at the outset, about the type of organisation, which he plans to  select for his private enterprise. Its unimportant entrepreneurial decision.  This choice is by and large influenced by the socio-cultural norms and then  prevailing industrial environment.. <br />
                    The decision of an  entrepreneur depends on a number of variable factors. Among the many, the  following factors are given weightage in making a choice of a suitable form of  organisation, which is most suited to one’s enterprise. The deciding core  factors are: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Type of business – service, trade, manufacturing. </li>
                    <li>Selection of industry and the area of operation. </li>
                    <li>Scope of operations, volume of business and the size of the  market, including its expected growth potential. </li>
                    <li>Amount of capital funds required – initial capital, working  capital. </li>
                    <li>Possibility of raising resources from the market –  institutions, subsidies and other incentives. </li>
                    <li>Costs and procedures and relative freedom from Government  regulations. </li>
                    <li>Comparative tax advantages, etc. </li>
                    <li>Size of the risk </li>
                    <li>Continuity of the enterprise. </li>
                    <li>Degree of direct control and adaptability of administration. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>By  and large, the final organizational choice is a compromise that is most  suitable to the entrepreneur’s needs. The above ten factors are the major  factors that will influence the choice of a proper form of an organisation,  which will withstand all the stresses and pressures and strive for its smooth  progress on an ongoing basis. <br />
                    The  aim of entrepreneurial development programmes in India should not be to treat  the small entrepreneurs as small, but to help the more promising and efficient  ones amongst them to grow big. This will mobilize the productive resources of  the country, contain the monopoly of a few large enterprises, and increase  income, profits and employment. The objective is to accelerate the process of  innovative entrepreneurial development in the country. Herein, choice of  organisation also depends on the entrepreneurial skills and vision. <br />
                    <strong>Ownership Organisation </strong> <br />
                    The  first and foremost question in organizing a small-scale industry is that of  ownership, represented by the right of an individual or a group of individuals  to acquire legal title to assets for the purpose of controlling an industrial  operation and enjoying the gains or profits flowing from such activities.<br />
                    Small  industrial units are, by and large, started by persons who value independence  and are desirous of obtaining the highest rewards for their initiative,  innovation, technical skills, business acumen and experience. As Nihal Singh  aptly observed that “The owner of a small industry values his undertaking for  the job it provides him as for any return it may make on his invested capital.  “The chief forms of an ownership organisation are: <br />
                    i.   Sole proprietorship <br />
                    ii.   Partnership; <br />
                    iii.  Co-operative society; and <br />
                    iv. Joint-stock company. <br />
                    Each entrepreneur has  to make policy decisions in all vital areas of business activities and organise  and manage his business affairs on scientific lines. He has to make a decision’  either as a manufacturer of some product or as the distributor of the products  made by others. Whatever activity he chooses, he will be confronted with  problems and his ultimate success will depend upon his entrepreneurial ability  to solve these problems. He will have to make a Policy decision about the size  of organisation. Should he start his enterprise as a’ sole proprietary concern,  partnership or any other form of organisation suited to the-needs of his,  business? Should it be a small-scale industry or a large-scale industry? He  should also decide whether to, register the SSIs with the appropriate  authorities or not. </p>
                </div>
                <br clear="all" />
                <div>
                  <p><strong>Ownership  Organisation Decision </strong> <br />
                    The entrepreneur’s  choice of the type of organisation will depend upon the nature of business,  scale of operation, capital requirements, ownership rights such as’ control and  decision-making opportunities and impact of taxation. He should understand the  impact of these factors on his business and decide whether to operate his  business as a one-man show or a joint venture company - In general, an  entrepreneur wishing to start an industry- on his own will prefer to organize  it on a small-scale unit if he has a limited capital and skill, and cater for  the local market. If he is unable to do so, he will call-for responses from  partners, join his in this business. In this way, new ability and more capital  will be brought into the businesses. Partnerships are common in commercial  businesses. <br />
                    Partnership is not a legal entity; the  partners are personally responsible for all the activities performed by them in  the name of the firm. The risks associated with the unlimited liability can be  avoided and large amount of capital can be brought by forming a limited  company. If the capital requirements are not very large, a private limited  company may be formed to meet the needs of a large  capital to run a large business, a public company will have  to be formed A survey of SSIs in Greater Bombay showed .the organisational  structure of small business units. The sole-proprietorship is the most popular  form of small business ownership. According to the survey, 78.5% of the total  units were of private proprietorship type, joint family and partnership  accounting together 20%, cooperative and private limited units accounting  together for about 1 % of the total. Even in the case of joint family and  partnership, many a times a single entrepreneur controls the enterprises. <br />
                    The type of organisation suited for these units depend upon  several factors such as the nature and type of industry, the extent of capital,  the nature of skill required, and the capacity to offer livelihood to the  participating factors. Sole proprietorship is, however, the dominant form in  these enterprises. </p>
                  <p><strong>State Policy </strong> <br />
                    It is the  policy of the Government, both at the Centre and in ­the States, to encourage  and promote cooperative enterprises of all types the Registrar- of cooperative  Societies in each State is concerning with the administration, supervision,  coordination and development of cooperative societies, -assisted by deputy  registrars, _assistant registrars and inspectors. The registrar offers  assistance and guidance in the formation of all types of cooperatives and keeps  a vigilant eye on their stability, administration, working, financial accounting,  etc. through instructions, regulations, inspections, audit and other checks.

                <p><strong>Sole Proprietorship</strong> </p>
                            
                <p>“Sole proprietorship is a form of  business organisation in which an individual invests his own capital, uses his  own skill and intelligence in the management of it’s- affairs and is solely  responsible for the results of its operation. The individual, with the  -assistance of other workers or by is own labour and capital; may nun the  industry. This form of organisation is also known” as individual  entrepreneurship - the oldest and the most sought after form of enterprise - in  the field of small-scale industry, and the easiest and simplest form of  entrepreneurship from the operational point of view. The individual  entrepreneur embarks upon some industrial activity with his own savings or with  funds borrowed from his friends or relatives.</p>
                <p><img width="559" height="372" src="lec17_clip_image002.jpg" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp; </p>
                <p> The industry may be started either in a  portion of the entrepreneur’s own house or in rented premises. There are no  legal formalities to be gone through except those required for a particular  type of industry. For example, if the entrepreneur decides to start a small  engraving industry, he has no legal’ formalities to comply with. He and’ his family  members may run the industry in their own residence.’ In this form of  ownership, the liability is unlimited. The small industrialist and the industry  are highly interrelated and integrated. If the industry prospers, the  entrepreneur is the sale beneficiary, and vice versa. Moreover, he enjoys full  c6htrolover the affairs of the industry and the sale authority to decide, plan  and control the operations of his business: In short, the entrepreneur is his  own master. The import features of a sole proprietorship’ are: </p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Merits </strong> <br />
The sole  proprietorship for of organization has the: following advantages: </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Easy  and simple formation: The greatest advantage of this form of organization are  necessary for its formation. One can open it easily and in a simple manner and  at the same time, one can close it down whenever he may choose to do so. There  are no legal formalities for expansion, contraction or dissolution of the  business. Thus, it is the most flexible type of business enterprise. </li>
                  <li>Smooth  management: Another merit of this form of organization is that the management  of the concern can be carried on smoothly. There is no one to oppose and hence  there is no room for any friction.</li>
                  <li>Promptness  in decision-making: The sole proprietor is free to conduct the affairs of his  business and he has to consult no one for it. For this reason, he is able to  make quick decisions without any delay and hesitation. Such promptness in  decision making is essential, in general, for the smooth conduct of business  operations. </li>
                  <li>Direct motivation and incentive to work: The sole”  proprietorship he to assume “all the risks and is entitled to receive all the  profits; therefore, he takes pains to work hard as there is direct relationship  between the efforts and the rewards. </li>
                  <li>Personal touch with customers: A sole trader is always able  to maintain close and personal touch with his customers with this, he is able  to the tastes and needs of the consumers. Such personal touch adds to the  success of the business. </li>
                  <li>Secrecy:  An individual entrepreneur’ is able to maintain complete secrecy about  important maters relating to his business and thus may be able to safeguard  business secrets from his competitors. </li>
                  <li>Social  advantages: This refers to the provision of employment opportunities to many by  ensuring diffusion of business ownership and thus concentration of wealth and  power in the hands of a few is avoided. Further, it helps in the development of  several essential qualities in entrepreneurs, such as the initiative, hard  work, responsibilities, taut “and. self-reliance etc. The single proprietorship  offers the best promise of securing motivation and “widespread ownership’ and  control of industry. </li>

                <div>
                  <p><strong>Limitations </strong> <br />
                    The sole  proprietorship .has several limitations which are as follows: <br />
                    i.   Limited financial resources: The greatest  limitation in this case is that the capital available for the business remains  very limited. An individual cannot possess enormous savings and he can borrow  only limited funds from his friends and relatives. He may not have enough  credit to borrow huge sums from the banks or financial institutions. This  limits the size as well as financial profits of the business. <br />
                    ii.  Limited managerial ability: An individual  cannot be expected to possess knowledge of every branch of management. Now,  when the management is highly specialized and business is becoming more and  more complex, nobody can claim to be an expert on all the subjects. An  individual may have limited knowledge and ability to take correct decisions. He  may take a wrong decision, which ultimately may prove to be drastic for the  business. Few persons are qualified by training or experience to handle alone  the varied problems of purchasing, merchandising, advertising, customer  relations and financing. <br />
                    iii.  Unlimited liability: Another great limitation is that the liability of the sole  trader is unlimited. It implies that there is always a risk that he may lose  the capital invested in his business as well as his personal property. In the  event of some disaster, his creditors can satisfy their claims out of his  personal property also. Thus, the entire risk has to be borne by one person  alone. But, in a way unlimited liability may be of help too. The sole trader  may get more credit from the creditors, as the limit of credit may extend to  the value of property owned by him, and it will not be limited to the extent of  capital invested by him in business only. <br />
                    iv. Lack of continuity: There is always lack of  continuity or stability, in such business. The mortality rate of such business  has also been high. If the owner all w ill or. he is away, the business stops.  In case of any mishap, the business may disappear completely or may have to be  rebuilt. <br />
                    In spite of the above  limitations, this form of business organisation occupies a prominent place in  the business world. In advanced countries and in developing economies like  India, it is playing an important role. This form is best for small ventures  and may be more than a match for larger enterprises’. It is more suitable for  concerns, where (i) capital required is small, {ii} risk involved is not heavy,  (iii) goods of artistic nature are to be produced, (iv) personal touch with  customers is necessary, (v) an. individual is able to control the affairs, (vi)  prompt decision is needed, (vii) scale of production is relatively small, and  (viii) operation is simple in character not needing highly skilled management. <br />
                    Nearly 61 % of the  SSIs are proprietary concerns. The most important factor in the formation of  proprietary concerns is non­interference, from others. Further, an entrepreneur  is not bound by law to publish annual accounts or to keep accounts except to  the extent it may be necessary to do so for income-tax and other related  purposes. He need not disclose any confidential informa­tion. Besides, this  form of organisation is simple, and no legal formalities are required for its  formation. </p>

                  </strong>
                    <p><strong>Partnership Organisation </strong> <br />
                      Partnership organisation grew and gained importance, as an  individual is not competent enough to possess enormous capital and knowledge or  competence to manage everything. With the expansion of business and enlargement  of the scale of its operations it became necessary for a group of persons to  join hands together and supply’ the necessary capital and skills. Often it is  found that a person may be having a huge capital but may not possess the  required skill. Individually, none of them can run a business  enterprise-single-handed but together they may be highly successful in its  operations. Thus, partner-ship organisation he been adopted to arrange’ more  capital, offer: better skill, control and management  to take advantage of high degree of specialization and division, of labour; and  to share the risks. In India, the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, governs such  organi­zations. Section 4 of this Act defines a partnership as “the relation  between persons who have agreed to share profits of a business carried on by  all or any of them acting for all.” Persons who enter into partnership are  collectively known as “firm” but individually known as Persons who enter ‘into  partnership are collectively known’ as “firm” but individually known as “partners.  “ <br />
                      If we  analyse this definition carefully, the following points emerge as the main  elements of “partnership” (i) Partnership is the relation between persons,  i.e., at least two persons, must be there to constitute a partnership. (ii)  There should he an agreement between them. This also means that persons .should  be- legally competent to enter into a contract (iii} They should carry on some  business. It implies that in agreement; to run a charitable institution will  not constitute a partnership. Business here necessarily implies a lawful  business. {iv} The business must be earned on by all or any of them acting for  all. Thus, one or some partners can represent the firm and bind it by his/their  actions in the course of business. </p>
                </div>
                <br clear="all" />
                <p><strong>Basic Features </strong> <br />
                  The  partnership organisation has some basic or fundamental features, which have  been discussed below, with special reference to the position -of partnership in  India. </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Number of persons: There should be at least two persons to  form a partnership organisation’. In India, there is no upper limit prescribed  under the Partnership Act, but a limit has been put under the Companies Act  indirectly. Under this Act, a partnership consisting of more than 20 Act  indirectly. Under this Act, a partnership consisting of more than 20 persons  for a general business and 10' persons for a banking business has been made,  illegal. Thus, the upper limit of the number of partners in a general business  is 20 and in the banking business it is 10. </li>
                  <li>Contractual relationship: Partnership is the result of  contractual relationship between two or more persons. There must be an  agreement between persons who wish to form a partnership. It is a fundamental  feature of the partnership organisation. For example, a manager of a firm may  get his remuneration which may be based on the profits of the firm, but on that  account he cannot be taken as a, partner as the element of agreement, is not  there. Similarly, two or more persons may be sharing the gains of a proper4ty  jointly held and on that account alone, there cannot be a partnership jointly  held between them. Further, as it is the result of a contract, the law does not  interfere with its formation or dissolution. On that very basis, no partners  agree for the same. Similarly, if a partner dies the firm gets dissolved, as  one of the contracting parties is dead. Thus, it has been rightly said that a  partnership arises from a contract and not from status. </li>
                  <li>No legal distinction: between firm and its  partners: It has been mentioned, earlier, that persons entering into a  partnership are individually known as partners and collectively as a firm.  Since a partnership is merely an association of persons, no separate legal  entity or factitious partners are created. This implies that the law does not  make any distinction between the firm and the partners who compose it. Any  partner can bind the firm with his decisions on behalf of the firm. But, at the  same time, a partner is free to undertake personal business or enter into  personal contracts. </li>
                  <li>Unlimited liability: Just like the sole  proprietorship, the liability of the owners of the firm is unlimited. But the  difference between the two is that in the case of the former, all risk is to be  shouldered by one person alone but in the case of a partnership, this is borne  by two or more persons. This means that a partner is not only liable to the  extent of capital he has invested in the firm but he may be called upon to meet  the liability out of his personal property also. If need be, the creditors of  the firm can claim debt but out of the personal property of the partners. In  such as eventuality, the partner loses the capital invested in the firm as well  as his personal property. </li>

                <p><strong>Advantages  of Partnership Organization </strong> <br />
                  A partnership  organisation has certain advantages as compared to the sole proprietorship or  joint – stock company organisation. We discuss below these advantages: </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Easy  formation: A partnership can be easily formed as no legal formalities are to be  observed to establish it. At the same time, unlike a company, not much of to be  observed to establish it. At the same time, unlike a company, not much of  expenses are incurred for its formation. </li>
                  <li>Flexibility:  A partnership organisation is highly flexible as well as mobile. Changes can be  introduced without’m\lct’1 difficulty. The necessary additional capital can be  raised, new partners be introduced including changes in the, place and object  of the firm. Business of the firm can’ also be expanded or contracted according  to the needs. </li>
                  <li>Pooling  of resources and skill. Unlike the sole proprietorship, under a partnership,  several persons pool their capital, resources, skill, expertise, experience and  services etc. Two or more persons are always better than one and bi that sense  partners strive to work with zeal for the better. It enables combination of  such individuals who may not be in a position to do anything alone. </li>
                  <li>Division of risks: Under a partnership, the risks of business  are divided among the partners and are not shouldered by one person alone.  Thus, it is more useful for business with ­large investments. </li>
                  <li>Strong credit position. Unlimited liability of the partners  enhances the creditworthiness of the firm. The credit can be extended to it to  the limit of the value of property owned by the partners, and not confined to  the extent of capital contributed by the, partners. Further, it restricts on  the speculative and reckless activities of the partner with, which they always  remain vigilant. </li>
                  <li>Less  incidence of tax. As compared to joint-stock company, the burden of taxes on a  form or its partners individually is lower.</li>
                  <li>Encouragement of mutual trust, personal  element in business: Partners act in cooperation and thus mutual faith, trust  and goodwill are maintained. They maintain personal relations with each other  and take personal care, to promote thee business of the firm. This personal  element in business that is not found in a company is highly useful. The  existence of partnerships rests on mutual faith and goodwill and that way it  encourages the spirit of helpfulness and instills the qualities of honesty,  sincerity, responsibility, initiative and self-reliance. </li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Disadvantages </strong> <br />
                  While-the  partnership organisation has the above advantages; it has the following serious  limitations which cannot be ignored: <br />
                  i.   Limited resources. In spite of pooling its of  resources by in partners, it is not possible to raise-huge amount of capital  and engage specialists required for modern business or Industrial units.  Partners may be rich but their capacity to contribute capital is limited as  compared to the needs of modem industrial complexes. <br />
                  ii.  Unlimited liability: One of the serious  limitations of a partnership organisation is that the liability of partners is  not limited. The partners like the sole trader unlike the shareholders of a  company, may be personally held liable for the debts incurred by the firm.  Their private property also remains at stake. Moreover, liability is  cumulative. Further, a partner may also be called upon to compensate for the  misdeeds and dishonesty of his fellow partners along with his own acts. <br />
                  iii.  Instability: Theoretically, it may appear that the partnership organisation is  more stable than the sole proprietorship but in practice it is not so. It is  often found that a firm’s business comes to an end on account of petty quarrels  among the partners. <br />
                  If a partner is dishonest and  short-tempered, it may become difficult for other partners to carry on business  with him.’ Any misunderstanding may prove ruinous- for it. It is also unstable  because death, retirement, and insolvency of a partner may dissolve the  partnership. It is quite true that the partnership provides better means to  perpetuate itself “but existence of that ‘self’ at any given time is, more  precious.” <br />
                  iv. Lack of harmony of interest. Unlike a sole  proprietorship, it is not possible to maintain harmony of interests among the  partners. There is always the possibility of friction. The partners may follow  a conservative policy to avoid risk of their private property. Their combined  judgement often may not prove useful. If mutual cooperation is lacking, prompt  decisions may also not be possible. There is the possibility of leakage of  business secrets and matters which may’ affect the business adversely. <br />
                  About 35% of the SSIs in India existed as partnership concerns  6f which;. 21% are joint-family partnerships and 14% partnership concerns. Very  often, small entrepreneurs with business acumen and training are handicapped by  lack of capital; or there may be need of a wealthy man with managerial capacity.  Partnership organisations grew essentially out of the failures and limitations  of the sole proprietorship form of organisation. The formation and management  of a partnership organisation is governed by the provisions of the Indian  Partnership Act of 1932. According to it, a “ partnership is the relation  between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on  by all or by anyone of them acting for all.” A partnership deed is essential  for this type of organisation. The Partnership Act, 1932 outlines the rights  and duties of a partner. The liability of a partnership is unlimited. <br />
                  The  ownership pattern of small units is given in the above table. As indicated in  the table, 61% of the units are single proprietary small – scale industrial  units, followed by family partnerships, i.e., businesses owned by two or more  members of the family. Only 14% of these units are non – family partnerships,  where the ownership is held by a small group which does not constitute a  family. Among the small – scale industrialists, there is a strong tendency to  keep the business within the family. As a general rule, a non-family  partnership is restricted to craftsmen pooling their resources; alternatively,  it may be a venture of a group of merchants. An industry – wise analysis shows  that in the printing presses, general engineering and soap industries, 20% of  the units fall in the category of non – family partnerships. In these cases, a  large amount of capital investment is necessary, and the family resources are  generally too meager for such a venture. The capital resources are increased by  converting the industrial unit into a non – family partnership. </p>

The  growth of joint-stock companies constitutes an important step in the historical  evolution of forms of ownership of business enterprises. With the enlargement  of the scale of business operations, it became difficult for a sole trader or  partnership firm to cope with the problems of finding more resources and  managing for more specialised management. <br />
The development of  these companies has taken place almost in all the countries of the world but  the nomenclature differs. There may be technical points of difference but the  basic characteristics are almost the same everywhere. We call it joint-stock  company in England and in India. In the U.S.A., it is known as a “corporation. <br />
<strong>Definition:</strong> A company is a  voluntary association of persons who contribute to its capital but their  liability remains limited. It carries on business for profit as a legal entity.  It can sue and be sued in its own name. Thus, a corporation is an artificial  being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in the contemplation of law. <br />
Being  a more creation of law, it possesses only those properties which the charter of  its creation confers upon it, either expressly or as incidental to its very  existence. </p>
                <p><strong>Salient Features </strong> <br />
                  A  joint-stock company exists as a separate legal entity quite apart from that of  the members comprising the organisation unlike a partnership. In other words,  this company is considered to be a “person”’ in the eyes of law. Also this  company possesses the right to own and transfer any property. <br />
                  In India, only 3% of  the units exist as joint-stock companies. In a sense, it is an extension of the  partnership form; it is an associa­tion of a number of members which has a  legal sanction behind it. Because of the complicated and cumbersome legal  procedures, heavy taxation and the possibility of’ unscrupulous promote.  Securing capital for an undesirable concern this system has not made any headway  in the-small scale industries sector. </p>
                <p><strong>The Co-operatives ­</strong> <br />
                  A cooperative society  is essentially an association of persons who join together or a voluntary basis  for the furtherance of - their common economic interests. The International  Labour Organisation - (ILO) defines a cooperative as “an association of  persons, usually of limited means, who voluntarily join together to achieve a  common economic end through - the formation of ­a, idiomatically ‘controlled  business organisation, making an equitable contribution to the capital required  and accepting fair share of the risks and benefits of the-undertaking. “This  type of organisation has not made any appreciable impact on the small-scale  industrial sector Of the total small scale units, only 0.7% are organised as  cooperative societies. These are mainly in which industries as, wooden  furniture, and fixtures utensils, agricultural hand tools and implements,  printing, and washing soaps. <br />
  <strong>Forms of Organisation </strong> <br />
                  The selection or the  form of organisation depends basically on the nature of industrial activity  proposed to be undertaken, the scale of operations in terms of the volume of  business proposed to be handled, the scope of the market to be covered, the  sharing of risks and tax advantages. Three salient features of all forms of  organisation are: </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Relationship  – Line, Functional, Staff. </li>
                  <li>Authority  – Direct, Indirect, Representative. </li>
                  <li>Responsibility – General, Specialized, Advisory. In other  words, the organisational structure is based on: </li>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Division of labour; </li>
                    <li>Co-ordination; </li>
                    <li>Accomplishment  of goals and objectives; and </li>
                    <li>Authority – responsibility. </li>
                  </ol>
                </ol>
                <p>Comparative  Evaluation of Different Forms of Business Ownership (See Table Below)<br />
                  The process of organisation consists in making a rational  division of work into groups of activities for the accomplishment of a task.  The various stages of this process are: </p>
                
                <ul>
                  <li>Determination of objectives; </li>
                  <li>Enumeration of activities; </li>
                  <li>Classification </li>
                  <li>Fitting individuals {workers} into functional, activities;  and </li>
                  <li>Assignment of authority for action. </li>

                  <p><strong>Line Organisation </strong><br />
                    A line organisation is  the basic framework of an organisation. It is the backbone of the  organisational hierarchy. Mr. Lundy has observed that “line organisation is  characterised by direct lines of authority flowing -from, the top to the bottom  of the organisational hierarchy and lines of responsibility flowing in an  opposite but equally direct manner.” Under this type, various activities are  organised in groups and controlled by a manager, who is responsible to the top  man. In this type of organisation, authority flows from the top to the bottom  while responsibility flows from the bottom to the top. <br />
                    <strong>Advantages </strong> </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>It  is simple to form and easy to operate. </li>
                    <li>In  it, line executives enjoy decision-making powers. </li>
                    <li>It  has a systematic organisational structure. </li>
                    <li>It maintains a balance between authority, responsibility and  accountability. </li>
                    <li>Discipline can be maintained easily. </li>
                    <li>Communication  is easy and quick. </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p><strong>Disadvantages </strong> </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>It  becomes autocratic or dictatorial. </li>
                    <li>It  suffers from lack of specialization. </li>
                    <li>There  is an overload of responsibility. </li>
                    <li>It hampers initiative. </li>
                    <li>There is absence of co-ordination, among the different  departments. </li>
                    <li>It  is unstable. </li>

                  <p><strong>Functional Organisation </strong> <br />
                    The simplest type of  departmentation is the functional type of structure, which consists of grouping  of all similar activities into major departments. It was organised by F. W.  Taylor with -a -view to bringing about the specialization of management  activities. Under functional foremanship, office work is separated from shop or  plant work. </p>
                  <p><strong>Functional Structure</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Note.</strong> In a pure functional  organistion, we have multiple and divided responsibility. Although there is a  need for functionalisation, it is probably never used in its pure form. A  practical approach to functionalisation is reflected in the line – and – staff  organisation, which is necessary for a large enterprise. <br />
                      <strong>Advantages </strong> </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>It  promotes a better division of labour. </li>
                    <li>It  ensures proper communication. </li>
                    <li>It  offers a good scope for specialization. </li>
                    <li>It promotes coordinated work. </li>
                    <li>It ensures systematic organisation. </li>

                    <li>There  is a tendency towards over – specialization. </li>
                    <li>In  this type of organisation, it is difficult to pinpoint responsibility. </li>
                    <li>It is costly. </li>
                    <li>There is no continuity of authority. </li>
                    <li>Lower  potency for developing managers for promotion. </li>

                <p><strong>Selecting  a viable Structure </strong> <br />
                  Industrial activity  has been diversified in which routine functions -are entrusted to the  secretary, accountant, sales director. The industrialist ‘has opened-a new  branch for export and importance has also sought the services of a legal  adviser in all legal matters connected with the operation of his industry. <br />
                  Apparently, the  functioning of a small-scale Indus by is organised on the basis of their  functional activities. The owner-industrialist still provides the necessary  leadership and initiative. The overall control remains in his hands. In many  cases, key positions like those of the works, manager, the sales director and  the accoun­tant; are held by his close relatives (brother or sons), while other  routine ‘matters’ are looked after by employees whose services are hired. <br />
                  The small-scale industrialist also appoints young and well  qualified to attend to the Personnel problems of his industry. To make the  delegation of authority really effective, he should not only, pay due attention  to the principles of delegation, but also recognize the obstacles that stand in  the way of a true delegation of authority. He should create an atmosphere in  which the line staff is prepared to give and accept authority and  responsibility enthusiastically. This is the beginning of delegation and an  appreciation of modem management methods with a view to maximising profits. <br />
                  Finally,  he has to select a viable structure most suited to achieve his objective or  goals. In the words of Peter Drucker; “Organisation is not an ‘end in itself,  but a means to an end of business performance and business results.  Organisation Structure is an indispensable means; and the wrong structure will  seriously impair business performance and may even destroy it... Organisation,  structure must’ be, designed so as to make possible the attainment of the  objectives of the business for five ten fifteen years hence.” This may be  achieved by analysis of activities, decision analysis and relations analysis -  all on a continuing basis. All in all, the organisation structure must contain  the least possible number of management levels, and forge the shortest possible  chain of command. It must also make possible the training and testing of  tomorrow’s top entrepreneurs. <br />
  <strong>Deciding Factors on Organisation while Starting a Business </strong> <br />
                  It is worthwhile for  the entrepreneur of a new or proposed business to be familiar with the  following factors in making a choice, for a suitable form of ownership: </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Type of business - service, trade, manufacturing </li>
                  <li>Scope of operations - volume of business and the size of the  market area served. </li>
                  <li>Degree of direct control and management desired by the  owners. </li>
                  <li>Amount of capital funds required. </li>
                  <li>Size of the risk. </li>
                  <li>Continuity of the concern. , </li>
                  <li>Costs and procedures and relative freedom from government  regulation. </li>
                  <li>Adaptability of administration. </li>
                  <li>Comparative tax advantage, etc. An  entrepreneur has to weigh these major factors, as well as others in deciding  the form of organisation while starting a business. Many a times, an  enterprise, like a rivet, may be started as a proprietary concern, converted  into a partnership when like-minded people come together, promoted into a  joint-stock company when it grows substantially big. This organizational  evolution is an ongoing process through interaction with the social, political  and economic environment. The best and the bright always stand out as the most  outstanding.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The best invariably prosper. Prosperity leads .to growth. And  growth ultimately shows up in increased size. So in a free market economy, the  size of the business (enterprise) is a. fair indicator of excellence. Managing  a larger enterprise is without doubt more difficult that running a small one.  And so it is likely that many small enterprises are more profitable than their  larger counter­parts. But this in no way detracts from the achievements of the  latter. Big is always better, by way of its inherent strength, the capacity to  bear opted shocks and stresses and simply by the fact that it has grown so big  in a world where roughly everyone has had the same opportunities.<br />
