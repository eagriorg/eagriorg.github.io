				<p>Green Revolution  initiatives have to achieve self sufficiency by increasing food grains  production. Simultaneously, several initiatives have been taken to promote  agricultural marketing in the state. Marketing infrastructure plays a pivotal  role in fostering and sustaining the tempo of rural economic development.  Marketing is as critical to better performance in agriculture as farming  itself. According to the National Commission on Agriculture (XII report),  Agricultural Marketing is a process, which starts with a decision to produce a  saleable farm commodity and it involves all the aspects relating to pre and  post-harvest operations including assembling, grading, storage, transportation  and distribution. These operations add value to farm produce. <br />
In order to create the  needed infrastructure, promote institutions and also to regulate the marketing  practices, Government of Tamil Nadu enacted the ' Tamil Nadu Agricultural  Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act 1987 and Rules 1991 ' replacing the earlier  Act 1959. <br />
The Department of  Agricultural Marketing, which is functioning since 1977, with the main  objective of Regulation of Agricultural Marketing, was renamed in the year 2001  as Department of Agricultural Marketing and Agri. Business in order to focus on  other activities like Agri Export, Post Harvest Management, Food Processing,  etc.<br />
The main activities of the  Department of Agricultural Marketing and Agri. Business are as follows:<br />
1. Establishment and  maintenance of regulated markets in order to facilitate buying and selling of  agricultural produce for the benefit of the farming community.<br />
2. To create awareness  among the farmers about the benefits of marketing their produce through  regulated markets by taking up publicity and propaganda.<br />
3. Commercial grading of  agricultural produce in the regulated markets and at farm holdings to help the  producers to get remunerative price for their produce.<br />
4. To take up Agmark  grading of agricultural, animal husbandry and forestry products for the benefit  of the consumers.<br />
5. To set up Agriculture  Export Zones for promoting export of agricultural produce by increasing the  area under exportable crops, providing necessary post harvest management and  other infrastructure required and information on prices prevailing at  international markets as an integrated approach.<br />
6. To set up modern cold  storage facilities to enable the farmers to store and sell their produce at  favourable price level (Cold chain from farm to market).<br />
7. To promote Food  Processing Industries.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Market Committees</strong> <br />
				  At present 20 Market  committees are functioning in Tamil Nadu covering various districts except  Chennai and the Nilgiris. Now, these Market Committees are functioning with  nominated Members and Chairperson elected by the members from January 2003. </p>
				<p><strong>Regulated Markets</strong> <br />
				  There are 273 Regulated  Markets, 15 Sub Markets, 15 Check Posts, 108 Rural Godowns and 108 Grading  Centres functioning under the 20 Market Committees. A new Regulated Market was  opened on 30.08.2003 at Sathankulam in Thoothukudi District based on the  announcement made by the Hon'ble Chief Minister at Sathankulam. <br />
				  Competitive and  remunerative prices are ensured for the produce sold by the farmers through  closed tender system in the Regulated Markets. Free Grading facilities for  agricultural commodities are also made available in the Regulated Markets.<br />
				  The Market Committees are  collecting 1% of the value of the produce transacted as market fee from the  traders. Licence fee is also collected from the traders and weighment. No fee  is collected from producers / sellers for any service rendered in the Regulated  Markets. </p>
				<p><strong>Services Rendered in the  Regulated Markets</strong> <br />
				  These include correct  weighment, godown facilities, banking facilities, immediate payment, price  information, rest sheds, drinking water facility, cattle sheds, free medical  aid to farmers, input shops, payment counter for easy disbursement, phone and  fax facilities, etc.</p>
				<p><strong>Notification of produce</strong> <br />
				  So far, 40 agricultural  commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, cotton, turmeric, etc. have been  notified.</p>
				<p><strong>Commercial Grading</strong> <br />
				  To help the producers to  get better prices for their produce according to their grades, 96 Commercial  Grading Centres, 11 Kapas Grading Centers and one Tobacco Grading Centre are  functioning in the Regulated Markets. Commercial grading of agricultural  produce is done in the villages also. These centers are now renamed as  &quot;Post Harvest Technology Information Centers&quot;. The farmers are  educated in adopting post harvest technologies on agricultural commodities by  the technically qualified staff working in the above centers.</p>
				<p><strong>Pledge Loan Facilities to  Farmers</strong> <br />
				  In order to avoid distress  sales by the small and marginal farmers in the peak season, Regulated Markets  are issuing pledge loan to farmers. Under this scheme, the farmers can store  their agricultural produce in the godowns of Regulated Markets for a maximum  period of 6 months and take pledge loan of 75% of the total value of the  produce upto a maximum of Rs.50, 000.</p>
				<p><strong>Pledge Loan Facilities to  Traders</strong> <br />
				  As an incentive to the  traders and to help them to make immediate payment to the farmers, pledge loan  is given to the licensed traders in the Regulated Markets. Pledge loan of 50%  of the total value of the purchased produce or Rs. 1.00 lakh, which ever is  less, is made available to the traders. The maximum stocking period is 3 months  for the traders.</p>
				<p><strong>Tamil Nadu Farmers  Development and Welfare Scheme</strong> <br />
				  Under this scheme, the  farmers / tenants who sell their agricultural produce of one metric tonne or  more through Regulated Markets every year are eligible for a grant of a lumpsum  amount upto Rs.75, 000, in case of death/ permanent disability occurring due to  accident. In the event of death/ disability the nominee of the farmer / tenant  and in the absence of nominee, the legal heir of the family will be eligible  for the lumpsum grant. The farmers need not pay any premium for this fund. The  Market Committee concerned and the Tamil Nadu State Agricultural Marketing Board  will bear the premium amount of Rs.10 per individual per year equally.</p>
				<p><strong>Agmark Grading</strong> <br />
				  Grading under AGMARK has  already become a symbol of quality. In order to help the consumer to get  quality food products, 30 State Agmark Grading Laboratories, 15 Agricultural  Officer (Marketing) Centers and one Principal Laboratory are functioning in the  State. Agmark grading is done for centralised and de-centralised commodities by  the technically qualified staff. Agmark labels are issued to the authorised  packers under the direct supervision of the staff for certifying the quality  and purity of the food products.</p>
				<p><strong>Construction of Drying  Yards in the Villages</strong> <br />
				  In order to minimise the  post harvest losses in grains, the department has taken up construction of  drying yards at village level. Under this scheme, so far 580 drying yards have  been constructed at a total cost of Rs.10.24 crores. Construction of 150 drying  yards at a total cost of Rs.3.00 crores for the year 2003-2004 is in progress  due to spill over work.</p>
				<p><strong>Construction Of Market  Complex</strong> <br />
                    <strong>Paddy Market Complex</strong> <br />
				  At Madurai, a market  complex is being established exclusively for paddy at a total cost of Rs.12.60  crores. This market complex will cater to the marketing needs of paddy growing  farmers and traders.<br />
  <strong>Agricultural Production  And Marketing Information Centre</strong> <br />
				  Market intelligence plays  a vital role in marketing of agricultural produce. If information on commodity  prices in various markets is made available, the farmers would get better price  for their produce. Taking this objective into consideration, establishment of  Agricultural Production and Marketing Information Centre is in progress in  fourteen Regulated Markets at a cost of Rs.45.00 lakhs and another five  Regulated Markets would also get this facility at a cost of Rs.20.00 lakhs  during 2004-05 based on order issued in 2003-04. Based on the success and  usefulness of the facility to the farmers, this scheme will be further  expanded.</p>
				<p><strong>Agri  Export Zones</strong> <br />
                    <strong>Agri  Export Zones Established</strong> <br />
				  To promote Agricultural  Exports from Tamil Nadu, three Agri Export Zones for specific commodities have  been established as detailed below.<br />

				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Establishment of Cold  Chain Units</strong> <br />
				  To minimise post harvest  losses of agricultural produces, especially fruits and vegetables, it is  proposed to set up Cold Storage Units through private sector in the following  places: -</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Oddanchatram of Dindigul district.</li>
				  <li>Tiruchirappalli.</li>
				  <li>Vellore.</li>
				  <li>Thalaivasal of Salem district.</li>
				  <li>Udumalpet of Coimbatore district.</li>
				  <li>Batlagundu of Dindigul district.</li>
				  <li>Virudhunagar.</li>
				  <li>Vilathikulam of Thoothukudi district.</li>
				  <li>Chinnamanur of Theni district.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>Of these 9 places, this  department has already selected private entrepreneurs for setting. </p>
				<p>The details on prices of  major commodities at international markets of the past and present will be  collected and analysed and future export prices will be forecast based on the  analysis. The possible countries to which exports can be made would also be  forecast by the cell. Visit to select markets at national and international  level will be undertaken whenever needed. The information generated by the  Domestic and Export Market Intelligence Cell will help to forecast the prices  of the commodities in the forthcoming months and the same will be transmitted  to the regulated markets and the farmers. Apart from this, the prices  prevailing in nearby states will also be announced to the farmers so that they  will be able to get better prices for their crops which will help them in  planning crop pattern and the right time of sale of their crop output. <br />
				  The cell will also guide  prospective exporters on whom to approach, where to approach etc i.e. the agencies  dealing with the export item so that their problems are sorted out. This is  proposed to be set up at a cost of Rs. 20.00 lakhs in the first year, Rs.12.00  lakhs in the 2nd and 3rd years respectively. After that it is expected that the  cell would be able to attract alternative funding/ payment for its services to  ensure its continued survival and growth. </p>
				<p><strong>Turmeric Market Complex</strong> <br />
				  A new Turmeric Market  Complex will be established at Nasianur and Villarasampatti Village near Erode  at a cost of Rs. 36.32 Crores. In this complex, infrastructure facilities will  be provided viz., Information Centre, Conference Hall, Bank, Agmark Lab,  Farmers Retiring Room etc. The State Agricultural Marketing Board and Erode  Market Committee will invest a sum of Rs. 11.32 crores.</p>
