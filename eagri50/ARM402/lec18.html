				<p>Finance is needed throughout a company’s life. The type and  amount of finance required for a business depends on many factors: type of  business, success of firm and state of the economy. There are two main types of  money that a company needs. <br />
                    <strong>Capital expenditure:</strong> Used for buying fixed assets where large sums of money are involved but they  are not purchased often e.g. new premises. <br />
                    <strong>Working capital:</strong> Day to day money  required for running the business. There are two main sources of finance, these  are internal sources and external sources. <br />
                    <strong>Internal sources include: </strong> <br />
				  Retained profit - profit made is reinvested into the business.  Controlling working capital - reducing costs, delaying outflows and speeding up  inflows. Sale of assets - Assets the company owns can be sold and then leased  back, which frees up a large amount of capital in the short term. </p>
				<br clear="all" />
                <div>
                  <p><strong>External  sources of finance: </strong> <br />
                    Increasing trade  credit - delaying payments on purchases for as<br />
                    long as possible.<br />
                    Factoring - use  a company to collect all debts.<br />
                    Overdraft - an  agreement with a bank to be allowed to overdraw a certain amount.<br />
                    Grants - an agreed amount of money given for a special reasonby government or other organisation.<br />
                    Venture capital - people invest in the company when it is unable to float on  the stock market.<br />
                    Debentures  - business equivalent of a mortgage. Loan for a set length of time at a set  interest rate.<br />
                    Share issues - selling of new  shares to raise capital.<br />
                    Owners savings - the owners  investing money into the business.<br />
                    Bank loans - medium or long term  loans but interest is charged.<br />

                    Sources of finance for small and  growing businesses<br />
                    <strong>Introduction </strong> <br />
                    In  this revision note, we concentrate on how small and medium- sized businesses  (“SME’s”) obtain finance.<br />
                    SME’s can be defined  as having three main characteristics:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Companies  are not quoted on a stock exchange – they are “unquoted” </li>
                    <li>Ownership of the business is typically restricted to a few  individuals. Often this is a family connection between the shareholders </li>
                    <li>Many SME’s are the means  by which individuals (or small groups) effectively achieve self-employment </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The SME sector is a vital one in the UK economy. In 1999, the  Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) estimated that there are 3.7 SME  businesses in the UK. Sole traders account for the majority of the businesses  in the UK (63 per cent) but a smaller proportion of the number of employees (23  per cent) and an even smaller proportion of turnover (9 per cent). As a  proportion of all businesses in the UK, SME’s account for some 55 per cent of  employment and 45 per cent of turnover. </p>
                  <p><strong>Why do SME’s find financing a  problem? </strong> <br />
                    The  main problem faced by SME’s when trying to obtain funding is that of  uncertainty: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>SME’s rarely have a long history or successful track record  that potential investors can rely on in making an investment; </li>
                    <li>Larger companies (particularly those quoted on a stock  exchange) are required to prepare and publish much more detailed financial  information – which can actually assist the finance-raising process; </li>
                    <li>Banks are particularly  nervous of smaller businesses due to a perception  that they represent a greater credit risk. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Because the information is not available in other ways, SME’s  will have to provide it when they seek finance. They will need to give a  business plan, list of the company assets, details of the experience of  directors and managers and demonstrate how they can give providers of finance  some security for amounts pro­vided. <br />
                    Prospective  lenders – usually banks – will then make a decision based on the information  provided. The terms of the loan (interest rate, term, security, repayment  details) will depend on the risk involved and the lender will also want to  monitor their investment. <br />
                    A  common problem is often that the banks will be unwilling to increase loan  funding without an increase in the security given (which the SME owners may be  unable or unwilling to provide). <br />
                    A  particular problem of uncertainty relates to businesses with a low asset base.  These are companies without substantial tangible assets, which can be, use to  provide security for lenders. <br />
                    When  an SME is not growing significantly, financing may not be a major problem.  However, the financing problem becomes very important when a company is growing  rapidly, for example when contemplating investment in capital equipment or an  acquisition. <br />
                    Few growing companies are able to finance their expansion plans  from cash flow alone. They will therefore need to consider raising finance from  other external sources. In addition, managers who are looking to buy-in to a  business (“management buy-in” or  “MBI”)  or buy-out (management buy-out” or “MBO”) a business from its owners, may not  have the resources to acquire the company. They will need to raise finance to  achieve their objectives. </p>

                <div>
                  <p><strong>Sources  of finance for SME’s </strong> <br />
                    There  are a number of potential sources of finance to meet the needs of small and  growing businesses: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Existing shareholders and directors funds (“owner financing”) </li>
                    <li>Overdraft financing </li>
                    <li>Trade credit </li>
                    <li>Equity finance </li>
                    <li>Business angel financing </li>
                    <li>Venture capital </li>
                    <li>Factoring and invoice discounting </li>
                    <li>Hire purchase and leasing </li>
                    <li>Merchant banks (medium to longer term loans </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>A  key consideration in choosing the source of new business finance is to strike a  balance between equity and debt to ensure the funding structure suits the  business. <br />
                    The  main differences between borrowed money (debt) and equity are that bankers  request interest payments and capital repayments, and the borrowed money is  usually secured on business assets or the personal assets of shareholders  and/or directors. A bank also has the power to place a business into  administration or bank­ruptcy if it defaults on debt interest or repayments or  its prospects decline. <br />
                    In  contrast, equity investors take the risk of failure like other shareholders,  whilst they will benefit through participation in increasing levels of profits  and on the eventual sale of their stake. However, in most circumstances venture  capitalists will also require more complex investments (such as preference  shares or loan stock) in additional to their equity stake. <br />
                    The  overall objective in raising finance for a company is to avoid exposing the  business to excessive high borrowings, but without unnecessarily diluting the  share capital. This will ensure that the financial risk of the company is kept  at an optimal level. </p>

                <div>
                  <p><strong>Types  of Financial Assistance </strong> <br />
                    The  financing tools available to manufacturers take many forms, but four types  predominate: debt, equity, tax incentives, and grants. Different tools are best  suited to different needs, and manufacturers need to understand these  variations in order to come up with the best fit with their financing needs. <br />
                    <strong>Debt–Loans, Loan Guarantees, and  Other Tools </strong> <br />
                    Most  public assistance to manufacturers seeks to make financial resources more  available to businesses through loans, loan guarantees, and various types of  interest subsidies. Manufacturers should recognize that the general goal of all  these programs is this: to make loan capital more available at the best rates  and terms possible. <br />
                    At the same time, manufacturers need to understand the context  in which all these programs operate, namely, that they are usually available to  all qualifying businesses, no matter what sector of the economy. Most programs  only limit company participation on the basis of size (usually, number of  employees or annual sales). The Small Business Administration (SBA) is the  leading Federal agency in this arena; many States have similar programs in  place as well. These programs either subsidize the cost of capital or help  ensure its availability. Typically, rates of interest are at or below  prevailing market rates, depending on the program’s objectives and  constituency. These debt programs often are used to help attract capital for  expansion projects or general business operation. They also seek to support  promising firms that private lenders view as high risk, as well as otherwise  solid companies unable to meet standard commercial lending terms. <br />
                    Depending  on the specifics of any given program (i.e., what’s eligible for assistance,  private match required, etc.) manufacturers can use them for a variety of  business capital needs—financing building construction, acquiring equipment and  machinery, funding plant expansions, or supporting export activity. Some  programs meet a company’s need for working capital, chronically in short supply  for smaller manufacturers. In recent years, SBA loan guarantees have helped a  number of manufacturers who needed capital to incorporate new technologies or  make impor­tant efficiency improvements. <br />
                    Debt  programs are designed to improve the availability and affordability of capital.  Manufacturers need to realize, though, that most public program officials  follow their own guidelines to minimize risk, and these may be rigid as well.  They are account­able to State or Federal agency oversight, and are just as  concerned about business failure as their private-sector counter­parts.  Therefore, to the extent, they can, manufacturers need to shape their requests  for financial assistance to meet the require­ments of the program being  considered. As a result, capital access remains a problem for many new or small  operations, despite considerable State and Federal attempts to improve it. <br />
                    Although debt  financing is the primary Federal financing approach, and well suited to many  situations, manufacturers need to realize that debt programs will not work in  every case. Loans and loan guarantees may not fit with the financial needs of  various new or expanding business situations, modernization or efficiency  improvements, or of manufacturers engaged in technology-related projects. Many  such firms, while economically sound overall, have initial cash-flow  difficulties, and debt programs require a constant stream of repayments  beginning almost immediately. Manufacturers trying to modernize or diversify  often must borrow considerable sums to invest in production facilities and  equipment. As small manufacturers are only too well aware, many small firms  fail—not from lack of demand for their products or services—but because they  cannot meet debt installments. The time lag on accounts receivable, for  instance, can cause an insurmountable cash-flow barrier for small businesses.<br />
                    <strong>Equity </strong> <br />
                    Equity-finance programs can address  concerns over cash flow, because they do not feature a strict repayment  schedule. Equity programs make capital more available through direct investment  (and a potential return based on the success of the company), rather than by  lump-sum loan proceeds (which must be repaid in installments). They promote  development by investing funds in capital-poor but  otherwise competitive enterprises, many of which are technologically  innovative. Equity programs on a significant scale are a relatively new  public-sector financial assistance phenomenon. A few States have explored  venture capital-style assistance programs. At the Federal level, only SBA’s  Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) operates as an equity assistance  program. <br />
                    In terms of equity programs, manufacturers need to realize that,  in practice, SBA and similar State programs makes equity investments much like  a private equity investor or venture capitalist. SBA and its program  partners—licensed Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs) are looking for  deals that work. Investors, (in the case of SBA programs, through the SBICs),  take an ownership interest in a company in exchange for funds. Equity is a  riskier channel of investment than debt. If there are no profits or the  business folds, the investor makes nothing or even loses its money. On the  other hand, if the company does well, the investor (private, State or SBIC) can  reap a substantial return. <br />
                    Equity  programs operate more like a stock purchase than a debt investment, structured  to give a company relief from redeeming its obligation until a certain level of  return is reached. In contrast to debt financing, equity usually is more  “patient” money. Because returns are a function of profit, and profit is linked  to the company’s success, they are not expected immediately. The timing and  size of payments are geared to the company’s financial condition, thus removing  early cash-flow pressures and giving the firm time to use its cash to advance  restructuring or moderniza­tion efforts. At the same time, though, investors  usually expect a greater return on an equity investment than traditional  lenders do from loans.<br />
                    <strong>Tax Incentives </strong> <br />
                    The  only significant Federal tax incentives specifically targeted to manufacturers  are industrial development bonds (IDBs) which can be used for a variety of  financial needs including site preparation and equipment acquisition. IDBs are  available in every State, and each State sets its own eligibility conditions  and authorizes its own set of issuing entities; typically, they include State  agencies, local governments, development authorities, and similar  organizations. <br />
                    State  and local governments offer most of the tax incentives to promote manufacturing  including abatements, investment incentives, exemptions or moratoriums for  capital improvements, and incentives for job creation. State and local tax  incentives often are linked to or packaged with Federal financing assistance.  They are offered on the premise that reducing taxes lowers the cost of doing  business in an area, making it more attractive for companies to locate there or  to maintain or expand existing operations. The latter rationale often is cited  when long-time manufacturing companies seek help to retool. Thus, manufactur­ers  can make a stronger case for State and local tax relief or tax-code linked  assistance by showing the community impact and local benefits of their proposed  project. </p>
                </div>
                <br clear="all" />
                <div>
                  <p><strong>Grants </strong> <br />
                    Many  manufacturers, when they decide to seek public financing assistance, think of  grants. Grants are direct transfers of money to the recipient, usually with no  payback obligation. Manufacturers need to know that little direct grant  assistance is available, and the competition for it is fierce—and not just from  other companies, but also from healthcare facilities and social service  organizations. The average grant dollar amounts for each project are kept as  low as possible because grants are designed to help leverage other sources of  financing. Many grants are cost-shared—requiring financial commitments from  grant recipients. Most grants are done as “pass throughs”—funds are provided to  an intermediary, such as a city or development organization, which, in turn,  provides funds to the private company. Virtually all Federal grant assistance  is delivered this way. In short, manufacturers can tap several types of public  resources, and use them in a variety of ways to help finance manufacturing  efficiency and modernization projects, develop new technologies and products,  and help attract private investment. The most suitable approach depends on the  specifics of any given program, the current development climate in a given  area, and the financial requirements of the companies wanting to carry out  improvements. It is limited only by the creativity of the participants. </p>

                  <p><strong>Short  Term Financing </strong> <br />
                    Provides  information about short term financing for businesses, it also provides some  examples of sources of short term financing. <br />
                    <strong>What is Short Term Financing? </strong> <br />
                    Short  term financing is essentially to provide capital deficit businesses funds for a  short term period of a year or less. <br />
                    <strong>What is short term financing for? </strong> <br />
                    These  funds are usually for businesses to run their day-to-day operations including  payment of wages to employees, inventory ordering and supplies.<br />
                    An example of short  tern financing could be when a firm places an order for raw materials, it pays  with finance and anticipates to recoup this finance by selling these goods over  the period of a year. <br />
                    <strong>Difference Between  Short Term and Long Term Financing </strong> <br />
                    In contrast long-term  financing decisions are involved when a firm purchases a special machine that  will reduce operating costs over, say, the next five years. <br />
                    Following from the  earlier explanation that short term borrowing should be used for working  capital requirements for day to day operations of a business. Industries with  seasonal peaks and troughs and those engaged in international trade will be  heavy users of short term borrowing finance. </p>

                <div>
                  <p><strong>Short Term Financing and Lenders </strong> <br />
                    Lenders favor  businesses that exhibit strong management, steady growth potential and reliable  projected cash flow (demonstrating the business ability to pay the monthly  interest payments on this line of credit from its projected. <br />
                    However Lenders  normally charge a higher base rate of interest for operating loans reflecting  this relatively weaker security position </p>

                <div>
                  <p><strong>Example of Short Term Financing  Sources </strong> <br />
                    There are many methods  for which a firm can seek short terms financing some of these include: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Overdrafts </li>
                    <li>Short-term loans </li>

                  <p><strong>Long  Term Financing </strong> <br />
                    Provides information  on long term financing including financing sources and products. <br />
                    <strong>What is long term financing? </strong> <br />
                    Long term financing  provides capital deficit businesses funds for the period over 1 year. It  contrasts to short term financing because short term financing provides funds  for the period of 1 year or less Whether an established corporation or new  business entity it is common that many small and large companies have some kind  of debt throughout the life of their business. <br />
                    These  businesses normally turn to lenders not only to expand their companies or to  purchase equipment, but also to finance operating capital to even out cash  flow. </p>
