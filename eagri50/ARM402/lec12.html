				<p><strong>Technical Feasibility</strong></p>
				<p><strong>            </strong>The technical analysis concerns  the projects inputs (supplies) and outputs (production) of real goods and  services.  It is extremely important, and  the project framework must be defined clearly enough to permit the technical  analysis to be through and precise.  The  other aspects of project analysis can only proceed in light of the technical  analysis, although the technical assumptions of a project plan will most likely  need to be revised as the other aspects are examined in detail.  Good technical staffs are essential for this  work; they may be drawn from consulting firms or technical assistance agencies  abroad.  They will be more effective if  they have a good understanding of the <br />
				  various aspects of project  analysis, but technical staff, no matter how competent, cannot work effectively  if they are not given adequate time or if they do not have the sympathetic  cooperation and informed supervision of planning officials.</p>
				<p><strong>Marketing  Feasibility </strong></p>
				<p><strong>I. INTRODUCTION </strong><br />
				  A. Describe your  background, relevant experience<br />
				  B. Your goals and  objectives: at least sales and net income, time frame </p>
				<p><strong>II. PRODUCT  MARKET DEFINITION </strong><br />
				  A. Customer Need –  Discuss the fundamental, underlying customer need. <br />
				  B. Generic Product  Class – Discuss the category of product types <u>which customers believe </u>are  substitute in satisfying the underlying need. </p>
				<p><strong>III. CUSTOMER  PROFILE </strong></p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>If your product competes directly       with other brands within one product type, develop a profile of customers       who buy or may buy this product type. </li>
				  <li>If your product is a unique       offering and the only member of a product type, then describe the <u>customers </u>who buy your product as well as <u>customers </u>of what you think are       the closest substitute(s).</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>Justify your choice of (1) or (2) and develop a customer profile.</p>
				<ol start="3" type="1">
                  <li>Description of Customers –       Describe the market segment.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>-For <u>consumer </u>markets: <br />
				  <u>First</u>,  segment the market on benefits sought. How does the customer want to satisfy  the need identified in #2.<br />
				  <u>Then </u>describe the market segment in other ways: usage situations, usage rates,  activities or interests, demographics, life-style, etc.<br />
				  - For <u>industrial </u>(organizational)  markets: <br />
				  <u>First</u>,  segment the market on benefits sought. How does the customer want to satisfy  the need identified in #2.<br />
				  2? <u>Then </u>describe the market segment in other ways: usage situations, usage  rates, activities or interests, demographics, life-style, etc.</p>
				<p><strong>IV. COMPETITOR PROFILE </strong><br />
				  A.     Industry Analysis <br />
				  -Industry structure <br />
				  -Industry size and growth rate <br />
				  -Anticipated industry changes <br />
				  -Industry marketing practices <br />
				  B.    Key  Competitors (those with the biggest market share OR those whose offerings are  the closest substitutes for your offering)<br />
				  (1)      If  the your product competes directly with other products at the brand level  within one product type, then key competitors are those firms which sell  offerings of this product type. <br />
				  (2)        If the client’s product is a unique offering and the only member of a product  type, then key competitors are those firms which supply the product which  customers believe is the closest substitute.<br />
				  Justify  your choice of (1) or (2) and develop a key competitor profile. Be sure you  analyze the firm and not the product.<br />
				  - Describe key competitors <br />
				  - Discuss their major strengths and  weaknesses <br />
				  - Analyze their goals, objectives,  and likely moves if you enter </p>
				<p><strong>V. MARKET SIZE ESTIMATION </strong><br />
				  Describe  method used, its limitations and your assumptions. You may want to create a  range of potentials / forecasts based on different assumptions. </p>
				<p>A. Market  Potential &amp; Market Forecast <br />
				  What is  the potential (upper limit on total units sold or sales dollars under ideal  conditions) for this market (i.e., product type)? What is the market forecast  (total industry sales that can be realistically expected under conditions)?</p>
				<p>B. Sales potential  &amp; Sales Forecast <br />
				  What  level of sales might your firm be able to achieve under ideal conditions? What  level of sales can your firm expect to achieve given competition, capabilities  of firm. etc.?</p>
				<p><strong>VI. EVALUATE  THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY </strong><br />
				  Your evaluation of whether this is a  good opportunity and why?<br />
				  -How well does your product offering  meet customer wants/requirements?<br />
				  -How well are competitors meeting  customer wants/requirements?<br />
				  -How well does the opportunity meet  the client’s expectations?</p>
