				<p>The oligosaccharides commonly  encountered in nature belong to disaccharides. </p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>The       physiologically important disaccharides are maltose, lactose, trehalose       and sucrose.</li>
				  <li>Disaccharides       consist of two monosaccharides joined covalently by an O-glycosidic bond. </li>
				  <li>The       hydroxyl group formed as a result of hemiacetal formation is highly       reactive when compared to other hydroxyl groups. </li>
				  <li>This       hydroxyl group present in one monosaccharide reacts with any one of the       hydroxyl groups attached to C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, or C-6 of another       monosaccharide to produce 1→1, 1→2, 1→3, 1→4, and 1→6 linked       disaccharides. </li>
				  <li>When       only one anomeric carbon is involved in glycosidic bond formation,       reducing disaccharides are formed.</li>
				  <li> If both anomeric carbon atoms of       monosaccharides are involved in glycosidic bond formation that results in       the formation of a non-reducing disaccharides such as trehalose       (aldosyl-aldosyl disaccharide) or sucrose (aldosyl-ketosyl disaccharide)'. </li>
				  <li>In       the case of reducing disaccharides, one end of the molecule having free       anomeric carbon is called reducing end and the other end, where the       anomeric carbon is involved in glycosidic bond, is called as non-reducing       end </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Reducing  disaccharides</strong><br />
                    <strong>Maltose</strong></p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Maltose is a disaccharide made up of <strong>two glucose residue</strong> joined by a <strong>glycosidic linkage</strong> between C-1 of       one glucose residue and C-4 of the other. </li>
				  <li>The       configuration of the anomeric carbon of glucose involved in the linkage is <strong></strong>and hence the glycosidic       linkage is <strong></strong><strong>(1→ 4).</strong> </li>
				  <li>The       anomeric carbon atom of the second glucose is free and therefore maltose       is a <strong>reducing sugar.</strong></li>
				  <li>The       second glucose residue is capable of existing in <strong>or       </strong>configuration </li>
				  <li>Maltose       has been recorded occasionally in plants. It is usually obtained as a       product of the <strong>enzyme hydrolysis of       starch</strong> during germination or malting process.</li>

				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Trehalose,       a non-reducing disaccharide., occurs as a major constituent of the       circulating fluid (hemolymph) of insects and serves as an energy storage       compound. </li>
				  <li>It       is also present to a limited extent in the fat body of a variety of       insects. </li>
				  <li>It       gives twice the amount of energy as that of glucose and at the same time       maintains the osmotic balance.</li>
				  <li> It has been described as an important       adaptation of insects engaged in flight.</li>
				  <li> The anomeric carbons of both glucose       moieties are involved in the formation of glycosidic bond. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Sucrose</strong></p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Sucrose,       a sugar of commercial importance, is widely distributed in higher plants.</li>
				  <li><strong>Sugarcane and       sugar beet</strong> are the sole commercial sources. </li>
				  <li>It       is made up of <strong>glucose and fructose</strong>.</li>
				  <li>The       anomeric carbon atom of glucose (C-1) and fructose (C-2) are involved in       linkage and is therefore a <strong>non-reducing       disaccharide</strong> </li>
				  <li>Sucrose       is a major <strong>intermediate product of       photosynthesis</strong> and it is the principal form in which sugar is       transported from the leaves to other portions of plants via their vascular       systems.</li>

				<p><strong>Invert  sugar</strong></p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>The       hydrolysis of sucrose when followed polarimetrically the optical rotation       changes from <strong>positive (dextro-) </strong>to<strong> negative (levo</strong>-). </li>
				  <li>The       dextrorotatory sucrose on hydrolysis yield levorotatory mixture of glucose       and fructose.</li>
				  <li>The       levorotaion is due to the presence of fructose which is by itself more       levorotatory (-92)       than dextrorototary glucose (+52.2). </li>
				  <li>This       phenomenon is called inversion and the mixture of glucose and fructose is       called invert sugar.</li>
				  <li>This       reaction is catalysed by the <strong>enzyme       invertase.</strong> </li>
				  <li>Invert       sugar is more sweeter than sucrose.</li>
				  <li>Honey       contains plenty of invert sugar and therefore is very sweet.</li>

				<h1>Sucrosyl oligosaccharides</h1>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>The <strong>degree of polymerization (DP</strong>)       of sucrosyl oligosaccharides normally ranges from 3 to 9. </li>
				  <li>Though       sucrose is found at higher concentration in all plants, members of the       sucrosyl oligosaccharides occur at least in traces in each plant family. </li>
				  <li>The       main accumulation of surosyl oligosaccharides is found in <strong>storage organs such as roots, rhizomes       and seeds. </strong></li>
				  <li>The       important members of sucrosyl oligosaccharides are <strong>raffinose (DP-3), stachyose (DP-4), verbascose (DP-5) and ajugose       (DP-6). </strong></li>
				  <li>All       sucrosyl oligosaccharides are <strong>non-reducing</strong> in nature .</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Raffinose </strong></p>
				<ul>
				
				    <li>It  occupies the second position next to sucrose in abundance in the plant kingdom. </li>
				    <li>Raffinose  occurs only at low concentration in the leaves of leguminous plants, but  accumulates in the storage organs such as seeds and roots. </li>
				    <li>Most  of the leguminous seeds contain these oligosaccharides in large amounts. </li>
				    <li>Bengal  gram has higher amounts of raffinose.</li>
				    <li>Red  gam and green gram have significantly high amounts of verbascose and stachyose  than Bengal gram and black gram. </li>
				    <li>These  sucrosyl oligosaccharides are responsible for <strong>flatulence</strong> following     the  consumption of these legumes. </li>
				    <li>It  serve as  <strong>reserve material</strong>.</li>
				    <li>It  also contributes to <strong>frost resistance</strong> <strong></strong></li>

				<p><strong>Polysaccharides</strong><br />
				  The  polysaccharides found in nature either serve a structural function (structural  polysaccharides) or play a role as a stored form of energy (storage  polysaccharides).</p>
				<p> <strong>Storage polysaccharides</strong></p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Starch,       galactomanans and inulin are important storage polysaccharides in plants.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Starch</strong></p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>The       principal food-reserve polysaccharide in the plant kingdom is starch. </li>
				  <li>It       forms the major source of carbohydrate in the human diet. </li>
				  <li>Starch       has been found in some protozoa, bacteria and algae. But the major source       is plants where it occurs in the seeds, fruits, leaves, tubers and bulbs       in varying amount from a few percent to over 74%. </li>
				  <li>Starch       is an alpha-glucan that has structurally distinct components called       amylose and amylopectin.</li>
				  <li>A       third component referred as the intermediate fraction has also been       identified in some starches. </li>
				  <li>Starch       molecules are organized into quasicrystalline macromolecular aggregates       called granules. </li>
				  <li>The       shape of the granules are characteristics of the source of the starch. </li>
				  <li>The       two components, amylose and amylopectin, vary in amount among the       different sources from less than 2% of amylose in waxy rice or waxy maize       to about 80% amylose in amylomaize. </li>
				  <li>The       majority of starches contain 15 to 35% of amylose. </li>
				  <li>The       ratio of amylose and amylopectin is a function of the enzymes, <strong>granulosis bound starch synthase       (GBSS) and soluble starch synthase (SSS). </strong></li>
				  <li>GBSS       is able to synthesise amylose in a form that is not a substrate for       branching enzyme to form amylopectin. </li>
				  <li>Waxy       mutants containing only amylopectin lack the GBSS but still contain       soluble starch synthase.</li>

				<p align="center"><strong><img width="660" height="276" src="lec03_clip_image005.jpg" /></strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Amylose is made up of - D-glucose units  linked mostly in a linear way by  4 linkages </li>
				  <li>It has a molecular weight of  150,000 to 1,000,000 depending on its biological origin. </li>
				  <li>It has been shown that  amylose has some elements of nonlinearity.</li>
				  <li>It consists of a mixture of  linear molecules with limited, long-chain branching involving  1 -6 linkages. </li>
				  <li>The branches contain several  hundred glucose residues. </li>
				  <li>Amylose gives a  characteristic blue color with iodine due to the ability of the iodine to  occupy a position in the interior of a helical coil of glucose units. </li>
				  <li>Pure amylose binds 20% of  iodine at 20C</li>

				  <li>It       contains 94-96% 14       and 4-6% - 16       linkages. </li>
				  <li>The       molecular weight of amylopectin is in the order of 107 - 108. </li>
				  <li>Robin       and co-workers have proposed a model for amylopectin</li>
				  <li>In       this model, A and B chains are linear and have degree of polymerization as       15 and 45 respectively. </li>
				  <li>The       B chain form the backbone of the amylopectin molecule and extend over two       or more clusters. </li>
				  <li>Each       cluster of A chain are primarily responsible for the crystalline regions       within the granule. </li>
				  <li>The       intercrystalline regions occur at regular intervals (60 - 70 A) containing the       majority of -       1 - 6 linkages. </li>

				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Inulin       is a non-digestible fructosyl oligosaccharide found naturally in more than       36000 types of plants. </li>
				  <li>It       is a storage polysaccharide found in onion, garlic, chicory, artichoke,       asparagus, banana, wheat and rye. </li>
				  <li>It       consists of mainly,if not exclusively, of - 2-&gt;1 fructosyl-fructose links</li>
				  <li>A       starting glucose moiety can be present,but is not necessary.</li>

				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Cellulose       is the most abundant organic substance found in nature. </li>
				  <li>It       is the principal constituent of cell walls in higher plants.</li>
				  <li> It occurs in almost pure form (98%) in       cotton fibres and to a lessor extent in flax (80%), jute (60-70%), wood       (40-50%) and cereal straws (30-43%). </li>
				  <li>It       is linear, unbranched homoglycan of 10,000 to 15,000 D-glucose units       joined by -14 linkages</li>
				  <li>The       structure of cellulose can be represented as a series of glucopyranose       rings in the chair conformation. </li>
				  <li>The       most stable conformation for the polymer is the chair turned 180relative       to the adjacent glucose residues yielding a straight extended chain. </li>
				  <li>Celluose       molecules within the plant cell walls are organized into biological units       of structure known as microfibrils. </li>
				  <li>A       microfibril consists of a bundle of cellulose molecules arranged with its       long axis parallel to that of the others. </li>
				  <li>This       arrangement permits the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonding       between the hydroxyl group of C-3 of one glucose residue and the pyranose       ring oxygen atom of the next glucose residue. </li>
				  <li>This       hydrogen bond impart a double bond character to the glycosidic bond and       impedes the rotation of adjacent glucose residues around the glycosidic       bond.</li>
				  <li> Within the microfibril, the adjacent       cellulose molecules are linked by intermolecular hydrogen bond between C-6       hydroxyl group of one molecule and the glycosidic bond oxygen atom of       adjacent cellulose molecule </li>
				  <li>The       cross section of the microfibril consists of a central crystalline core of       about 5–30 nm short diameters. </li>
				  <li>The       central crystalline core contains around 50-100 cellulose molecules which       are arranged in perfect three dimensional array and exhibits a crystalline       structure.</li>
				  <li> Surrounding this crystalline core is a       region of paracrystalline matrix which contains about 100 polysaccharide       molecules of cellulose and hemicellulose </li>
				  <li>This       region does not have perfect three-dimensional order and water molecules       are able to penetrate the paracrystalline region but not the crystalline       core. </li>

				<p><strong>Chemical properties of carbohydrates</strong><br />
				  Monosaccharides<br />
				  Reactions  of monosaccharides are due to the presence of hydroxyl (-OH) and the  potentially free aldehyde (-CHO) or keto ( &gt;C=O) groups.<br />
  <strong>Reaction  with alkali</strong><br />
				  Dilute alkali</p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Sugars       in weak alkaline solutions undergo isomerization to form 1,2-enediol       followed by the formation of a mixture of sugars. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Strong alkali<br />
				  Under strong alkaline conditions sugar  undergo caramelization reactions.</p>
				<p><strong>Reducing  property of sugars</strong></p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Sugars       are classified as either reducing or non-reducing depending upon the       presence of potentially free aldehyde or keto groups. </li>
				  <li>The       reducing property is mainly due to the ability of these sugars to reduce       metal ions such as copper or silver to form insoluble cuprous oxide, under       alkaline condition. </li>
				  <li>The       aldehyde group of aldoses is oxidized to carboxylic acid. This       reducingproperty is the basis for qualitative (Fehling's, Benedict's,       Barfoed's and Nylander's tests) and quantitative reactions.</li>
				  <li>All       monosaccharides are reducing. In the case of oligosaccharides, if the       molecule possesses a free aldehyde or ketone group it belongs to reducing       sugar (maltose and lactose). </li>
				  <li>If       the reducing groups are involved in the formation of glycosodic linkage.,       the sugar belongs to the non- reducing group (trehalose, sucrose,       raffinose and stachyose).</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Reaction  with phenylhydrazine</strong></p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>When       reducing sugars are heated with phenylhydrazine at pH 4.7 a yellow       precipitate is obtained. </li>
				  <li>The       precipitated compound is called as osazone. One molecule of reducing sugar       reacts with three molecules of phenylhydrazine. </li>
				  <li>D-mannose       and D-fructose form same type of osazone as that of D-glucose since the       configuration of C-3, C-4, C-5 and C-6 is same for all the three sugars. </li>
				  <li>The       osazone of D-galactose is different.</li>
				  <li> Different sugars form osazone at       different rates. For example, D-fructose forms osazone more readily than       D-glucose.</li>
				  <li>The       osazones are crystalline solids with characteristic shapes, decomposition       points and specific optical rotations. </li>
				  <li>The       time of formation and crystalline shape of osazone is utilized for       identification of sugars. </li>
				  <li>If       methyl phenylhydrazine is used instead of phenylhydrazine in the preparation       of osazone, only ketoses react. </li>
				  <li>This       reaction serves to distinguish between aldose and ketose sugars.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p> 
                    <strong>Reaction  with acids</strong></p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Monosaccharides       are generally stable to hot dilute mineral acids though ketoses are       appreciably decomposed by prolonged action.</li>
				  <li> Heating a solution of hexoses in a strong       non-oxidising acidic conditions, hydroxyl methyl furfural is formed. </li>
				  <li>The       hydroxymethyl furfural from hexose is usually oxidized further to other       products When phenolic compounds such as resorcinol, -naphthol or       anthrone are added, mixture of coloured compounds are formed </li>
				  <li>The       molisch test used for detecting carbohydrate in solution is based on this       principle. </li>
				  <li>When       conc. H2SO4 is added slowly to a carbohydrate solution containing -naphthol, a pink color       is produced at the juncture. </li>
			
				  <li>The heat generated during  the reaction hydrolyse and dehydrate it to produce furfural or hydroxymethyl  furfural which then react with -naphthol to produce the pink color.</li>
