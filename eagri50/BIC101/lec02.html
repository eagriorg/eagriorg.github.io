				</p>
				<p align="left">			    The  simplest monosaccharide that possesses a hydroxyl group and a carbonyl group  with an asymmetric carbon atom is the <strong>aldotriose  -glyceraldehyde</strong>. (A carbon is said to be asymmetric if four different groups  or atoms are attached to it. The carbon is also called as a chiral center).</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Glyceraldehyde is considered  as a reference compound and it exists in two optically active forms, D and L</li>
			    </ul>
				<p> The  two families of monosaccharides, D-and L occur based on the configuration of D  and L glyceraldehydes. In general, the D-family of sugars occur in nature.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>For  monosaccharides with two or more asymmetric carbons, the prefixes D or L refer  to the configuration of the penultimate carbon (i.e, the asymmetric carbon  farthest from the carbonyl carbon). </li>
				  <li>If  the hydroxyl group on the <strong>penultimate </strong>carbon  is on the <strong>right-hand side</strong> of the  carbon chain when the aldehyde or ketone group is written at the top of the  formula it belongs to the <strong>D family</strong> and if on the <strong>left hand side</strong> it belongs  to <strong>L family</strong>. The D or L has nothing  to do with optical activity. D sugars may be dextro- or levorotatory. </li>
				  <li>The  important monosaccharides containing aldehyde group belonging to the D family  are </li>
				  <li> the  aldotetrose  - D-erythrose</li>
				  <li>the  aldopentoses - D-ribose, D-arabinose and D-xylose</li>
				  <li>the  aldohexoses - D-glucose, D-mannose and D-galactose</li>
				  <li>The  important monosaccharide belonging to the L-family is L-arabinose.</li>
				  <li>The  important ketoses are </li>
				  <ul>
				    <li>Ketotriose  - dihydroxy acetone (It is optically inactive since there is no asymmetric  carbon);</li>
			      </ul>
				  <li> the  ketotetrose -  D-erythrulose; </li>
				  <li>the  ketopentoses -  D-ribulose and D-xylulose </li>
				  <li>the  ketohexose -   D-fructose </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Cyclic structure of Monosaccharides:</strong><br />
				  The  monosaccharides exist either in cyclic or acyclic form. There are many evidences  to show that the pentose and hexose monosaccharides are present in cyclic form.  The evidences are 1. Glucose and other aldoses fail to give the Schiff 's test  for aldehydes. 2. Solid glucose is quite inert to oxygen whereas aldehydes are  easily auto-oxidizable. 3. Glucose and other aldoses do not form bisulfite or  aldehyde ammonia compound. 4.Glucose pentaacetate does not react with  hydroxylamine. 5. Presence of two forms of glucose with different physical and  chemical properties. 6. X-ray analysis definitely proves the existence of the  ring structure and also the size of the ring. 7. Mutarotation.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>When an aldehyde or a ketone  group is present in a molecule that also possesses hydroxyl groups, an <strong>intramolecular arrangement</strong> may occur to  form a <strong>hemiacetal or a hemiketal</strong>,  respectively. This intramolecular hemiacetal or hemiketal is the basis for the  cyclic structure of the sugars. Hence, <strong>Haworth </strong>(an English chemist) proposed a cyclic hemiacetal structure that accounts  completely for its chemical properties </li>

				<ul>
				  <li>Two types of ring structures  are possible, <strong>the five-membered furanose </strong>and <strong>the six-membered pyranose ring</strong> if the carbonyl group interact with hydroxyl group. These names are derived  from the parent compounds 'furan' and 'pyran'. </li>
				  <li> The most common ring structure for aldohexoses<strong> </strong>is the<strong> pyranose ring</strong> structure that involves the first carbonyl carbon  and the hydroxyl group attached to the fifth carbon. </li>
				  <li>The <strong>furanose ring</strong> structure is formed by interaction of carbonyl carbon  with the hydroxyl group attached to the fourth carbon. This <strong>furanose</strong> form is <strong>less stable</strong> than the pyranose strucure and is not very common among  aldohexoses.</li>
				  <li> Very seldom is a seven-membered ring formed.</li>
				  <li>Fructose exists in solution  and in compounds as a furanose; however, in the crystalline state only the  pyranose ring is believed to exist. </li>
				  <li><strong>Ribose</strong> occurs as the <strong>furanose structure</strong> in  many important biological compounds.</li>
				  <li>A <strong>new asymmetric carbon</strong> is introduced in the molecule due to this  rearrangement. As a result of this new asymmetric centre, two isomers are  formed.  <strong></strong></li>
				  <li>Isomeric forms of  monosaccharides that differ only in their configuration about the hemiacetal or  hemiketal carbon atom are called <strong>anomers </strong>and the carbon is referred as <strong>anomeric  carbon. </strong></li>
				  <li>When the newly formed  hydroxyl group in C1and the ring are on the same orientation, it is <strong>a</strong><strong> - anomer</strong>. </li>
				  <li>When the newly formed  hydroxyl group in C1 and the ring are on opposite orientation, it  is  <strong>b</strong><strong> - anomer</strong>.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>While  writing the cyclic form (Haworth) of monosaccharides it is sometimes difficult  to judge whether an OH group should be above or below the plane of the ring.<br />
				  A few rules can be followed for writing  Haworth's structure for carbohydrates.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Write  the <strong>oxygen</strong> at the upper right hand  corner of the ring structure (pyranose) and the carbons clockwise around the  ring. At the fifth carbon it is necessary to rotate the bond to 90o    to make the ring closure. For the  D-family of sugars, it is customary to write the terminal CH2OH  above the plane of the ring. </li>
				  <li>If  the<strong> hydroxyl group or hydrogen atom  occurs on the right-hand side</strong> of the carbon chain in the linear structure  it is <strong>placed below the plane of the ring</strong> in the cyclic structure. </li>
				  <li>Conversely,  if the <strong>hydroxyl group or hydrogen atom  is on the left-hand side</strong> of the carbon chain, it is placed <strong>above the plane of the ring</strong> in the  structure formula  </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Conformational  structure:</strong><br />
				  The six-membered pyranose ring is not  actually planar, as suggested by Haworth, but assume usually the <strong>stable chair conformation</strong>. </p>

				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>The       substituents are represented either axially or equatorially.</li>
				  <li>The       axial substituents project almost parallel with the vertical axis through       the ring </li>
				  <li>The       equatorial substituents project roughly perpendicular to this axis. </li>
				  <li>Substituents       in the equatorial positions are less sterically hindered by neighbouring       substituents. Conformations with their bulky substituents in equatorial       positions are favoured.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Derived monosaccharides</strong><br />
				  The  important functional groups present in monosaccharides are hydroxyl and  carbonyl groups. The hydroxyl group forms esters, usually with phosphoric acid  or is replaced by a hydrogen or amino group. The carbonyl group undergoes  reduction or oxidation to produce number of derived monosaccharides.<br />
  <strong>a)  Deoxysugars</strong></p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>In       sugars, the hydroxyl group is replaced by a hydrogen to produce deoxy       sugars (devoid of oxygen). </li>
				  <li>The       important deoxy sugar is <strong>2-deoxy       ribose</strong> that occurs in deoxy ribonucleic acid. </li>
				  <li>Other       important deoxy sugars are L-fucose and L. rhamnose. The substitution of       the hydroxyl group at C-6 of L. galactose or L.mannose with hydrogen       produces fucose or rhamnose respectively. </li>
				  <li>L-fucose       occurs in the cell wall polysaccharides namely hemicelluloses and       L-rhamnose occurs in pectic polysaccharides namely rhamnogalacturonan.       These deoxy sugars are also found in the complex oligosaccharide       components of glycoproteins and glycolipids.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>b) <strong>Amino  sugars</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The hydroxyl group, usually  at <strong>C-2</strong>, is replaced by an amino  group to produce aminosugars such as glucosamine, galactosamine and  mannosamine. </li>
				  <li>The amino group may be  condensed with acetic acid to produce N-acetyl amino sugars, for example, <strong>N-acetyl glucosamine. </strong></li>
				  <li>This glucosamine derivative  is important constituent of many structural polymers (<strong>chitin, bacterial cell wall polysaccharides </strong>etc.)</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>c)  <strong>Polyols (alditols)</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Both aldoses and ketoses are  reduced to <strong>polyhydric alcohols (polyols)</strong> when treated with enzymes, sodium amalgam, and hydrogen under high pressure  with catalyst or sodium borohydride. </li>
				  <li>Each aldose yields the  corresponding alcohol upon reduction </li>
				  <li>A ketose forms two alcohols  because of the appearance of a new asymmetric carbon atom in the process. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>By this reduction process, the following  sugars give rise to their respective alcohols under specified conditions.<br />
				  Glucose                       Sorbitol<br />
				  Fructose                      Sorbitol  and mannitol<br />
				  Mannose                      Mannitol<br />
				  Glyceraldehyde          Glycerol<br />
				  Erythrose                     Erythritol<br />
				  Ribose                          Ribitol<br />
				  Galactose                     Dulcitol</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Polyols  occur in many plant products.</li>
				  <li>Sorbitol  was first isolated from the berries of mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia).</li>
				  <li>Commercially  sorbitol is manufactured by the hydrogenation of glucose.</li>
				  <li>Mannitol  occurs in many terrestrial and marine plants. </li>
				  <li>Potential  food applications of polyols include <strong>confectionery  products, bakery products, deserts, jams and marmalade.</strong></li>
				  <li> Sorbitol is an <strong>excellent moisture conditioner</strong> and is used in pharmaceutical  preparations such as elixirs and syrups. </li>
				  <li>Sorbitol,  as a <strong>humectant</strong> in creams and lotions  helps to stabilize the water content, providing better moisture control. </li>
				  <li>The  use of sorbitol or xylitol in toothpaste and mouthwashes is highly desirable.</li>
			    </ul>
		
				<p><strong>d) Oxidation products</strong><br />
				  When  aldoses are oxidized under proper conditions with different types of oxidizing  agents, three types of acids are produced, namely <strong>aldonic acids, uronic acids and aldaric acids or saccharic acids.</strong><br />
  <strong>Aldonic  acid</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Oxidation  of an aldose  with bromine water at  neutral pH converts the aldehyde group (C1) to a carboxyl group  yields <strong>Aldonic  acid</strong>.</li>
				  <li> Hydrobromous acid formed by the reaction of  water with bromine acts as an oxidizing agent.  </li>
				  <li>Ketoses  are not readily oxidized by bromine water. </li>
				  <li>Aldoses  are not only oxidized by bromine water but also by the alkaline iodine  solution.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Uronic  acid</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>When  aldoses are oxidised with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) uronic  acids are formed. </li>
				  <li>In  this reaction only primary alcohol group(C6) is oxidized to carboxyl  group, whereas the aldehyde group remains unchanged.</li>
				  <li> Uronic acids are constituents of pectic  polysaccharides.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Aldaric  or saccharic acid</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>When  aldoses are oxidised with nitric acid, <strong>saccharic  acids</strong> are formed. </li>
				  <li>Both  aldehyde (C1)and primary alcohol groups (C6) are oxidised  to carboxyl groups.</li>
				  <li> Glucose on oxidation with nitric acid produces <strong>glucaric or glucosaccharic acid</strong>.</li>
				  <li> The aldaric acid produced from galactose is  called as <strong>mucic acid</strong>.</li>
			    </ul>
