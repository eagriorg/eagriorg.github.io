				<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Carbohydrates  are major sources of energy for living organisms.  </li>
				  <li>The <strong>chief source of carbohydrate</strong> in  human food is <strong>starch</strong>, which is the  storage form of glucose in plants. </li>
				  <li>Plants  may store relatively large amounts of starch within their own cells in time of  abundant supply, to be used later by the plant itself when there is a <strong>demand for energy production.</strong> </li>
				  <li><strong>Glycogen</strong> is the glucose storage polysaccharide of animals.  </li>
				  <li>It  accounts for upto 10% of the mass of the liver and one percent of the mass of  the muscle.  </li>
				  <li>Glycogen  is larger and highly branched than amylopectin.  </li>
				  <li>By  the action of several enzymes, such as   <strong>-amylase, </strong><strong>-amylase,  amylo </strong><strong>(1</strong><strong>®</strong><strong>6) glucosidase and </strong><strong>µ</strong><strong>(1</strong><strong>®</strong><strong>4) glucosidase, </strong>starch  and glycogen from dietary intake are degraded finally to glucose.</li>
				  <li>Carbohydrate  is utilized by cells mainly in the form of glucose.  </li>
				  <li>The  three principal monosaccharides resulting from the digestive processes are <strong>glucose, fructose and galactose</strong>.  </li>
				  <li>Both  fructose and galactose are readily converted to glucose by the liver. </li>
				  <li>Pentose  sugars such as xylose, arabinose and ribose may be present in the diet, but  their fate after absorption is obscure.  </li>
				  <li>Since  glucose is the compound formed from starch and glycogen, the carbohydrate  metabolism commences with this monosaccharide.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>  The major metabolic processes in  carbohydrates are: <br />
                    <strong>i. Glycolysis:  </strong><br />
				  Glycolysis is the sequence of  reactions that convert <strong>glucose into pyruvate</strong> with the concomitant trapping of the energy as ATP. <br />
  <strong>ii. The citric acid cycle:</strong><br />
				  It  is the final <strong>common oxidative pathway  for carbohydrates, fats and proteins</strong>.   It is also a source of precursors for biosynthesis of various  biomolecules.  The <strong>acetyl CoA</strong> that enters in this pathway is completely oxidised to <strong>carbon dioxide and water</strong> with  concomitant production of reducing equivalents, namely <strong>NADH and FADH2.  </strong><br />
  <strong>iii.  The hexose monophosphate shunt</strong>:<br />
				  It is an <strong>alternative pathway</strong> to the glycolytic pathway and the citric acid  cycle for the oxidation of glucose to carbon dioxide and water with the <strong>generation of reduced nicotinamide adenine  dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) molecules and ribose 5-phosphate. </strong><br />
  <strong>iv.  Gluconeogenesis</strong>: <br />
				  It is a biosynthetic pathway that  generates <strong>glucose from non-carbohydrate  precursors.</strong><br />
  <strong>v.  Glycogenesis:  </strong><br />
				  It is a pathway by which <strong>glycogen is synthesised</strong> from glucose.<br />
  <strong>vi.  Glycogenolysis</strong>:  <br />
  <strong>Glycolysis</strong> </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Glycolysis,  also called as <strong>Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas  pathway (EMP pathway),</strong> consists of a series of reactions through which  glucose is converted to pyruvate with the concomitant production of relatively  small amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). </li>
				  <li> It is derived from the Greek stem '<strong>glykys'</strong> meaning sweet and <strong>'lysis' </strong>meaning splitting.  </li>
				  <li> It is the primary pathway occurring in the  cytoplasm of all the tissues of biological systems.   </li>
				  <li>All  the enzymes responsible for the catalysis are found in the <strong>extra-mitochondrial soluble fraction of the cells (cytoplasm). </strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p>     In plants, glucose and fructose are the  main monosaccharides catabolised by glycolysis although others are also  converted into these sugars. </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Glucose  entering the glycolysis is derived from <strong>starch  or sucrose</strong>, and fructose is derived from <strong>sucrose.  </strong></li>
				  <li>The  starch is either from seeds or chloroplasts of matured plants.</li>
				  <li> Glycolysis normally takes place in the <strong>presence of O2</strong> in higher plant cells. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>     The enzymes in the cytoplasm catalyse the  reactions involved in the conversion of <strong>glucose  to pyruvate</strong> .<br />
				  The  series of reactions indicated take place in 3 stages.<br />
  <strong>Stage 1:  Conversion of glucose to fructose  1,6-bisphosphate</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The  formation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate takes place in three steps catalysed by  enzymes.</li>
				  <li> The purpose of these reactions is to form a  compound that can be readily cleaved into phosphorylated three carbon units  from which, through a series of reactions,   ATP is formed.</li>
				  <li>After  the <strong>first phosphorylation</strong> reaction  to form glucose 6-phosphate, isomerisation of glucose 6-phosphate to <strong>fructose-6-phosphate</strong> occurs which is  conversion of an aldose into a ketose. </li>
				  <li> A second phosphorylation reaction follows the  isomerization, catalysed by <strong>phosphofructokinase</strong> resulting in the formation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.  </li>
				  <li><strong>Phosphofructokinase</strong> is the key enzyme in the control of glycolysis.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Stage 2: Conversion of  fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to 3-phosphoglycerate.</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The <strong>splitting of</strong> <strong>fructose 1,6-bisphosphate</strong> occurs in the second stage of glycolysis  resulting in the formation of a molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and a  molecule of dihydroxyacetone phosphate catalysed by <strong>aldolase.</strong>  </li>
				  <li>The  dihydroxyacetone phosphate is isomerised to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate  by <strong>phosphotriose  isomerase.</strong>  The isomerisation  reaction is rapid and reversible.  </li>
				  <li>In  the next step, glyceraldehyde 3- phosphate is oxidised to  1,3-bisphosphoglycerate catalyzed by <strong>glyceraldehyde  3-phosphate dehydrogenase.  </strong></li>
				  <li>The  product is further converted into 3-phosphoglycerate and a molecule of ATP is  formed.  The phosphorylation of ADP to  ATP is called <strong>substrate level  phosphorylation</strong> since the phosphate group from a substrate molecule is  transferred to ADP. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Stage 3: Formation of  pyruvate  </strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>An intramolecular  rearrangement of the phosphoryl group occurs resulting in the formation of 2-<strong>phosphoglycerate from 3-phosphoglycerate  catalyzed by phosphoglycerate</strong> <strong>mutase. </strong></li>
				  <li>The 2-phosphoglycerate  formed undergoes <strong>dehydration </strong>forming  phosphoenolpyruvate which gives rise to pyruvate and a molecule of ATP  (substrate level phosphorylation). </li>
				  <li> The reaction is irreversible and catalyzed by <strong>pyruvate kinase.  </strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p>The  net reaction in the transformation of glucose to pyruvate is </p>
				<p><strong>Glucose  + 2 Pi + 2ADP + 2 NAD+  ---</strong><strong>  2 pyruvate + 2 ATP + 2 NADH + 2 H+ + H<sub>2</sub>O</strong></p>
				<p>            
				  Once  pyruvate is formed, further degradation is determined by the <strong>presence or absence of oxygen.</strong><br />
  <strong>Under anaerobic conditions</strong>,  in one of the pathways, pyruvate undergoes reduction yielding <strong>lactic acid.</strong>  <br />
				  The  formation of lactic acid is very rare in plants with exception of potato tubers  maintained under anaerobic condition and some green algae.                    <br />
				  In  the second pathway, pyruvate is converted to <strong>ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide</strong>.   The <strong>alcoholic fermentation</strong> is  the basis of the beer and wine-making industries.<br />
				  Under <strong>aerobic conditions</strong>, pyruvate is <strong>oxidatively decarboxylated to acetyl CoA</strong> which is then completely  oxidised to CO2 and water through the <strong>citric acid cycle</strong><br />
  <strong>Energetics of  glycolysis</strong><br />
				  From glucose, two molecules of  glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate are formed in the second stage of glycolysis from  which two molecules of pyruvate are obtained as end products of  glycolysis.  Hence energetic of  glycolysis is calculated by taking into account two molecules of glyceraldehyde  3-phosphate.<strong> </strong><br />

				<p><strong>Significance of glycolysis</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Glycolysis  is an almost <strong>universal central pathway</strong> of glucose catabolism occurring in the cytoplasm of all the tissues of  biological systems leading to generation of energy in the form of ATP for vital  activities.  </li>
				  <li>It  is the pathway through which the <strong>largest  flux of carbon</strong> occurs in most cells.  </li>
				  <li>Some  plant tissues which are modified for the storage of starch   such as potato tubers and some plants adapted  to growth in inundated water such as water cress derive most of their energy  from glycolysis. </li>
				  <li> In plants, glycolysis is the <strong>key metabolic component of the respiratory  process,</strong> which generates energy in the form of ATP in cells where  photosynthesis is not taking place.  </li>
				  <li>Many  types of <strong>anaerobic microorganisms</strong> are entirely dependent on glycolysis.  </li>
				  <li>Mammalian  tissues such as renal medulla and brain solely dependent on glycolysis for  major sources of metabolic energy.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>The tricarboxylic acid cycle </strong> </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>In  1937, Sir Hans Krebs, an English biochemist proposed a pathway consisting of a  cycle of reactions through which acetyl CoA is converted to carbon dioxide and  water and hence the cycle was named as Kreb's cycle.</li>
				  <li> All the enzymes catalyzing the reactions of  this cycle occur inside <strong>mitochondria  (mitochondrial matrix</strong>) in contrast with those of glycolysis, which occur in  the cytosol.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>                        Before pyruvate can  enter the citric acid cycle, it must be oxidatively decarboxylated to acetyl  CoA (active acetate).  <br />
				  Three  different enzymes working sequentially in a multienzyme complex catalyse this  reaction.  <br />
				  This  formation of acetyl CoA from pyruvate <strong>by  alpha-oxidative decarboxylation</strong> occurs in the mitochondrion following the  formation of pyruvate in the cytosol during glycolysis.  <br />
				  The  reaction involves six cofactors: <strong>coenzyme  A, NAD+,  lipoic acid, FAD, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) and Mg2+.</strong><br />

                    <strong>Reactions of the TCA cycle</strong><br />
				  <strong>Acetyl  CoA,</strong> derived mainly from the oxidation of carbohydrates, lipids and  proteins, combines with oxaloacetate to form <strong>citrate</strong> which is the first reaction of the citric acid cycle.  Subsequently, citrate is oxidised in a series  of reactions   liberating carbon dioxide  and reducing equivalents (NADH, FADH2).  <br />
				  The  oxaloacetate is regenerated and functions therefore in a catalytic manner in  the oxidation of acetyl CoA to two molecules of carbon dioxide.<br />
  <strong>The citric acid cycle has  eight steps as described below:</strong><br />
  <strong>i.  Formation of citrate</strong><br />
				  The first step is the reaction between the  four-carbon unit, oxaloacetate and the two-carbon unit, acetyl CoA resulting in  the formation of citrate and coenzyme A catalysed <strong>by citrate synthase</strong>.  The  coenzyme A formed in this reaction is recycled.<br />
  <strong>ii.  Formation of isocitrate via cis-aconitate</strong><br />
				  The isomerization of citrate to  isocitrate catalysed by <strong>aconitase</strong> occurs in two steps with the formation of cis-aconitate as an  intermediate.  This formation of  isocitrate involves both dehydration and hydration.  The result is an interchange of hydrogen and  a hydroxyl group.  In this reaction, <strong>fluoroacetate </strong>acts as an inhibitor to  the enzyme, aconitase.<br />
  <strong>iii.  Oxidation of isocitrate to </strong><strong>-ketoglutarate</strong><br />
				  The enzyme, <strong>isocitrate dehydrogenase</strong> oxidatively decarboxylates isocitrate to -ketoglutarate  with simultaneous liberation of carbon dioxide.   The intermediate in this reaction is oxalosuccinate, an unstable -ketoacid.  While bound to the enzyme, it loses carbon  dioxide to form -ketoglutarate.  There are two different forms of isocitrate  dehydrogenase (isozymes), one requiring NAD+  and other requiring NADP+.<br />
  <strong>iv.  Oxidation of </strong><strong>-ketoglutarate  to succinyl CoA</strong><br />
				  -Ketoglutarate,  undergoes oxidative decarboxylation forming succinyl-CoA and carbon dioxide in  the presence of <strong>-ketoglutarate  dehydrogenase complex,</strong> an assembly consisting of  three kinds of enzymes.  The mechanism of  this reaction is very similar to the reaction catalyzed by <strong>pyruvate dehydrogenase complex</strong>.   This reaction is irreversible. <strong>Arsenite </strong>acts as an inhibitor of  TCA cycle by  inhibiting the action of  -ketoglutarate  dehydrogenase complex.<br />
  <strong>v.  Conversion of succinyl CoA to succinate</strong><br />
				  Succinate is formed in a reversible  reaction from succinyl CoA catalysed by the enzyme, <strong>succinyl CoA synthetase or succinate thiokinase</strong> with the  simultaneous formation of GTP and coenzyme A. Succinate thiokinase utilises GDP  in animal tissues whereas it uses ADP predominantly in plants and  bacteria.  The <strong>formation of GTP</strong> in this reaction is a <strong>substrate level phosphorylation reaction.</strong></p>
				<strong><br clear="all" />
                </strong>
                <p><strong>vi.  Formation of fumarate by oxidation of  succinate</strong><br />
                  The succinate formed from succinyl  CoA is oxidised to fumarate by <strong>succinate  dehydrogenase </strong>with the participation of FAD.  <strong>Malonate,</strong> an analogue of succinate being a strong competitive inhibitor of succinate  dehydrogenase, blocks the citric acid cycle.<br />
  <strong>vii.  Formation of malate by hydration of fumarate</strong><br />
                  The reversible hydration of fumarate  to L-malate is catalysed by <strong>fumarase. </strong><br />
  <strong>viii.  Oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate</strong><br />
                  This reaction forms the last  reaction of the citric acid cycle. NAD-linked malate dehydrogenase catalyses  the oxidation of  L-malate to  oxaloacetate.<br />
  <strong>Energetics of tricarboxylic  acid cycle</strong><br />
                  From one molecule of glucose, two  molecules of pyruvate  are formed which  in turn give  rise to two molecules of  acetyl CoA.  When two molecules of  acetyl-CoA undergo oxidation through TCA cycle,   the following number of high-energy bonds (ATPs) are produced.<br />
  <strong>Significance of the TCA  cycle</strong><br />
                  i)  The major significance of the citric acid  cycle is to act as the <strong>final common  pathway for the oxidation of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins, </strong>since  glucose, fatty acids and many amino acids are all metabolised to acetyl CoA. <br />
                  ii)  This cycle serves as the mechanism by which  much of <strong>the free energy liberated during  the oxidation of carbohydrate, lipids and amino acids is made available.</strong><br />
                  iii)  TCA cycle is of further significance since it  has <strong>dual or amphibolic role thus  providing precursor compounds for biosynthesis of other biomolecules</strong> (amino  acids, fatty acids, and glucose.<br />
  <strong>Glyoxylate cycle</strong> </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Plants,  especially seedlings, can use acetate as the only source of carbon for all  carbon compounds they produce. </li>
                  <li> Acetyl CoA, which enters the TCA cycle, is  completely oxidised to two molecules of CO2.   Thus it would not be possible for the cycle to produce the massive  amounts biosynthetic precursors needed for acetate based growth unless  alternative reactions were possible.  </li>
                  <li>Plants  and bacteria employ a <strong>modification of  the TCA cycle</strong> called the glyoxylate cycle to produce four <strong>carbon dicarboxylic acids  from acetyl CoA</strong>.  The glyoxylate cycle bypasses the  decarboxylations of the TCA cycle.</li>
                  <li>The  enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle in plants are present in <strong>glyoxysomes.</strong>  <strong>Isocitrate lyase and malate synthase</strong> are  the additional enzymes required for this cycle in addition to TCA cycle  enzymes.  </li>
                  <li>Glyoxysomes  do not contain all the enzymes needed for the glyoxylate cycle.  The enzymes succinate dehydrogenase, fumarase  and malate dehydrogenase are absent. </li>
                  <li> Hence glyoxysomes, with the help of  mitochondria run their cycle Succinate molecules formed in glyoxysomes are  transported to mitochondria where it is converted to oxaloacetate with the help  of TCA cycle enzymes.  The oxaloacetate  is then converted to asparate and transported to glyoxysomes  where it is   transaminated to oxaloacetate.  </li>
                  <li>The  oxaloacetate is converted to malate through glyoxylate cycle.  The malate then enters the cytosol and  converted into glucose via gluconeogenesis pathway.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>      The existence of glyoxylate cycle is  important for the <strong>germinating seeds</strong> where photosynthesis is not possible.   Triacylglycerols rich in oilseeds are degraded to acetyl CoA.  Glyoxysomes formed during germination convert  the acetyl CoA to oxaloacetate, which is then utilised for the conversion to  glucose through gluconeogenesis.  Once  the  growing seedling begins their  photosynthesis to produce carbohydrates, the glyoxysomes disappear.<br />
                    <strong>Electron transport chain and  oxidative phosphorylation</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The  mitochondrion is the aerobic organelle in which the final stage of the  oxidation of food occurs. </li>
                  <li> It is the site of the citric acid cycle, fatty  acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation, processes that are responsible  for the formation of  ATP under aerobic  condition.  </li>
                  <li>The  two most important energy transductions in the biological systems are the <strong>oxidative phosphorylation (ATP synthesis  driven by electron transfer</strong> to oxygen) and photophosphorylation (ATP  synthesis driven by light).</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>Oxidative  phosphorylation is the process in which ATP molecules are formed as a result of  the transfer of electrons from the reducing equivalents, NADH or FADH2 (produced by glycolysis, the citric acid  cycle  and fatty acid oxidation) to  oxygen by a series of electron carriers in the form of a chain located in the  inner membrane of mitochondria. This is the final reaction sequence of  respiration. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>Since  the electrons are transferred by a series of electron carriers in the form of a  chain, it is known as electron transport chain (ETC).  </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>In  plants, ATP is mainly derived through photosynthesis  utilizing the energy derived from the  sun.  In non-photosynthetic tissues, ATPs  are derived through respiration. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>            The electrons  are transferred along a set of cytochromes in  the form of a chain in steps from the <strong>more  electronegative components (NADH/FADH2) to the more electropositive oxygen.</strong><br />
                  The respiratory chain consists of a  number of protein complexes that are remarkably complicated in nature.  They are known as <strong>NADH- ubiquinone reductase, succinate</strong>-ubiquinone reductase,  ubiquinone-cytochrome  c reductase and  cytochrome  c oxidase These complexes are  also called as <strong>NADH dehydrogenase,  succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome   b-c  complex and cytochrome  c oxidase   respectively or as complexes I - IV.  </strong><br />
                  All the three reductases are also  known as  iron-sulphur proteins since  they contain Fe-S centres as their critical components. Iron in these enzyme  complexes can exist in two forms as Fe2+ and Fe3+.   Each cytochrome in its oxidised form (Fe3+) accepts one electron and becomes  reduced to Fe2+ form.   Fe2+ donates electron to the next carrier. </p>
                <h2>    Oxidation of one molecule of NADH results in generation of 2.5  molecules of ATP whereas oxidation of one  molecule of FADH2 generates 1.5   molecules of ATP.  </h2>
                <p><strong>Sites of ATP formation</strong><br />
                  When  electrons are transported along the respiratory chain, due to high amount of  energy released, ATP molecules are synthesised at the following three sites.   <br />
                  i<strong>)     transfer of electrons from NADH to  ubiquinone via flavoprotein (FMN).</strong><br />
  <strong>                ii)     transfer of electrons from cyt b to cyt c.</strong><br />
  <strong>               iii)     transfer of electrons from cyt a to cyt a3.</strong><br />
  <strong>Mechanism of ATP formation</strong><br />
                  Two principal hypotheses have been  proposed for the mechanism of oxidative phosphorylation.<br />
                  i<strong>.  Chemical hypothesis</strong><br />
  <strong>                        ii.   Chemiosmotic theory</strong><br />
  <strong>Chemical hypothesis</strong><br />
                  Many   attempts have been made since 1920 to identify an energy-rich metabolite  linking oxidation and phosphorylation.   No such intermediates was isolated and in 1960, Peter Mitchell suggested  that no possibility of existence of such an intermediate compound.  So, the chemical hypothesis has become  discredited.<br />
                  Chemiosmotic  theory</p>
                <p>            The  chemiosmotic theory states that the coupling of oxidation to phosphorylation is  indirect.  According to this, the  hydrogen ions (protons) generated by the oxidation of components in the  respiratory chain are ejected to the outside (matrix) of the inner  membrane.  The electrochemical potential  difference resulting from the asymmetric distribution of the hydrogen ions  (protons or H+)  is used to drive a membrane-located ATP synthase which in the presence of Pi +  ADP forms ATP.<br />
                  Inhibitors  of respiratory chain<br />
                  Inhibitors,  which inhibit respiratory chain, may be grouped as follows:<br />
                  i<strong>.  Inhibitors of electron  transfer</strong><br />
  <strong>            ii. Inhibitors of ATP synthase</strong><br />
  <strong>            iii.  Uncouplers of  oxidative phosphorylation</strong><br />
                  Inhibitors  that arrest respiration by blocking the respiratory chain act at three sites.<br />
                  Compounds such as barbiturates,  amytal, rotenone prevent the transfer of electron  from FeS centre to ubiquinone. Carboxin  specifically inhibits transfer of reducing equivalents from succinate  dehydrogenase to ubiquinone. <br />
                  Antimycin A blocks electron transfer  from cytochrome b to cytochrome  c1.          Substances such as cyanide (CN-), azide (N3-) and carbon  monoxide inhibit cytochrome  c oxidase by  binding to heme group and are extremely poisonous. Oligomycin inhibits ATP  synthase.                    <br />
                  In the presence of the uncouplers  such as dicoumarol and 2,4-dinitrophenol, oxidation proceeds without  phosphorylation (dissociation of oxidation in the respiratory chain from  phosphorylation) releasing energy in the form of heat rather than in the form  of ATP.<br />
  <strong>The  hexose monophosphate shunt  </strong><br />
                  The hexose monophosphate shunt (HMP shunt), also called as pentose  phosphate pathway (PPP) and   phosphogluconate pathway  is an  alternate pathway for the oxidation of glucose.   In 1930, Otto Warburg discovered the first evidence for the existence of  this pathway, which was later, elucidated in 1950 by Frank Dickens group.  <br />
                  The pathway is important during the  hours of darkness and in non-photosynthetic tissues such as differentiating  tissues and germinating seeds. In animal system,  it occurs in certain tissues, notably liver,  lactating mammary gland and adipose tissue in addition to the Embden - Meyerhof  pathway.   The enzymes of the shunt  pathway are found in the extra mitochondrial soluble portion of the cell.  It is in effect, a multicyclic process  whereby three molecules of glucose 6-phosphate give rise to three molecules of  CO2 and three 5-carbon residues.  The latter are rearranged to regenerate two  molecules of glucose 6-phosphate and one molecule of  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.  Since two  molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate can regenerate a molecule of glucose  6-phosphate by reactions, which are essentially a reversal of glycolysis, the  pathway can account for the complete oxidation of glucose.  Here oxidation is achieved by dehydrogenation  using NADP and not NAD as in Embden-Meyerhof's glycolytic pathway. This pathway  consists of a series of reactions taking place in three stages <br />
  <strong>Stage I. Formation of NADPH  and ribulose  5-phosphate</strong><br />
                  The  first three reactions of the pathway, catalysed by glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase, phosphogluconolactonase and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase  ultimately result in <strong>the formation of ribulose 5-phosphate and NADPH.</strong><br />
  <strong>Stage II.  </strong><br />
                  In this stage, the ribulose  5-phosphate is converted to ribose 5-phosphate by ribulose 5-phosphate  isomerase and then to xylulose-5 phosphate by ribulose 5-phosphate  epimerase.  The ribose 5-phosphate is  essential precursor in the biosynthesis of nucleotides. <br />
  <strong>Stage III.</strong><br />
                  In the third stage, three molecules  of the 5-carbon sugars are converted to two molecules of 6-carbon sugars and  one molecule of 3-carbon sugar, glyceraldehyde 3- phosphate  catalysed<strong> by two enzymes, transaldolase and transketolase. </strong><br />
  <strong>            Transketolase</strong> catalyses the transfer of a C2 unit from  xylulose 5-phosphate to ribose 5-phosphate yielding glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate  and sedoheptulose 7-phosphate.<br />
                  <strong>Transaldolase</strong> catalyses the transfer of a three carbon unit from sedoheptulose 7-phosphate to  glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate yielding erythrose 4-phosphate and fructose  6-phosphate.<br />
  <strong>Control of the  HMP shunt</strong><br />
                  Ribose 5-phosphate and NADPH are the  principal products of the HMP shunt.  In  this pathway, excess amount of ribose 5-phosphate is converted into glycolytic  intermediates when the need for NADPH exceeds that of ribose 5-phosphate in  nucleotide biosynthesis.   <br />
                  If ribose 5-phosphate is needed more  than NADPH, fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate are used for  the synthesis of ribose 5-phosphate by reversal of the transaldolase and  transketolase reactions.<br />
                  The rate of NADPH formation in the  pathway is controlled by the rate of the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase  reaction.<br />
  <strong>Metabolic significance  of  the HMP Shunt</strong><br />
                  i.Major  function of HMP shunt appears to be the production of reduced NADP (NADPH)  required by anabolic (synthetic) processes such as fatty acid synthesis outside  the mitochondria .<br />
                  ii.The  pathway provides  ribose  for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis. <br />
                  iii.It  also provides  erythrose required for the  synthesis of phenolics and other aromatic compounds through shikimate pathway.<br />
                  Glucose 6-phosphate can be used  as a substrate either for glycolysis or for  the pentose phosphate pathway.  On the  basis of the cell's needs, it makes this choice for biosynthesis and for energy  from catabolism.  If glucose 6-phosphate  is channeled into glycolysis, ATP is produced in abundance; but if it is  channeled into pentose phosphate pathway.   NADPH and ribose 5-phosphate are produced.  The fate of glucose 6-phosphate is determined  to a large extent of phosphofructokinase and glucose-6 P.  There are four principal possibilities in  which, depending upon the cell's  need,  HMP shunt operates.<br />
                  i.  More ribose 5-phosphate than NADPH  is required<br />
                  Most of the glucose 6-phosphate is  converted into fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by the  glycolytic pathway.  Two molecules of  fructose 6-phosphate and one molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate are  converted into three molecules of ribose 5-phosphate by a reversal of reactions  catalysed by transaldolase and transketolase reactions.<br />
                  ii..  <strong>Both  ribose 5-phosphate and NADPH are needed by the cell</strong><br />
                  In this, the first four reactions of  the pentose phosphate pathway predominate.   Ribose 5-phosphate is the principal product of the metabolism and NADPH  is also produced.  The net reaction for  these processes is </p>
                <div><br />
                    <strong>Glucose 6  P + 2 NADP+ + H2O  --------</strong><strong> Ribose 5-Phosphate + CO2 + 2 NADPH + H+</strong> </div>
                <p><strong>3.  More NADPH than ribose 5-phosphate is needed  by the cell</strong><br />
                  Under this situation, glucose  6-phosphate is completely oxidized to carbon dioxide.  Three reactions are active.  First, two NADPH and one ribose 5-phosphate  are formed by the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway.  Then, ribose 5-phosphate is converted into  fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by transketolase and  transaldolase.  In the final reaction,  glucose 6-phosphate is resynthesised from fructose 6-phosphate and  glyceraldehyde  3-phosphate by the  gluconeogenic pathway.  The sum of these  reactions is <br />
                  Glucose  6-phosphate + 12 NADPH+ + 7H2O  -------  6 CO2 + 12 NADPH + 12H+ + Pi<strong></strong><br />
  <strong>iv.   Both   NADPH and ATP are needed by the cell.</strong><br />
                  In this, fructose 6-phosphate and  glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate derived from ribose 5-phosphate enter the glycolytic  pathway and form pyruvate.  ATP and NADPH  are concomitantly generated and five of the six carbons of glucose 6-phosphate  emerge in pyruvate.</p>
                <div><br />
                    <strong>3 Glucose  6-phosphate + 6 NADP+ + 5NAD+ + 5 Pi +  10ADP ------</strong><strong> 5 pyruvate + 3 CO2   + 6NADPH + 5NADH + 10ATP + 2H2O + 10H+</strong> </div>
                <p><strong>Comparative account of  glycolysis and HMP shunt</strong><br />
                  These two major pathways are meant for the  catabolism of glucose.  They have little  in common, e.g. the presence of metabolites like glucose 6-phosphate.  The major differences are<br />
                  i.  ATP is not generated in the HMP pathway,  whereas in glycolysis, ATP molecules <br />
                  are generated.<br />
                  ii.  Pentose phosphates  are   generated in the  HMP  pathway but not in glycolysis.</p>
                iii. NADH is produced in glycolytic pathway  whereas NADPH is produced in HMP  shunt.
