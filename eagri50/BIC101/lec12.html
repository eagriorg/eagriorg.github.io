				<p><strong>Classification of protein</strong><br />
Proteins are classified based on their</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Solubility  and composition</li>
				  <li> Function</li>
				  <li>Shape  &amp; size</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>A.  Classification based on solubility and composition</strong><br />
				  According  to this classification, proteins are divided into three main groups as <strong>simple, conjugated and derived proteins</strong>.<br />
  <strong>(i)  Simple proteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Simple  proteins yield on hydrolysis, <strong>only amino  acids. </strong></li>
				  <li>These  proteins are further classified based on their solubility in different solvents  as well as their heat coagulability.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Albumins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Albumins  are readily soluble in water, dilute acids and alkalies </li>
				  <li> coagulated by heat. </li>
				  <li>Seed  proteins contain albumin in lesser quantities. </li>
				  <li>Albumins  may be precipitated out from solution using high salt concentration, a process  called <strong>'salting out'</strong>. </li>
				  <li>They  are deficient in <strong>glycine.</strong> </li>
				  <li>Serum  albumin and ovalbumin (egg white) are examples.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Globulins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Globulins  are <strong>insoluble or sparingly soluble in  water</strong>, but their solubility is greatly increased by the addition of neutral  salts such as sodium chloride. <br />
				    These proteins are coagulated by heat. </li>
				  <li>They  are deficient in <strong>methionine</strong>. </li>
				  <li>Serum  globulin, fibrinogen, myosin of muscle and globulins of pulses are examples.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Prolamins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Prolamins  are insoluble in water but soluble in 70-80% aqueous alcohol. </li>
				  <li>Upon  hydrolysis they yield much proline and amide nitrogen, hence the name prolamin. </li>
				  <li>They  are deficient in <strong>lysine</strong>. </li>
				  <li>Gliadin  of wheat and zein of corn are examples of prolamins.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Glutelins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Glutelins  are <strong>insoluble in water</strong> and <strong>absolute alcohol but soluble in dilute  alkalies and  acids.</strong></li>
				  <li>They  are <strong>plant proteins</strong> e.g., glutenin of  wheat.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Histones</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Histones  are small and stable basic proteins </li>
				  <li>They  contain fairly large amounts of basic amino acid, <strong>histidine</strong>. </li>
				  <li>They  are soluble in water, but insoluble in ammonium hydroxide. </li>
				  <li>They  are not readily coagulated by heat. </li>
				  <li>They  occur in <strong>globin of hemoglobin and  nucleoproteins</strong>.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Protamines</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Protamines  are the simplest of the proteins. </li>
				  <li>They  are <strong>soluble in water and are not  coagulated by heat</strong>. </li>
				  <li>They  are basic in nature due to the presence of large quantities of <strong>arginine.</strong></li>
				  <li> Protamines are found in association with  nucleic acid in the sperm cells of certain fish. </li>
				  <li><strong>Tyrosine and tryptophan </strong>are  usually absent in protamines.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Albuminoids</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>These  are <strong>characterized by great stability and  insolubility in water and salt solutions.</strong></li>
			
				  <li>These  are called albuminoids because they are essentially similar to albumin and  globulins. </li>
				  <li>They  are highly resistant to proteolytic enzymes. </li>
				  <li>They  are fibrous in nature and form most of the supporting structures of animals.</li>
				  <li> They occur as chief constituent of exoskeleton  structure such as hair, horn and nails.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>ii.  Conjugated or compound proteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>These  are <strong>simple proteins combined with some  non-protein substances known as prosthetic groups. </strong></li>
				  <li>The  nature of the non-protein or prosthetic groups is the basis for the sub  classification of conjugated proteins.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Nucleoproteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Nucleoproteins  are simple basic proteins (protamines or histones) in salt combination with  nucleic acids as the prosthetic group. </li>
				  <li>They  are the important constituents of nuclei and chromatin.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Mucoproteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>These  proteins are composed of <strong>simple proteins  in combination with carbohydrates </strong>like <strong>mucopolysaccharides</strong>,  which include <strong>hyaluronic acid and  chondroitin sulphates. </strong></li>
				  <li>On  hydrolysis, mucopolysaccharides yield more than 4% of amino-sugars, hexosamine  and uronic acid e.g., <strong>ovomucoid</strong> from  egg white. </li>
				  <li>Soluble  mucoproteins are neither readily denatured by heat nor easily precipitated by  common protein precipitants like trichloroacetic acid or picric acid. </li>
				  <li>The  term <strong>glycoproteins</strong> is restricted to  those proteins that contain small amounts of carbohydrate usually less than 4%  hexosamine.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Chromoproteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>These  are proteins containing <strong>coloured  prosthetic groups</strong> e.g., haemoglobin, flavoprotein and cytochrome.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Lipoproteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>These  are proteins conjugated with <strong>lipids such  as neutral fat, phospholipids and cholesterol </strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Metalloproteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>These  are <strong>metal-binding proteins</strong>. </li>
				  <li>A  -globulin, termed <strong>transferrin</strong> is  capable of combining with <strong>iron, copper  and zinc. </strong></li>
				  <li>This  protein constitutes 3% of the total plasma protein. </li>
				  <li>Another  example is <strong>ceruloplasmin</strong>, which  contains <strong>copper.</strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Phosphoproteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>These  are proteins containing <strong>phosphoric acid</strong>. </li>
				  <li>Phosphoric  acid is linked to the hydroxyl group of certain amino acids like serine in the  protein e.g., casein of milk.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>iii.  Derived proteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>These  are proteins derived by partial to complete hydrolysis from the simple or  conjugated proteins by the action of acids, alkalies or enzymes. </li>
				  <li>They  include two types of derivatives, <strong>primary-derived  proteins and secondary-derived proteins.</strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Primary-derived  proteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>These  protein derivatives are formed by processes causing only slight changes in the  protein molecule and its properties. </li>
				  <li>There  is little or no hydrolytic cleavage of peptide bonds.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Proteans</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Proteans  are insoluble products formed by the action of water, dilute acids and enzymes. </li>
				  <li>These  are particularly formed from globulins but are insoluble in dilute salt  solutions </li>
				  <li>e.g., <strong>myosan from myosin, fibrin from  fibrinogen</strong>.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Metaproteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>These  are formed by the action of acids and alkalies upon protein. </li>
				  <li>They  are insoluble in neutral solvents.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Coagulated  proteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Coagulated  proteins are insoluble products formed by the action of heat or alcohol  on natural proteins</li>
				  <li>e.g.,  cooked meat and cooked albumin.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Secondary-derived  proteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>These  proteins are formed in the progressive hydrolytic cleavage of the peptide bonds  of protein molecule. </li>
				  <li>They  are roughly grouped into <strong>proteoses,  peptones and peptides according to average molecular weight. </strong></li>
				  <li>Proteoses  are hydrolytic products of proteins, which are soluble in water and are not  coagulated by heat. </li>
				  <li>Peptones  are hydrolytic products, which have simpler structure than proteoses.</li>
				  <li> They are soluble in water and are not  coagulated by heat. </li>
				  <li>Peptides  are composed of relatively few amino acids. </li>
				  <li>They  are water-soluble and not coagulated by heat. </li>
				  <li>The  complete hydrolytic decomposition of the natural protein molecule into amino acids  generally progresses through successive stages as follows:</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Protein  -----&gt; Protean -------Metaprotein <br />
				  Proteoses  ------&gt;Peptones -------&gt;Peptides ------amino acids<br />
  <strong>b.  Classification of proteins based on function</strong><br />
				  Proteins are classified based on their  functions as:<br />
  <strong>Catalytic  proteins – Enzymes</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The  most striking characteristic feature of these proteins is their ability to <strong>function   within the living cells as biocatalysts. </strong></li>
				  <li>These <strong>biocatalysts</strong> are called as enzymes. </li>
				  <li>Enzymes  represent the largest class. </li>
				  <li>Nearly  2000 different kinds of enzymes are known, each catalyzing a different kind of  reaction. </li>
				  <li>They <strong>enhance the reaction rates </strong>a million  fold.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Regulatory  proteins - Hormones</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>These  are polypeptides and small proteins found in relatively lower concentrations in  animal kingdom but <strong>play highly important  regulatory role in maintaining order in complex metabolic reactions</strong> </li>
				  <li>e.g.,  growth hormone, insulin etc.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Protective  proteins - Antibodies</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>These  proteins have <strong>protective defense  function</strong>. </li>
				  <li>These  proteins combine with foreign protein and other substances and fight against  certain diseases.</li>
				  <li> e.g., immunoglobulin. </li>
				  <li>These  proteins are produced in the spleen and lymphatic cells in response to foreign  substances called antigen. </li>
				  <li>The  newly formed protein is called <strong>antibody</strong> which specifically combines with the antigen which triggered its synthesis  thereby prevents the development of diseases.</li>
				  <li> <strong>Fibrin </strong>present  in the<strong> blood</strong> is also a protective  protein.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Storage  proteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>It  is a major class of proteins which has the function of <strong>storing amino acids as nutrients and as building blocks for the growing  embryo</strong>. </li>
				  <li>Storage  proteins are <strong>source of essential amino  acids</strong>, which cannot be synthesized by human beings. </li>
				  <li>The  major storage protein in pulses is <strong>globulins  and prolamins in cereals. </strong></li>
				  <li>In  rice the major storage protein is glutelins. </li>
				  <li>Albumin  of egg and casein of milk are also storage proteins.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Transport  proteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Some  proteins are capable of binding and transporting specific types of molecules  through blood. </li>
				  <li><strong>Haemoglobin</strong> is a conjugated protein composed of colourless basic protein, the <strong>globin </strong>and  <strong>ferroprotoporphyrin  or haem</strong>. </li>
				  <li>It  has the capacity to bind with oxygen and transport through blood to various  tissues. </li>
				  <li><strong>Myoglobin,</strong> a related protein, transports oxygen in muscle. </li>
				  <li><strong>Lipids</strong> bind to serum proteins like albumin and transported as lipoproteins in the  blood.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Toxic  proteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Some  of the proteins are toxic in nature.</li>
				  <li> <strong>Ricin</strong> present in <strong>castor bean</strong> is extremely  toxic to higher animals in very small amounts. </li>
				  <li><strong>Enzyme inhibitors such as  trypsin inhibitor</strong> bind to digestive enzyme  and prevent the availability of the protein.</li>
				  <li><strong>Lectin</strong>,  a toxic protein present in legumes, <strong>agglutinates  red blood cells</strong>.</li>
				  <li>A  bacterial toxin causes cholera, which is a protein. </li>
				  <li><strong>Snake venom</strong> is protein in nature.<strong></strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Structural  proteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>These  proteins serve as <strong>structural materials  or as important components of extra cellular fluid. </strong></li>
				  <li>Examples  of structural proteins are <strong>myosin of  muscles, keratin of skin and hair and collagen of connective tissue. </strong></li>
				  <li>Carbohydrates,  fats, minerals and other cellular components are organized around such  structural proteins that form the molecular framework of living material.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Contractile  proteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Proteins  like <strong>actin and myosin</strong> function as  essential elements in contractile system of skeletal muscle.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Secretary  proteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Fibroin</strong> is a protein secreted by spiders and silkworms to form webs and cocoons.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Exotic  proteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Antarctic  fishes live in -1.9oC waters, well below the temperature at which their blood  is expected to freeze. </li>
				  <li>These  fishes are prevented from freezing by <strong>antifreeze  glycoproteins</strong> present in their body.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>C.  Classification based on size and shape</strong><br />
				  Based  on size and shape, the proteins are also subdivided into <strong>globular and fibrous proteins.</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Globular proteins</strong> are mostly water-soluble and fragile in nature e.g., <strong>enzymes, hormones and antibodies. </strong></li>
				  <li><strong>Fibrous proteins</strong> are tough and water-insoluble. </li>
				  <li>They  are used to build a variety of materials that support and protect specific  tissues, e.g., skin, hair, fingernails and keratin</li>
