				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Fatty       acids are <strong>carboxylic acids</strong> with       hydrocarbon chains of 2 to 36 carbons.</li>
				  <li>More       than 200 fatty acids have been isolated from higher and lower plants. </li>
				  <li>Of       these, only a few are present in large quantities in most plant lipids.       These are referred as <strong>major fatty       acids</strong>.</li>
				  <li> Fatty acids present in smaller       proportions are called as <strong>minor       fatty acids.</strong> </li>
				  <li>Major       and minor fatty acids are usually biosynthesised by analogous pathways. </li>
				  <li>Fatty       acids that occur only in a few plant species are called as <strong>unusual fatty acids.</strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Major fatty acids</strong></p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>The       major fatty acids are <strong>saturated or       unsaturated</strong> with an unbranched carbon chain. </li>
				  <li>The       saturated fatty acids are <strong>lauric       (dodecanoic), myristic (tetradecanoic), palmitic (hexadecanoic) and       stearic (octadecanoic) acid</strong></li>
				  <li>The <strong>unsaturated fatty acids</strong> <strong>are oleic (9-octadecenoic), linoleic       (9,12-octadecadienoic) and -linolenic (9,12,15- octadecatrienoic) acid. </strong></li>
				  <li>They       are usually found in the lipids from all parts of plants </li>
				  <li>The       structure of fatty acids are written as a symbol of two numbers separated       by a colon: the first number denotes the carbon atoms in the chain and the       second number denotes the number of unsaturation centres. </li>
				  <li>The       positions of double bonds are specified by superscript numbers following       (delta). </li>
				  <li>Thus       18:2 (9,       12) indicates an eighteen carbon fatty acid with two double bonds       between C-9 and C-10, and between C-12 and C-13. </li>
				  <li>The       double bonds of all naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids are in <strong>the cis configuration</strong>. </li>
				  <li> The non-polar hydrocarbon chain accounts       for the poor solubility of fatty acids in water.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Minor fatty acids</strong><br />
				  The  fatty acid composition of cow's and goat's milk are characterised by a high  content of short and medium chain saturated fatty acids.<br />

				<p><strong>Unusual  fatty acids</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The  unusual fatty acids are found only in few individual species or genus or a  whole family.</li>
				  <li> Castor bean (Ricinus communis) seed oil is rich in <strong>ricinoleic acid (</strong>90%) which is 12-hydroxy oleic acid CH3(CH2)5-CH(OH)-CH2-CH=CH-(CH2)7-COOH.</li>
				  <li>Rape  seed (Brassica napus) is rich  in <strong>erucic acid</strong> (cis-13-docosenoic  acid CH3(CH2)7-CH=CH-(CH2)11-COOH). </li>
				  <li><strong>Hydnocarpic and chaulmoogric  acids</strong> are found in chaulmoogra oil which is used  in the treatment of leprosy.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Essential  fatty acids</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Human  body is unable to synthesise all fatty acids found in the body. </li>
				  <li>Those  fatty acids that <strong>are not synthesised in  the body</strong> but required for normal body growth and maintenance are called as <strong>essential fatty acids</strong>. </li>
				  <li>These  fatty acids are to be supplied through diet. </li>
				  <li><strong>Linoleic and linolenic acids</strong> are essential fatty acids  </li>
				  <li>The  longer chain fatty acids can be synthesised by the body from dietary linoleic  and -linolenic acids. </li>
				  <li><strong>Arachidonic acid</strong> is essential but it can be synthesised by the body from linolenic acid. It is  also present in the meat</li>
				  <li>Linoleic  acid is grouped under <strong>n-6 family</strong> because the 6th carbon from methyl end possesses the double bond. </li>
				  <li>Other  fatty acids that are synthesised in the body from linoleic acid such as linolenic and  arachidonic acids also belong to n-6 family.</li>
				  <li> <strong>-Linolenic acid</strong> belongs to n-3 family and is an essential fatty acid. </li>
				  <li>The  third carbon from the methyl end possess the double bond </li>
				  <li>The  organs and tissues that perform the more routine and generalized functions such  as adipose tissue, liver, muscle, kidney and the reproductive organs tend to  have membranes in which n-6 family of polyunsaturated fatty acids predominate. </li>
				  <li>Nervous  tissue and retina of the eye have a larger proportion of the longer chain acids  with 5 or 6 double bonds predominantly of the n-3 family.</li>
				  <li> Fish oils and spirulina are rich in fatty  acids of n-3 family.</li>
				  <li><strong>Arachidonic acid</strong> serves as precursor for the <strong>synthesis of  prostaglandins,thrombaxanes and prostacyclins. </strong></li>
				  <li>These  fatty acid derivatives are called as 'eicosanoid' meaning 20 C compounds.</li>
				  <li> The main source of these eicosanoids are the <strong>membrane phospholipids</strong> from which they  are released by the action of phospholipase-A.</li>
				  <li><strong>Phosphatidyl inositol</strong> which contains a high concentration of arachidonic acid in carbon-2 of glycerol  provides a major store of eicosanoid precursors.</li>
				  <li>Phosphatidyl  inositol is an important constituent of cell membrane phospholipids; upon  stimulation by a suitable animal hormone it is cleaved into diacylglycerol and  inositol phosphate, both of which act as <strong>internal  signals or second messengers</strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Simple  lipids</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Lipids  containing <strong>only fatty acids and glycerol  or long chain alcohols</strong> (monohydric) are called as <strong>simple lipids</strong> which include <strong>fats,  oils and waxes</strong>.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Fats  and oils</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Triacylglycerols  are the simplest lipids constructed from fatty acids and glycerol.</li>
				  <li>They  are also referred as triglycerides, fats or neutral fats. </li>
				  <li>Triacylglycerols  are composed of <strong>three fatty acids  esterified to the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol</strong> </li>
				  <li>When  all the 3 fatty acid molecules are of the same kind the triacylglycerol is said  to be <strong>simple triacylglycerol.</strong> </li>
				  <li><strong>Mixed triacylglycerol</strong> possesses two or more different fatty acids. </li>
				  <li>Triacylglycerol  that are solid at room temperature are called as <strong>fats</strong></li>
				  <li> Liquid triacylglycerols are called as oils.</li>
				  <li>Neutral  fats or oils are mostly composed of mixed triacyl glycerol. </li>
				  <li>Fats  are usually <strong>rich in saturated fatty  acids</strong> and the unsaturated fatty acids predominate in oils.</li>
				  <li> Most oil-producing plants store their lipids  in the form of triacylglycerols.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Storage fats or oils</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Triacylglycerols  are widely distributed in the plant kingdom. They are found both in vegetative  as well as reproductive tissues. </li>
				  <li>Triacylglycerols  are normally stored in the <strong>endosperm of  the seed</strong> although some plants store appreciable quantities of fat in the <strong>fleshy fruit mesocarp</strong>, for example,  avocado. </li>
				  <li>Some  plants like the <strong>oil palm</strong>, store oils  in both the <strong>mesocarp (Palm oil)</strong> and  the <strong>endosperm (Palm kernel oil).</strong></li>
				  <li>The  oil present <strong>as droplets</strong> in the  cytoplasm of the <strong>seed cells.</strong> </li>
				  <li>These  droplets are called as <strong>oil bodies</strong> and are surrounded by a membrane composed of phospholipids and protein. </li>
				  <li>Most  of the common edible oils (groundnut, sunflower, gingelly, soybean, safflower,  rice bran) contain limited number of the common fatty acids such as palmitic,  stearic, oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids. </li>
				  <li>Palm  kernel and coconut oils contain higher amount of medium chain saturated fatty  acids.</li>
				  <li> Seed oils contain small amount of  phospholipids, carotenoids, tocopherols, tocotrienols and plant sterols  depending on the species of plant and degree of processing.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Structural  or hidden fats in plants</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The  leaves of higher plants contain upto 7% of their dry weight as fats; </li>
				  <li>Some  of them are present as surface lipids, the others as components of <strong>leaf cells</strong>, especially in the <strong>chloroplast membrane</strong>. </li>
				  <li>The  fatty acid composition of plant membrane lipids is very simple. </li>
				  <li>Six  fatty acids- palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic,linoleic and -linolenic  generally account for over 90% of the total fatty acids.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Waxes</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Waxes  are <strong>esters of long-chain saturated and  unsaturated fatty acids with long chain alcohol.</strong></li>
				  <li>The  carbon number of fatty acids vary from 14 to 34 and that alcohol from 16 to 30. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>For example, beeswax is an ester of  palmitic acid with a 30 carbon alcohol, <strong>triacontanol </strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Waxes  are the <strong>chief storage form of metabolic  fuel</strong> in marine phytoplanktons.</li>
				  <li>Biological  waxes find a variety of applications in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and other  industries.</li>
				  <li> Lanolin from lamb's wool, beeswax, carnauba  wax, spermaceti oil from whales are widely used in the <strong>manufacture of lotions, ointments and polishes</strong>.</li>
				  <li>Waxes  are not easily hydrolysed like fats or digested by lipases.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Liquid wax - Jojoba oil</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>About  50% of the <strong>seed dry weight of jojoba</strong> consists of a liquid wax which is unique in the plant kingdom and is similar to  sperm whale oil. </li>
				  <li>The  wax is made up of straight chain esters with an average total chain length of  42 carbons </li>
				  <li>Jojoba  wax has a wide range of industrial uses including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals,  extenders for plastics, printers ink, gear oil additives and various  lubricants. </li>
				  <li>The  oil is highly stable and can be stored for years without becoming rancid.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Cuticular  wax</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The  outermost surface of the cell walls of epidermal cells are covered with a <strong>hydrophobic cuticle</strong> which contains wax  called cuticular wax. </li>
				  <li>The  main components of cuticular waxes are hydrocarbon (odd chain alkanes) and its  derivatives, wax esters, free aldehydes, free acids, free alcohols and other  components like mono esters of phenolic acids and aliphatic alcohols. </li>
				  <li>The  main function of the cuticular wax is to <strong>reduce  the excessive losses and gains of water</strong> by the underlying tissue.</li>
				  <li> It also helps in protecting the tissues from  chemical, physical and biological attack.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Compound  lipids</strong><br />
				  Compound  lipids contain certain chemical groups in addition to alcohol and fatty acids. </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>These  group of lipids include <strong>glycerophospholipids,  sphingo phospholipids, glycolipids, sulpholipids and lipoproteins.</strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Glycerophospholipids</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The  important <strong>structural lipid in biological  membrane</strong> is glycero phospholipid which contains <strong>glycerol, fatty acids phosphoric acid and a nitrogenous base</strong>. </li>
				  <li>The  general structure of a glycerophospholipid is given below</li>
			    </ul>
				<ul>
				  <li>Without  alcoholic residue (X), it is called as <strong>phosphatidic  acid </strong></li>
				  <li>Depending  on the alcoholic residue attached to phosphatidic acid, they are named as       </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>            i. Phosphatidyl choline (lecithin)<br />
				             ii.  Phosphatidyl ethanolamine (cephalin)<br />
				             iii.  Phosphatidyl serine<br />
				             iv.  Phosphatidyl inositol<br />
				             v.  Phosphatidyl glycerol (which include monophosphatidyl glycerol and diphosphatidyl glycerol or  cardiolipin).<br />
  <strong>Phosphatidyl  choline (lecithin)</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Lecithin  contains <strong>glycerol, fatty acids,  phosphoric acid and a nitrogenous base, choline </strong></li>
				  <li>Lecithins  are widely distributed in the membranes of cells having both metabolic and  structural functions. </li>
				  <li><strong>Dipalmityl lecithin</strong> is a very effective <strong>surface active agent</strong> preventing adherence due to surface tension of the inner surfaces of the lungs.</li>
				  <li> Most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid  in the C1 position but an unsaturated fatty acid in the C2 position.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Phosphatidyl  ethanolamine (cephalin)</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The  cephalin differs from lecithin only in the nitrogenous group where ethanolamine  is present instead of choline </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Phosphatidyl  serine</strong> </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The  hydroxyl group of the amino acid L-serine is esterified to the phosphatidic  acid </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Phosphatidyl  inositol</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Phosphatidyl  inositol is an important <strong>constituent  of cell membrane phospholipids;</strong></li>
				  <li>upon  stimulation by a suitable animal hormone it is cleaved into <strong>diacylglycerol  and inositol phosphate,</strong> both of which act as <strong>internal signals or second messengers.</strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Phosphatidyl  glycerol and diphosphatidyl glycerol (Cardiolipin)</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Cardiolipin </strong>is a phospholipid that is found in <strong>membranes of mitochondria</strong>. </li>
				  <li>It  is formed from phosphatidylglycerol </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Sphingophospholipids</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The  phosphate and fatty acids are attached to the alcohol <strong>sphingosine </strong>instead of glycerol in sphingophospholipids. </li>
				  <li>The  fatty acids are attached through an <strong>amide  linkage</strong> rather than the ester linkage. </li>
				  <li>The base present is normally <strong>choline.</strong></li>
				  <li> The structure of the parent compound  sphingosine and phytosphingosine are shown below </li>
				  <li> C-1, C-2 and C-3 of the sphingosine or  phytosphingosine bear functional groups,-OH, -NH2 and -OH respectively, which  are structurally homologous with the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol.</li>
				  <li>Carbon  4 to 18 in sphingosine and C-5 to 18 in phytosphinogsine resembles that of a  fatty acid. </li>
				  <li>When  a fatty acid is attached by an amide linkage to the -NH2, group the  resulting compound is a <strong>ceramide</strong> which is similar to diacyl glycerol</li>
				  <li><strong>Ceramide</strong> is the fundamental structural unit common to all sphingophospholipids </li>
				  <li><strong>Sphingophospholipids</strong> are found in the seeds of several plant species. </li>
				  <li>There  is a range of molecular species among the phospholipid sub groups which differ  from one another in the fatty acid composition </li>
				  <li>All  the sub groups of phospholipids are found in plant photosynthetic tissue</li>
				  <li>Animal  phospholipids contain mostly fatty acids with chain length between 16 and 20.  The predominant fatty acids are palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and  arachidonic.</li>
				  <li>Plant  leaf phospholipids have a more limited range with very few fatty acids greater  than C-18. </li>
				  <li>The  approximate proportion of each phospholipid expressed as a percentage of the  total phospholipid present is phosphatidyl choline, 45%; phosphatidyl  ethanolamine, 10%; </li>
				  <li>Trace  amounts of phosphatidyl serine, phosphatidyl inositol, 8%; monophosphatidyl  glycerol, 35%, diphosphatidylglycerol, 2%. </li>
				  <li>The <strong>diphosphatidyl glycerol</strong> is present in the <strong>inner mitochondrial membrane.</strong> </li>
				  <li>The  phospholipids are only <strong>minor  components of seed lipids</strong> in which triacylglycerol predominate. </li>
				  <li>The <strong>most abundant</strong> mammalian  phospholipid is <strong>phosphatidyl  choline</strong>. </li>
				  <li>The  phospholipids carry an electrical charge and interact with water. They are  called as <strong>polar or hydrophilic molecules  and also as amphiphilic  molecules</strong>. </li>
				  <li>The  sphingomyelins, the main sphingophospholipids of animals, are not present in  plants.</li>
		        </ul>
				<p><strong>Glycolipids  and sulpholipids</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Glycolipids  are structurally characterised by the presence of one or more monosaccharide  residues and the <strong>absence of a phosphate.</strong><strong></strong></li>
				  <li> They are O-glycoside of either sphingosine or  glycerol derivative. The monosaccharides commonly attached are <strong>D-glucose,  D-galactose or N-acetyl D-galactosamine. </strong></li>
				  <li>Monogalactosyl  diglycerides and digalactosyl diglycerides have been shown to be present in a  wide variety of higher plant tissues </li>
				  <li>The  3 position of 1, 2-diacylglycerol is linked to 6- sulpho-6-deoxy D-glucose by  an <strong>-glycosidic bond in plant  sulpholipid</strong> </li>
				  <li>The  predominant fatty acid present in sulpholipid is <strong>linolenic acid. </strong></li>
				  <li>The  sulpholipid is mostly present in <strong>chloroplasts,  predominantly in the membranes of thylakoid. </strong></li>
				  <li><strong>Cerebrosides </strong>are  composed of a monosaccharide residue glycosidically linked to C-1 of an  N-acylated sphingosine derivative.</li>
				  <li> The monosaccharide is <strong>D-glucose in plants</strong> and <strong>D-galactose in animals</strong>.</li>
</ul>
				<p><strong>Lipoprotein</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Protein  molecules associated with triacylglycerol, cholesterol or phospholipids  are  called lipoproteins.</li>
				  <li>Triacylglycerols  derived from intestinal absorption or from the liver are not transported in the  free form in circulating blood plasma, but move as <strong>chylomicrons, as very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) or as free fatty  acids (FFA) - albumin complexes. </strong></li>
				  <li>Besides,  two more physiologically important groups of lipoproteins are <strong>low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high  density lipoprotein (HDL). </strong></li>
				  <li>The major lipid components  of <strong>chylomicrons and VLDL are triacylglycerol,</strong> whereas the predominant  lipids in <strong>LDL and HDL are cholesterol and phospholipid respectively. </strong></li>
				  <li>The protein part of  lipoprotein is known as <strong>apoprotein.</strong></li>
				  <li> Lipoproteins occur in milk, egg-yolk and also  as <strong>components of cell membranes</strong></li>
</ul>
				<p><strong>Sterols</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The  characteristic structure of sterol is their <strong>steroid nucleus</strong> consisting  of four fused rings, three with six carbons (Phenanthrene) and one with five  carbons (cyclopentane). </li>
				  <li>This  parent structure is known as <strong>perhydro  cyclopentano phenanthrene</strong>.</li>
				  <li>The  steroid nucleus is almost <strong>planar </strong>and relatively rigid. </li>
				  <li>Steroids  with methyl groups attached to carbons 10 and 13 and 8-10 carbon atoms in the  side chain at position 17, <strong>an  alcoholic group at position 3 and a double bond between carbons 5 and 6 are  classified as sterols. </strong></li>
				  <li><strong>Cholesterol</strong> is the <strong>most abundant sterol</strong> in animals. </li>
				  <li>Cholesterol  is a <strong>major component of animal  plasma membranes</strong> and occurs in lesser amounts in the membranes of  their subcellular organelles. </li>
				  <li>Its  polar OH group gives it a <strong>weak  amphiphilic character</strong>, whereas its fused ring system provides it  with greater stability than other membrane lipids. </li>
				  <li>Cholesterol  is therefore an <strong>important  determinant of membrane properties</strong>. </li>
				  <li>It  is also abundant in blood plasma lipoproteins where 70% of it is esterified to  long chain fatty acids to form cholesteryl esters.</li>
				  <li>Plants  contain little cholesterol. Rather, the most common sterol components of their  membranes are <strong>stigmasterol and -sitosterol</strong> which differ from cholesterol only in their aliphatic side chains. </li>
				  <li>Yeast  and fungi have another sterol named <strong>ergosterol</strong> which has a double bond between C7 and C8. </li>
				  <li>In  animal system, cholesterol functions as a <strong>precursor  of various physiologically important compounds such as vitamin D, bile acids,  female sex hormones and corticosteroids</strong>. </li>
				  <li>In  plants, cholesterol functions as an intermediate compound in the <strong>synthesis of various phytosteroids</strong> such as <strong>saponins, cardiac  glycosides, phytoecdysteroids and brassinosteroids. </strong></li>
</ul>
				<p><strong>Brassinosteroids</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>In  1979, a <strong>novel plant growth  regulating steroidal substance</strong> called <strong>brassinolide </strong>was  isolated from rape (Brassica napus)  pollen </li>
				  <li>More  than 24 compounds are known (designated as BR1, BR2). </li>
				  <li>Pollen is the richest source.</li>
				  <li>Brassinosterols  are active at concentration much lower (nM to pM range) than those of other  types of hormones. </li>
				  <li>Brassinosterols  elicit a pronounced <strong>stem elongation  response</strong> in dwarf pea epicotyls, mung bean epicotyls that are  sensitive also to gibberellic acids but not auxins.</li>
				  <li>Brassinosteroids  are thought by some to be a new class of plant hormones. </li>
				  <li>The  evidences are </li>
</ul>
				<p>i.  They are widely distributed in the plant kingdom.<br />
				  ii.  They have an <strong>effect at extremely  low concentration.</strong><br />
				  iii.  They have a range of effects which are different from the other classes of plant hormones.<br />
				  iv.  They can be <strong>applied to one part of  the plant and transported to another </strong><br />
  <strong>     where in  very low amounts elicit a biological response.</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>They  are widely distributed including dicots, monocots, gymnosperms and algae, and  in various plant parts such as pollen, leaves, flowers, seeds, shoots and  stems. </li>
				  <li>Among  the naturally occurring <strong>brassinosteroids, brassinolide and castasterone </strong>are  considered to be the most important because of their wide distribution as well  as their potent physiological activity.</li>
</ul>
				<p><strong>Physiological  effects of brassinosteroids</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Promotion of ethylene  biosynthesis by <strong>stimulating ACC  synthase activity</strong>.</li>
				  <li>Promote <strong>elongation of vegetative tissue</strong> in a wide variety of plants at very low concentration.</li>
				  <li>They are powerful inhibitors  of root growth and development (via ethylene).</li>
				  <li>They have been shown to  interfere with ecdysteroids at their site of action, and are thus the first  true <strong>antiecdysteroids.</strong> </li>
				  <li>They enhance <strong>resistance to chilling, disease, herbicides</strong> and salt stress, promote germination and decrease fruit abortion and drop.</li>
</ul>
				<p><strong>Practical  application of BR</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Large  scale field trials in China and Japan over a six year period have shown that <strong>24-epibrassinolide</strong>,  an alternative to brassinolide, increased the production of agronomic and  horticultural crops (<strong>wheat, corn,  tobacco, watermelon and cucumber).</strong></li>
				  <li><strong>Environmental  stresses</strong> were also seem to be allievated by treatment  with brassinolide.</li>
</ul>
				<p><strong>Properties of fat</strong><br />
                    <strong>Physical</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Fats  are greasy to touch and leave an oily impression on paper. </li>
				  <li>They  are <strong>insoluble in water</strong> and soluble in organic solvents. </li>
				  <li>Pure  triacylglycerols are tasteless, odourless, colourless and neutral in reaction. </li>
				  <li>They  have <strong>lesser specific gravity</strong> (density) than water and therefore float in  water.</li>
				  <li>Though  fats are insoluble in water, they can be broken down into minute dropletsand  dispersed in water. This is called <strong>emulsification</strong>. </li>
				  <li>A  satisfactory emulsion is one highly stable and contains very minute droplets  with diameter less than 0.5 m. </li>
				  <li>Examples  of <strong>naturally occurring emulsions  are milk and yolk of egg</strong>. But they are not mere fat droplets in  water. </li>
				  <li>They  contain hydrophilic colloidal particles such as proteins, carbohydrates and  phospholipids which act as stabilizing agents.</li>
				  <li><strong>Emulsification greatly increases the surface area  of the fat</strong> and this is an essential requisite for digestion of fat in the  intestine.</li>
</ul>
				<p><strong>Chemical</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The  most important chemical reaction of neutral fat is their hydrolysis to yield</li>
</ul>
				<p>three molecules Alkali hydrolysis (saponification)The  process of alkali hydrolysis is called '<strong>saponification' </strong></p>
			
				<p align="center"><img width="440" height="199" src="lec07_clip_image002.jpg" /></p>
		
                <ul>
                  <li>The <strong>alkali salt of fatty acid</strong> resulting from saponification is <strong>soap</strong>. </li>
                  <li>The  soaps we use for washing consists of Na or K salts of fatty acids like <strong>palmitic, stearic and oleic acid.</strong></li>
                  <li>The  potassium soaps are soft and soluble whereas the sodium soaps are hard and less  soluble in water.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Enzyme hydrolysis</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Hydrolysis  of triacylglycerol may be accomplished enzymatically through the action of <strong>lipases.</strong> </li>
                  <li>Lipases  are widespread in both plants and animals.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Rancidity</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Development  of disagreeable odour and taste in fat or oil upon storage is called <strong>rancidity.</strong></li>
                  <li> Rancidity reactions may be due to <strong>hydrolysis  of ester bonds</strong> (hydrolytic rancidity) or due to <strong>oxidation of unsaturated  fatty acids</strong> (oxidative rancidity).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Hydrolytic rancidity</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>This  involves <strong>partial hydrolysis of the  triacylglycerol</strong> to mono and diacylglycerol.</li>
                  <li>The  hydrolysis is hastened by the presence of <strong>moisture, warmth and lipases</strong> present in fats or air. </li>
                  <li>In  fats like butter which contains a high percentage of volatile fatty  acids,hydrolytic rancidity produces disagreeable odour and taste due to the  liberation of the <strong>volatile butyric  acid</strong>. </li>
                  <li>Butter  becomes rancid more easily in summer.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong><br clear="all" />
                </strong>
                <p><strong>Oxidative rancidity</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The  unsaturated fatty acids are oxidised at the double bonds to form <strong>peroxides</strong>,  which then decompose to form aldehydes and acids of objectionable odour and  taste.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Hydrogenation</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The <strong>degree of unsaturation</strong> of the fatty acids present in triacylglycerol determines whether a fat is  liquid or solid at room temperature. </li>
                  <li>The  presence of more unsaturated fatty  acids <strong>lower the melting  point</strong>. </li>
                  <li>The  presence of highly unsaturated fatty acids makes the oil more susceptible to <strong>oxidative deterioration</strong>.</li>
                  <li> The objective of hydrogenation is to <strong>reduce the degree of unsaturation and to  increase the melting point of the oil. </strong></li>
                  <li>The  oil can be selectively hydrogenated by careful choice of <strong>catalyst and temperature. </strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Hydrogenation of unsaturated fats in the presence  of a catalyst</strong> is known as <strong>hardening</strong>. </li>
                  <li>Normally  the process of hydrogenation is partial so as to get desired characteristics  and to avoid products with high melting points. </li>
                  <li>Hydrogenation  is carried out in a closed container in the presence of <strong>finely powdered  catalyst (0.05 - 0.2% of nickel) at temperature as high as 180oC</strong>.</li>
                  <li> The catalyst is usually removed by <strong>filtration. </strong></li>
                  <li>During  hydrogenation process a proportion of the <strong>cis double bonds are isomerized to trans double bonds </strong>and  there is also <strong>migration of double  bonds</strong>. </li>
                  <li>The  hydrogenation process has made it possible to extend the food uses of a number  of vegetable oils and marine oils whose melting points are too low.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Constants of fats and oils</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Since  fats and oils form essential nutrient of human diet, it is necessary <strong>to identify a pure fat or to determine the  proportion of different types of fat or oil mixed as adulterant in edible oils  and fats like butter and ghee. </strong></li>
                  <li>With  an adequate knowledge of the characteristic composition of fats or oils, it is  possible to identify the fat or oil under investigation. </li>
                  <li><strong>The chemical constants also give an idea about the  nature of fatty acids present in fats or oils. </strong></li>
                  <li>Even  though <strong>gas chromatographic method</strong> is available to identify and quantify the fatty acids present in fat or oil,  the physical and chemical constants are still used in routine public health  laboratories where such sophisticated facilities are lacking.</li>
