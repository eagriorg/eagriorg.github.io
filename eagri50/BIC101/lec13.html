                <p align="right"><img src="images/back.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="30" usemap="#Map" />
				<p><strong>Conformation of a protein </strong>refers  to<strong> </strong>the<strong> three-dimensional structure </strong>in its<strong> native state.</strong> There are many different possible conformations for  a molecule as large as a protein. A protein can perform its function only when  it is in its <strong>native condition</strong>. Due  to the complexity of three-dimensional structures, the structure of protein is  discussed at <strong>different levels of its  organization</strong>.<br />
				  Four  levels of structural organization can be distinguished in proteins:<br />
  <strong>1. Primary</strong><br />
  <strong>2. Secondary</strong><br />
  <strong>3. Tertiary</strong><br />
  <strong>4. Quaternary</strong><br />
  <strong>Primary  structure</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Primary  structure of protein refers to the <strong>number  of amino acids and the order in which they are covalently linked together. </strong></li>
				  <li>It  also refers to the location of disulfide bridges, if there are any, in a  polypeptide chain.</li>
				  <li>The  peptide bond is <strong>covalent</strong> in nature, <strong>quiet stable</strong> and referred as <strong>backbone of the protein. </strong></li>
				  <li>They  can be disrupted by chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis but are not directly  influenced by salt concentration, change in pH or solvent.</li>
				  <li><strong>Frederick Sanger</strong> in 1953 determined the complete amino acid sequence of insulin for the first  time.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>The  important steps involved in determining the primary structure of protein are</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Determination  of number of (chemically different) polypeptide chains or subunits in the  protein.</li>
				  <li>Separation  of polypeptide chains if more than one are present in a protein.</li>
				  <li>Determination  of the amino acid sequence of the subunits.</li>
				  <li>Elucidation  of the position of the disulfide bonds, if any, between and within the  subunits.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>1.  Determination of number of polypeptides or subunits</strong><br />
				  Determination  of the number of C-terminal or N-terminal amino acids will indicate the number  of polypeptides in a protein.<br />
				  H2N  -------------------&gt; COOH<br />
				  N-terminal                     C-terminal</p>
				<p><strong>N-terminal  identification</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Fluoro dinitro benzene  (FDNB),</strong> known as Sanger's reagent, was used to  identify the N-terminal amino acid. </li>
				  <li>This  reagent was replaced by <strong>dansyl chloride  and Edman's reagent (phenyl isothiocyanate, PITC).</strong></li>
				  <li>Edman's  reagent is also used to determine the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide  chain from the N-terminal by subjecting the polypeptide to repeated cycles of  Edman degradation. </li>
				  <li>After  every cycle, the newly liberated <strong>phenylthiohydantoin  (PTH) amino acid</strong> was identified </li>
				  <li>The  sequence of peptides containing 30-40 amino acids can be determined using a  sequencer by adopting the Edman's degradation method.<strong> </strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>C-terminal  identification</strong><br />
				  C-terminal  amino acid can be determined by methods similar to those used for the  N-terminal acid. </p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Hydrazine</strong> is used to find out the C-terminal amino acid. </li>
				  <li>It  reacts with the <strong>carbonyl group of each  peptide bond</strong> except C-terminal amino acid. </li>
				  <li>The  bond is cleaved and each amino acid derivative is released as the hydrazide  derivative (hydrazinolysis). </li>
				  <li>Since  the carboxyl group of C-terminal amino acid is not involved in a peptide bond,  it remains in the mixture as the only unmodified amino acid </li>
				  <li>After  chromatographic separation and comparison with the standards, the C-terminal  amino acid can be identified. </li>
				  <li>Carboxypeptidases  are used for enzymic determination of the C-terminal amio acid.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Separation  and purification of polypeptide chains</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Determination  of C-terminal and/or N-terminal amino acids reveals the presence of one or more  polypeptide chains in a protein. </li>
				  <li>If  the protein contains more than one polypeptide chain, separation of polypeptide  chain is essential. </li>
				  <li>If  the polypeptide chains are connected by disulfide bond, they are cleaved to  separate the individual peptide chains.</li>
				  <li>The  polypeptide is treated with <strong>2-mercaptoethanol</strong> (HS-CH2-CH2OH) so that reductive cleavage occurs and the  polypeptide chains are separated.</li>
				  <li> The resulting free-SH groups are usually  alkylated by treatment with <strong>iodoacetic  acid </strong></li>
				  <li>After  cleaving the disulfide links using mercaptoethanol, subunits are dissociated  using denaturing agents such <strong>as urea or  guinidinum ion or detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). </strong></li>
				  <li>The  dissociated subunits are then separated using ion exchange or gel filtration  chromatographic method.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Amino  acid sequencing of polypeptides</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The  amino acid sequence in polypeptides with 30-40 amino acids can be determined by  Edman reaction. </li>
				  <li>For  polypeptides containing <strong>more than 40  amino acids</strong>, both enzymatic and chemical methods are employed to break  polypeptide chains into smaller peptides. </li>
				  <li>The  enzyme, <strong>trypsin</strong> hydrolyses the  peptide bond on the <strong>carboxyl side of the  basic amino acid residues of lysine or arginine</strong>. </li>
				  <li>The  chemical reagent, <strong>cyanogens bromide</strong> cleaves peptide bond on the <strong>carboxyl side  of methionine residues.</strong> </li>
				  <li>The  hydrolyzed peptides are separated and the amino acid sequence is determined by  Edman reaction. </li>
				  <li>The  hydrolysis of the original polypeptide by two different methods separately  gives overlapping regions, from which the sequence is derived </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Secondary  structure</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Secondary  structure refers to the <strong>steric  relationship of amino acids that are close to one another in the linear  sequence</strong>. </li>
				  <li>The  folding of a linear polypeptide chain occurs to form a specific coiled  structure. </li>
				  <li>Such  coiling or folding is maintained by <strong>hydrogen  bonds </strong>and hydrogen bond is the only bond responsible for secondary  structure. </li>
				  <li>X-ray  studies of several polypeptides by <strong>Linus  Pauling and Robert Corey</strong> revealed that the peptide group has a <strong>rigid, planar structure</strong> which is a  consequence of <strong>resonance interactions</strong> that give the peptide bond a 40% double bond character. </li>
				  <li>Peptide  groups mostly assume the <strong>transconformation </strong>in which successive C2 atoms are on opposite sides of peptide  bond joining them. </li>
				  <li>The  cis configuration creates steric interference.</li>
				  <li> If a polypeptide chain is twisted by the same  amount each of its C atoms, it assumes a helical conformation </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Helix  structure</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The  -helix is the <strong>most stable</strong> arrangement of polypeptides </li>
				  <li>The helix  structure of proteins is stabilized by <strong>intramolecular  hydrogen bonding</strong>.</li>
				  <li>In  this structure, <strong>hydrogen bonds are  formed between the C=O group of one peptide bond and the N-H group of another  after 3 amino acid units</strong>.</li>
				  <li>The  polypeptide chain constituted by <strong>L-amino  acids form a right-handed helix</strong>, whereas the polypeptide chains made up of  D-amino acids form a left-handed helix. </li>
				  <li>In  the -helical conformation, <strong>all the side  chains lie outside the helix</strong> whereas C, N, O and H of the peptide bond lie  in the same plane.</li>
				  <li>Certain  amino acids tend to <strong>disrupt the -helix</strong>. Among these  are <strong>proline </strong>(the N atoms is part of  the rigid ring and no rotation of the N-C bond can occur) and <strong>amino acid with charged or bulk R groups</strong> that either electrostatically or physically interferes with helix formation.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>The  -pleated sheet  structure</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Pauling and Corey</strong> also proposed a second ordered structure, the -pleated sheet for polypeptide. </li>
				  <li>This  structure is a <strong>result of intermolecular  hydrogen bonding</strong> between the polypeptide chains to form a <strong>sheet like arrangement.</strong></li>
				  <li>There  are two ways in which proteins chains can form the pleated sheet structure.</li>
				  <li>One  is with the <strong>chains running in the same  direction</strong> i.e. the -COOH or NH2 ends of the polypeptide chains  lying all at the top or all at the bottom of the sheet. This is called <strong>parallel pleated-sheet structure. </strong></li>
				  <li>In  another type, known as <strong>antiparallel -pleated  sheet structure</strong>, the polypeptide chains alternate in such a way that the  -COOH end of the one polypeptide is next to the -NH2 end of the  other i.e. polypeptide chains run in opposite directions.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>The  random coil</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Regions  of proteins that are <strong>not identifiably  organized as helices or pleated sheets</strong> are said to be present in <strong>random coil conformation</strong>. </li>
				  <li>Considerable  portion of the protein may be present in this conformation. </li>
				  <li>The  term 'random' is unfortunate which imply less biological significance than more  highly repeating regions. </li>
				  <li>But  in terms of biological function, the regions of random coil are of equal  importance to those of helix and pleated sheet.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Tertiary structure</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Tertiary  structure refers to the <strong>steric  relationship of amino acid residues that are far apart in the linear sequence. </strong></li>
				  <li>This  leads to the twisting of polypeptide chains into <strong>specific loops and bends</strong> which are maintained chiefly by five kinds  of bonds.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Hydrogen  bonds</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Hydrogen  bonds are formed between the side chain (R group) of amino acids having a  hydrogen donor group and an acceptor group </li>
			    </ul>
				<p align="center"><strong><img width="374" height="224" src="lec13_clip_image002.jpg" /></strong><br />
                    <strong>Salt-linkages  (electrostatic forces; ionic bonds)</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Salt  linkages are due to the interaction between amino groups of basic amino acids  and the carboxyl group of acidic amino acids present in the R group</li>
			    </ul>
				<p align="center"><strong><img width="310" height="130" src="lec13_clip_image004.jpg" /></strong><br />
                    <strong>Disulfide  bonds (S-S linkages)</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The  S-S linkages are formed by the oxidation of sulfhydryl (-SH) group of two  cysteine side chains </li>
			    </ul>
				<p align="center"><strong><img width="264" height="98" src="lec13_clip_image006.jpg" /></strong><br />
                    <strong>Hydrophobic  bonds</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Hydrophobic  bonds are formed as a result of interaction between non-polar side chains </li>
			    </ul>
				<p align="center"><strong><img width="276" height="238" src="lec13_clip_image008.jpg" /></strong><br />
                    <strong>Dipole-dipole  interaction</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>This  interaction occurs between <strong>polar  unionized side chains</strong> </li>
				  <li>The  folding of a polypeptide chain due to different covalent and non-covalent  interactions is shown below.</li>
				  <li>Out  of the above bonds, <strong>the disulfide bond  (covalent bond) is the strongest and cannot be affected by solvent, pH,  temperature and salts</strong> whereas the above conditions.</li>
				  <li>The  disulfide bond can be split and reformed by oxidation/reduction respectively</li>
				  <li> The tertiary structure gains special  importance in the <strong>case of enzymes</strong>.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p align="center"><strong><img width="312" height="105" src="lec13_clip_image010.jpg" /></strong><br />
                    <strong>Domain</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Domains  are <strong>structurally independent units</strong> that have the characteristics of a small globular protein. </li>
				  <li>Domains  often have a specific function such as the <strong>binding  of a small molecule.</strong></li>
				  <li>A  long peptide strand of a protein will often fold into <strong>multiple, compact semiindependent folded regions or domains. </strong></li>
				  <li>Each  domain having a <strong>characteristic spherical  geometry</strong> with a hydrophobic core and polar surface very much like the  tertiary structure of a whole globular protein</li>
				  <li>The  domains of a multidomain protein are often interconnected by a segment of  polypeptide chain lacking regular secondary structure.</li>
				  <li>In  enzymes with more than one substrate or <strong>allosteric  effector sites the different binding sites are often located in different  domains.</strong> </li>
				  <li>In  multifunctional proteins, the different domains perform different tasks.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Quaternary  structure</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Proteins  that have <strong>more than one subunit or  polypeptide chains</strong> will exhibit quaternary structure. </li>
				  <li>Quaternary  structure refers to a <strong>functional protein  aggregate  (organization</strong>) formed by interpolypeptide  linkage of subunits or polypeptide chains.</li>
				  <li>These  subunits are held together by <strong>noncovalent  surface interaction</strong> between the polar side chains. </li>
				  <li>Proteins  formed like above are termed <strong>oligomers </strong>and  the individual polypeptide chains are variously termed protomers, monomers or  subunits. </li>
				  <li>The  most common oligomeric proteins contain two or four protomers and are termed  dimers or tetramers, respectively.</li>
				  <li><strong>Myoglobin</strong> has no quaternary structure since, it is composed of a single polypeptide  chain. </li>
				  <li><strong>Hemoglobin molecule</strong>,  which consists of <strong>four separate  polypeptide</strong> <strong>chains</strong>, exhibits  quaternary structure.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Hemoglobin.jpg" title="A schematic of hemoglobin.

				<p align="center">A schematic of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin" title="Hemoglobin">hemoglobin</a>. </p>
				<p align="center">The ribbon parts represent the protein <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globin" title="Globin">globin</a>; the four  green parts are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme" title="Heme">heme</a> groups. </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Quaternary  structure may influence the activity of enzymes. </li>
				  <li>Some  enzymes are active only in their quaternary state and become inactive when  split into smaller units.</li>
				  <li>Other  enzymes are inactive in the quaternary state and are activated only when they  are dissociated to form monomeric state.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Physical and chemical  properties of proteins</strong><br />
                    <strong>Physical</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Pure  proteins are generally tasteless, though the predominant taste of protein  hydrolysates is bitter. </li>
				  <li>Pure  proteins are odourless. </li>
				  <li>Because  of the large size of the molecules, proteins exhibit many properties that are <strong>colloidal in nature</strong>. </li>
				  <li>Proteins,  like amino acids, are <strong>amphoteric</strong> and  contain both acidic and basic groups. </li>
				  <li>They  possess <strong>electrically charged groups</strong> and hence <strong>migrate in an electric field</strong>.</li>
				  <li> Many proteins are <strong>labile</strong> and readily modified by alterations in <strong>pH, UV radiation, heat and by many organic solvents.</strong></li>
				  <li>The <strong>absorption spectrum of protein</strong> is  maximum at 280 nm due to the presence of <strong>tyrosine  and tryptophan</strong>, which are the strongest <strong>chromophores</strong> in that region.</li>
				  <li>Hence  the absorbance of the protein at this wavelength is adapted for its  determination.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Denaturation  of protein</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The  comparatively weak forces responsible for maintaining secondary, tertiary and  quaternary structure of proteins are readily disrupted with <strong>resulting loss of biological activity. </strong></li>
				  <li><strong>This disruption of native  structure is termed denaturation</strong>.</li>
				  <li> Physically, denaturation is viewed as <strong>randomizing the conformation of a  polypeptide chain without affecting its primary structure</strong> </li>
				  <li>Physical  and chemical factors are involved in the denaturation of protein</li>
				  <li><strong>Heat  and UV radiation</strong> supply kinetic energy to protein  molecules causing th      atoms to  vibrate rapidly, thus disrupting the relatively weak hydrogen bonds and salt  linkages. This results in denaturation of protein leading to coagulation. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>           Enzymes easily digest denatured or  coagulated proteins.<br />
				  b)      <strong>Organic  solvents</strong> such as ethyl alcohol and acetone are capable of forming<br />
				  intermolecular hydrogen bonds with protein  disrupting the intramolecular     <br />
				  hydrogen bonding. This causes precipitation  of protein.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Acidic  and basic reagents</strong> cause changes in pH, which  alter the charges present   on the side  chain of protein disrupting the salt linkages.</li>
				  <li><strong>Salts  of heavy metal ions (Hg2+, Pb2+)</strong> form very strong  bonds with  </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>carboxylate  anions of aspartate and glutamate thus disturbing the salt linkages.    This property makes some of the heavy metal  salts suitable for use as antiseptics.<br />
                    <strong>Renaturation</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Renaturation  refers to <strong>the attainment of an original,  regular three-dimensional functional protein after its denaturation.</strong></li>
				  <li>When  active pancreatic ribonuclease A is treated with <strong>8M urea or mercaptoethanol,</strong> it is converted to an inactive, denatured molecule. </li>
				  <li>When  urea or mercaptoethanol is removed, it attains its native (active) conformation.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Chemical</strong><br />
                    <strong>Colour  reactions of proteins</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The  colour reactions of proteins are of importance in the qualitative detection and  quantitative estimation of proteins and their constituent amino acids.</li>
				  <li><strong>Biuret test </strong>is  extensively used as a test to detect proteins in biological materials.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Biuret  reaction</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>A  compound, which is having more than one <strong>peptide  bond</strong> when treated with Biuret reagent, produces a <strong>violet colour</strong>. This is due to the formation of <strong>coordination complex between four nitrogen atoms of two polypeptide  chains and one copper atom</strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p align="center"><img border="0" width="348" height="210" src="lec13_clip_image013.jpg" /><br />
                    <strong>Xanthoproteic  reaction</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Addition  of <strong>concentrated nitric acid</strong> to  protein produces <strong>yellow colour</strong> on  heating, the colour changes to <strong>orange</strong> when the solution is made alkaline. The yellow stains upon the skin caused by  nitric acid are the result of this xanthoproteic reaction. This is due to the<strong> nitration of the phenyl rings of aromatic  amino acids.</strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Hopkins-Cole  reaction</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Indole ring of tryptophan</strong> reacts with glacial acetic acid in the presence of <strong>concentrated sulphuric acid</strong> and forms <strong>a purple</strong> coloured product. Glacial acetic acid reacts with  concentrated sulphuric acid and forms glyoxalic acid, which in turn reacts with  indole ring of tryptophan in the presence of sulphuric acid forming a <strong>purple coloured</strong> product.</li>
			    </ul>
