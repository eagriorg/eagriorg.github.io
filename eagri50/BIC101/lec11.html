				</p>
				<p>The  word &quot;Protein&quot; was coined by <strong>J.J.  Berzelius</strong> in 1838 and was derived from the Greek word <strong>&quot;Proteios&quot;</strong> meaning the ‘<strong>first rank’</strong>. </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Proteins  are macromolecular polymers composed of <strong>amino  acids</strong> as the basic unit linked by peptide bonds.</li>
				  <li>Amino  acids are the <strong>fundamental structural  units of all proteins</strong>.</li>
				  <li>These  biopolymers contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur. </li>
				  <li>The  elementary composition of most proteins is very similar; approximate  percentages are C=50-55, H=6-8, O=20-23, N=15-18 and S=Traces </li>
			    </ul>
				<p> <strong>Occurrence       </strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Proteins  are found in all <strong>living cells</strong>. </li>
				  <li>They  form essential <strong>constituent of  protoplasm, cell membrane and nuclear material. </strong></li>
				  <li>They  may be present as simple proteins or complexes with lipids or nucleic acids. </li>
				  <li>Proteins  from different tissues such as <strong>muscle,  bone, brain, blood and other biological fluids </strong>differ in composition and  properties. </li>
				  <li>In  cereal and leguminous plants, <strong>seeds</strong> contain comparatively higher amounts of protein than stem, leaves and flowers. </li>
				  <li>Tuber  crops usually contain less amounts of protein in all parts.</li>
				  <li><strong>Enzymes </strong>are  specialized proteins with <strong>catalytic  activities</strong> and are present in all living organisms. </li>
				  <li>Proteins  serve as <strong>regulators of metabolic  reactions</strong>, directly as components of enzymes and indirectly in the form of  chemical messengers known as  <strong>hormones</strong> as well as receptors for  hormones. </li>
				  <li>They <strong>regulate and integrate</strong> the numerous  physiological and metabolic processes in the body. </li>
				  <li>Proteins  are the <strong>center of action</strong> in many  biological processes.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Amino acids</strong><br />
				  All  proteins are formed from <strong>20 </strong>different<strong> amino acids</strong>. All the amino acids have  trivial or common names based on the source from which they were first isolated  or based on their properties. For eg.<br />
				  <strong>Asparagine</strong> was named so, as it was isolated from asparagus and <strong>glycine</strong> was so named because of its sweet taste (Greek:'glykos'  meaning sweet).<br />
				  All  the 20 amino acids, except <strong>proline</strong>,  found in proteins have an amino group and a carboxyl group attached to the same  carbon atom, namely the <strong>-carbon</strong>.  They differ only in the side chains (R groups). The 20 amino acids found in  proteins are referred as the <strong>standard or  normal or protein amino acids</strong>. <br />
				  There  are many other amino acids found in nature but do not occur in proteins. They  are referred as <strong>non-protein amino acids</strong>.<br />
  <strong>Classification of protein amino acids</strong><br />
				  The  protein amino acids are classified according to the <strong>chemical nature</strong> of their R groups as <strong>aliphatic, aromatic, heterocyclic and sulphur containing amino acids</strong>.  More meaningful classification of amino acids is based on the <strong>polarity of the R groups</strong>. The polarity  of the R groups varies widely from totally non-polar to highly polar. The 20  amino acids are classified into four main classes whose structures,  three-letter and one-letter symbols are given below<br />
  <strong>a) Amino acids with  non-polar or hydrophobic, aliphatic R groups</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>This group of amino acids  includes <strong>glycine, alanine, valine,  leucine, isoleucine and proline.</strong> The hydrocarbon R groups are non-polar and  hydrophobic. </li>
				  <li>The side chains of alanine,  valine, leucine and isoleucine are important in promoting hydrophobic  interactions within protein structures. </li>
				  <li>The minimal steric hindrance  of the glycine side chain (hydrogen) allows more flexibility than other amino  acids.</li>
				  <li> On the other hand, the imino group of proline  is held in a rigid conformation and reduces the structural flexibility of the  protein.</li>
			    </ul>
				<strong><br clear="all" />
                </strong>
                <p><strong>b)  Amino acids with non-polar aromatic R groups</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>This group includes <strong>phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan</strong> . </li>
                  <li>All these amino acids  participate in <strong>hydrophobic interactions</strong>,  which is stronger than aliphatic R groups because of stacking one another. </li>
                  <li>Tyrosine and tryptophan are  more polar than phenylalanine due to the presence of hydroxyl group in tyrosine  and nitrogen in the indole ring of tryptophan. </li>
                  <li>The absorption of  ultraviolet (UV) light at 280 nm by tyrosine, tryptophan and to a lesser extent  by phenylalanine is responsible for the characteristic strong absorbance of  light by proteins. This property is exploited in the characterization and  quantification of proteins.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>c)  Amino acids with polar, uncharged R groups</strong></p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>This       group of amino acids includes <strong>serine,       threonine, cysteine, methionine, asparagine and glutamine .</strong></li>
                  <li> The hydroxyl group of <strong>serine and threonine</strong>, the sulphur       atom of <strong>cysteine and methionine</strong> and the amide group of <strong>asparagine       and glutamine</strong>, contribute to the polarity. </li>
                  <li>The       R groups of these amino acids are more hydrophilic than the non-polar       amino acids.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>d)  Amino acids with charged R groups</strong></p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li><strong>Acidic:</strong> The two amino acids with acidic R groups are <strong>aspartic and glutamic acids. </strong> These amino acids have a net negative       charge at pH 7.0.</li>
                  <li><strong> Basic:</strong> This group includes <strong>lysine,       arginine and histidine</strong> . The R groups have a net positive charge at pH       7.0. The <strong>lysine</strong> has a second -amino       group; <strong>arginine</strong> has a       positively charged guanidino group; and <strong>histidine </strong>has an imidazole group.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Properties of amino acids</strong><br />
                    <strong>Physical</strong></p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Amino       acids are white crystalline substances. </li>
                  <li>Most       of them are <strong>soluble in water</strong> and insoluble in non-polar organic solvents (e.g., chloroform and ether). </li>
                  <li>Aliphatic       and aromatic amino acids particularly those having several carbon atoms       have limited solubility in water but readily soluble in polar organic       solvents. </li>
                  <li>They       have <strong>high melting points</strong> varying from 200-300oC or even more. </li>
                  <li>They       are tasteless, sweet or bitter. </li>
                  <li>Some       are having good flavour. <strong>Sodium       glutamate</strong> is a valuable flavouring agent and is used in the       preparation of certain dishes and sauces.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Amphoteric nature of amino acids</strong></p>
                <ul >
                  <li>Amino       acids are <strong>amphoteric</strong> compounds,       as they contain <strong>both acidic (COOH) </strong>and<strong> basic (NH2) groups.</strong></li>
                  <li>They       can react with both alkalies and acids to form salts. </li>
                  <li>In <strong>acid solution</strong> amino acids carry <strong>positive charges</strong> and hence they       move towards cathode in an electric field.</li>
                  <li>In <strong>alkaline solution</strong>, the amino       acids carry negative charges and therefore move towards anode. </li>
                  <li>When       an amino acid is dissolved in water, it exists as <strong>inner salt</strong> carrying both positive and negative charges.This       occurs as a result of dissociation of carboxyl group to release the H+       ion, which passes from the carboxyl to the amino group. The amino acids       possessing <strong>both positive and       negative charges</strong> are called <strong>zwitterions. </strong></li>
                  <li>The       zwitterion reacts as an <strong>acid</strong> with a base by <strong>liberating a proton       (H+)</strong> from the NH3+  group and as       a result possesses a <strong>net negative       charge</strong>. </li>
                  <li>On       the other hand, zwitterions reacts with an acid <strong>as base</strong>, <strong>combining with       the proton (H+)</strong> of the acid resulting in the formation of a compound       having a <strong>net positive charge</strong>.       These reactions are reversible. </li>
                  <li>The <strong>pH </strong>at which the amino acid has       no tendency to move either towards positive or negative electrode is       called <strong>isoelectric pH or       isoelectric point</strong>. </li>
                  <li>At       isoelectric pH, the amino acid molecule bears a <strong>net charge of zero.</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Isomerism</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>All  amino acids except proline, found in protein are <strong>-amino  acids</strong> because NH2 group is attached to the -carbon atom, which is  next to the COOH group.</li>
            
                  <li>Examination  of the structure of amino acids reveals that <strong>except glycine</strong>, all other amino acids possess <strong>asymmetric carbon</strong> atom at the alpha position. </li>
                  <li>Because  of the presence of asymmetric carbon atom, amino acids exist in <strong>optically active forms</strong>.</li>
                  <li>For  example, in the steric configuration for serine, the carboxyl group is written  on the <strong>top</strong>, while the amino group is  written to the <strong>left</strong> in the case of L-serine  and to the right in the case of D-serine This distinction will hold good for  all the amino acids having asymmetric carbon atoms. </li>
                </ul>
                <p align="center"><img width="274" height="144" src="lec11_clip_image002.jpg" /></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>'D'  and 'L' do not refer to the optical rotation, but to the steric configuration  of amino group to the right and left side of the carboxyl group. </li>
                  <li>The <strong>direction of optical rotation</strong> of  amino acid is indicated by the symbol <strong>+  or -,</strong> which follows the designation 'D' or 'L'. </li>
                  <li>The  steric configuration and optical rotation of an amino acid may be  simultaneously expressed as D (+) or D (-) and L (+) or L (-). </li>
                  <li>L-forms  are more common than D-forms and most of the <strong>naturally occurring amino acids </strong>are<strong> L-amino acids.</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p align="center"><strong>Chemical properties</strong><br />
                    <strong>a)  Reactions due to amino group</strong><br />
                    <strong>Reaction  with formaldehyde (Formal titration)</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Amino  acid exists as zwitterion in aqueous medium. If an amino acid solution is  treated with excess of<strong> neutralized  formaldehyde solution</strong>, the amino group combines with formaldehyde forming <strong>dimethylol amino acid</strong> which is an amino  acid formaldehyde complex. </li>
                  <li>Hence  the <strong>amino group is protected</strong> and the  proton released is titrated against alkali. </li>
                  <li>This  method is used to find out the <strong>amount of  total free amino acids</strong> in plant samples.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Reaction with nitrous acid</strong><br />
                  Nitrous  acid reacts with the amino group of amino acids to form the corresponding  hydroxyacids and liberate nitrogen gas. </p>
                <p><strong>Reaction  with ninhydrin </strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Ninhydrin  is a <strong>strong oxidizing agent</strong>. </li>
                  <li>When  a solution of amino acid is boiled with ninhydrin, the amino acid is <strong>oxidatively deaminated</strong> to produce  ammonia and a ketoacid.</li>
                  <li>The <strong>keto acid</strong> is decarboxylated to  produce an <strong>aldehyde</strong> with one carbon  atom less than the parent amino acid. </li>
                  <li>The  net reaction is that ninhydrin oxidatively deaminates and decarboxylates -amino acids to CO2,  NH3 and an aldehyde. </li>
                  <li>The  reduced ninhydrin then reacts with the liberated ammonia and another molecule  of intact ninhydrin to produce a purple coloured compound known as <strong>Ruhemann's purple</strong>. </li>
                  <li>This  ninhydrin reaction is employed in the <strong>quantitative  determination of amino acids. </strong></li>
                  <li>Proteins  and peptides that have free amino group(s) (in the side chain) will also react  and give colour with ninhydrin.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>b)  Reactions due to carboxyl group</strong><br />
                    <strong>Decarboxylation</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The  carboxyl group of amino acids is <strong>decarboxylated</strong> to yield the corresponding <strong>amines.</strong> Thus, the vasoconstrictor agent, <strong>histamine</strong> is produced from histidine.</li>
                  <li>Histamine  stimulates the <strong>flow of gastric juice  into the stomach</strong> and the <strong>dilation  and constriction of specific blood vessels. </strong></li>
                  <li>Excess  reaction to histamine causes the <strong>symptoms  of asthma</strong> and various <strong>allergic  reactions.</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Essential amino acids</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Most  of the prokaryotic and many eukaryotic organisms (plants) are capable of  synthesizing all the amino acids present in the protein. But higher animals including  man possess this ability only for certain amino acids. </li>
                  <li>The  amino acids, which are needed for normal functioning of the body<strong> </strong>but<strong> cannot be synthesized from metabolic intermediates, </strong>are called<strong> essential amino acids</strong>. </li>
                  <li>These  must be obtained from the <strong>diet</strong> and a  deficiency in any one of the amino acids prevents growth and may even cause  death.</li>
                  <li><strong>Methionine, Arginine,  Threonine, Tryptophan, Valine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Phenylalanine, Histidine,  and Lysine are the essential amino acids</strong> (Remember <strong>MATTVILPHLy</strong>).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Peptide</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Amino  acids are linked together by formation of <strong>covalent  bonds.</strong> </li>
                  <li>The  covalent bond is formed between the <strong>-carboxyl group of one  amino acid and the -amino group of the next amino acid. </strong></li>
                  <li>The  bond so formed between the carboxyl and the amino groups, after elimination of  a water molecule is called as a <strong>peptide  bond</strong> and the compound formed is a <strong>peptide.</strong></li>
                  <li> The peptide formed between two amino acids is  a dipeptide; three amino acids is a tripeptide; few amino acids are an  oligopeptide and many amino acids is a polypeptide. </li>
                  <li>In  writing the peptide structure, the amino terminal (N-terminal) amino acid is  written first and carboxyl terminal (C-terminal) amino acid written last.</li>
                </ul>
                <p align="center"><img width="498" height="150" src="lec11_clip_image004.jpg" /><br />
                    <strong>Peptides  of physiological interest</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Glutathione</strong> is a commonly occurring tripeptide <strong>(-glutamyl  cysteinyl glycine</strong>) in many  living organisms.</li>
                </ul>
                <p align="center">
                    <img width="374" height="166" src="lec11_clip_image006.jpg" /></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>It  has a role in <strong>detoxification of toxic  compounds</strong> in physiological system.</li>
                  <li>The  nanapeptides (nine amino acids), oxytocin and vasopressin are important animal  peptide hormones. </li>
                  <li><strong>Oxytocin</strong> induces labor in pregnant women and controls contraction of uterine muscle. </li>
                  <li><strong>Vasopressin</strong> plays a role in control of blood pressure by regulating the contraction of  smooth muscles.</li>
                  <li>A  dipeptide <strong>L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine</strong>,  is of commercial importance. This dipeptide is about 200 times sweeter than  cane sugar. The methyl ester of this dipeptide is called as <strong>aspartame</strong> and marketed as an artificial  sweetener for <strong>diabetics.</strong></li>
                </ul>
