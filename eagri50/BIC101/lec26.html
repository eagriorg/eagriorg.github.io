				<p>Fatty acids obtained by hydrolysis of fats undergo  different oxidative pathways designated as    alpha (),  beta  ()  and omega  (w)  pathways.<br />
                    <strong>Oxidation</strong> </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>a-Oxidation  of fatty acids has been found in  certain  tissues especially in <strong>brain tissue of  mammals and  plant  systems.</strong> </li>
				  <li> It does not require CoA intermediates and no  high‑energy phosphates are generated. </li>
				  <li> This type of oxidation results in the <strong>removal of one carbon</strong> at a time from  the <strong>carboxyl end of the fatty acid</strong>.</li>
				  <li>  The physiological role of ‑oxidation  in plants is not yet fully established but it has been suggested that it may be <strong>involved in the degradation of long  chain fatty acids </strong>as observed in many animal tissues. </li>
				  <li> ‑Oxidation  is clearly the <strong>main source of the odd‑carbon  fatty acids</strong> and their derivatives that occur in some plant lipids. </li>
				  <li> In this process, sequential removal of one  carbon at a time from free fatty acids of chain length ranging from C13 to C18 occur. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>-Oxidation </strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Oxidation  is normally a very minor pathway brought about by <strong>hydroxylase enzymes</strong> involving <strong>cytochrome  P‑450</strong> in the <strong>endoplasmic reticulum.</strong>  </li>
				  <li>Fatty  acids with oxygen function  (alcoholic or  carboxyl) at the methyl terminal end (‑end)  are formed by ‑oxidation  and frequently occur as constituents of <strong>cutin  and suberin. </strong></li>
				  <li>The  requirements for the oxygenase‑mediated conversion of a ‑methyl  fatty acyl CoA into a w‑hydroxymethyl  fatty acyl CoA are <strong>molecular oxygen,</strong> reduced pyridine nucleotide and <strong>a  non-heme iron protein</strong> in higher plants.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Oxidation  of fatty acids </strong><br />
			    In 1904, Franz Knoop made a critical contribution to the  elucidation of the mechanism of fatty acid oxidation and demonstrated that most  of the fatty acids are degraded by oxidation at the <strong>‑carbon. </strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li> ‑Oxidation  of fatty acids takes place in <strong>mitochondria.</strong> </li>
				  <li> Fatty acids are activated before they enter  into mitochondria for oxidation. </li>
			    </ul>
				<h2>Activation  of fatty acids </h2>
				<ul>
				  <li>Fatty  acids are converted into active intermediate in a reaction with <strong>ATP and coenzyme A. </strong></li>
				  <li>A <strong>thioester linkage</strong> between the  carboxyl group of a fatty acid and the sulfhydryl group of coenzyme A is formed  with the hydrolysis of ATP. </li>
				  <li> This activation reaction  takes place on the <strong>outer mitochondrial membrane</strong> catalysed by <strong>acyl  CoA synthetase</strong>. </li>
				  <li>Several <strong>acyl CoA synthetases</strong> each specific  for fatty acids of different chain length are present in the membrane of  mitochondria. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Penetration  of long chain fatty acids into mitochondria</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Long  chain acyl‑CoA molecules do not readily get into the inner mitochondrial  membrane and are carried across the inner membrane by conjugating with <strong>carnitine </strong>(‑hydroxy  ‑trimethyl  ammonium butyrate), a zwitterionic compound formed from lysine.   </li>
				  <li>Activation  of lower fatty acids and their oxidation within the mitochondria occur  independently of carnitine, but long‑chain acyl CoA will become oxidised unless  they form acylcarnitines.   </li>
				  <li>The  acyl CoA combines with carnitine in the presence of <strong>carnitine acyltransferase I,</strong> which is bound to the outer  mitochondrial membrane. </li>
				  <li><strong> Acylcarnitine</strong> is  transported in, coupled with the transport out of one molecule of  carnitine.  </li>
				  <li>The  acylcarnitine then reacts with coenzyme A catalyzed by <strong>carnitine palmitoyl transferase II,</strong> located on the inside of the  inner membrane.  </li>
				  <li> Acyl CoA is reformed in the mitochondrial  matrix and carnitine is liberated. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Oxidation </strong><br />
				  A saturated acyl CoA is oxidised by a <strong>recurring sequence of four reactions</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Oxidation  in presence of FAD, hydration, oxidation in presence of NAD+, and  thiolysis by CoASH.  </li>
				  <li>In  ‑oxidation, <strong>2 carbons are cleaved</strong> at a time from  acyl CoA molecules, starting from the carboxyl end.  </li>
				  <li>The  chain is <strong>broken</strong> between the <strong>a</strong><strong>-and </strong><strong>b</strong>-carbon  atoms. </li>
				  <li> The two‑carbon units formed are acetyl CoA. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>i) The first reaction in ‑oxidation  of acyl CoA is the formation of <em>trans</em> 2- enoyl CoA  or , ‑unsaturated  acyl CoA in presence of acyl‑CoA dehydrogenase and the coenzyme, FAD. <br />
				  ii) The next step is the <strong>hydration of the double bond</strong> between C‑2  and C‑3 by enoyl CoA hydratase with the formation of ‑hydroxy  acyl CoA. <br />
				  iii) In the third step, the ‑hydroxy  acyl CoA is <strong>dehydrogenated </strong>in the  presence of <br />
				  <strong>‑hydroxy  acyl CoA dehydrogenase </strong>and NAD+ forming ‑ketoacyl  CoA. <br />
				  iv) In the last step of ‑oxidation,  ‑ketoacyl  CoA reacts with coenzyme A in the presence of the enzyme, <strong>thiolase.</strong>  <br />
				  The products of this  reaction are acetyl CoA and an acyl CoA containing <strong>two carbons less than the original acyl CoA molecule</strong> that underwent  oxidation. <br />
				  By the above steps of ‑oxidation  fatty acids are completely degraded to acetyl  CoA units. The acetyl CoA formed from fatty acids can be oxidised to carbon  dioxide and water via citric acid cycle.  <br />
  <strong>Energetics  of  </strong><strong> oxidation </strong><br />
				  The energetics or the energy conserved in terms of ATP by  oxidation of a molecule of palmitic acid is given below: </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Palmitic  acid (16 carbons) undergoes -oxidation  forming eight molecules of acetyl CoA by undergoing <strong>seven </strong><strong>‑oxidation  spirals.</strong>  </li>
				  <li>When  one cycle of ‑oxidation  takes place, one molecule of FADH2, one molecule of NADH and one molecule of  acetyl CoA are produced. </li>
				  <li>Electrons  from these reducing equivalents (FADH2 and NADH) are transported through the <strong>respiratory chain in mitochondria</strong> with  simultaneous regeneration of high-energy phosphate bonds.</li>
				  <li> Mitochondrial oxidation of FADH2  eventually results in the net formation of  about 1.5 ATP.  </li>
				  <li>Likewise,  oxidation of electrons from NADH yields 2.5 molecules of ATP.  Hence, a total of <strong>four ATP molecules</strong> are formed per cycle and <strong>ten molecules of ATP</strong> are formed through Krebs’s cycle from each  molecule of acetyl CoA.  </li>
			    </ul>
				<div><br />
				  8 Acetyl CoA through TCA cycle  yield  (8x10)          =  80 ATP <br />
				  7  ‑oxidation  spiral reactions yield (7x4)                  = 28 ATP                                                                                            <br />
				  --------------<br />
				  Total                 <strong>108 ATP</strong><br />
				  -------------                          <br />
				  ATP utilized in the initial  step         = 2 ATP <br />
				  Hence, <strong> complete oxidation of palmitic acid</strong> yields <strong>106 ATP.   </strong> </div>
				<p><strong>Oxidation of monounsaturated fatty acids </strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Oxidation  of monounsaturated fatty acids follows many of the reactions of saturated fatty  acids except the requirement of <strong>two  additional enzymes, an isomerase and a novel reductase.  </strong></li>
				  <li>Reactions  of monounsaturated fatty acid are explained by considering   the oxidation of a C-16 unsaturated fatty  acid, palmitoleic acid, having a single double bond between C-9 and C-10 . </li>
				  <li>Palmitoleic  acid is activated and transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane in  the same way as saturated fatty acids. </li>
				  <li> Palmitoleoyl CoA undergoes three cycles of  degradation as in   oxidation.  But the <em>cis</em> 3  decenoyl CoA formed after the third cycle  does not serve as a substrate for acyl CoA dehydrogenase.  </li>
				  <li>The  presence of a double bond between C-3 and C-4 prevents the formation of another  double bond between C-2 and C-3. </li>
				  <li><strong>An isomerase</strong> converts the <em>cis</em> double bond into a <em>trans</em> double bond and shifts  the position of double bond   between C-2  and C-3. </li>
				  <li>The  subsequent or follow up reactions are those of the   oxidation pathway in which the <em>trans</em> 2 decenoyl CoA is a regular substrate. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Oxidation of polyunsaturated  fatty acids </strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The oxidation of a polyunsaturated fatty acid,  linoleic acid, with <em>cis</em>‑9  and <em>cis</em>-12 double bonds, is considered. </li>
				  <li>The <em>cis</em>-3 double bond formed after three rounds of ‑oxidation is converted into a  trans double bond by the isomerase.  </li>
				  <li>This permits one more round of ‑oxidation. </li>
				  <li>The acyl CoA produced by four  rounds of -oxidation of linoleic acid contains  a <em>cis</em>-4 double bond, which undergoes dehydrogenation  by acyl CoA dehydrogenase yielding <em>trans</em> 2, <em>cis</em>-4   dienoyl  intermediate.This intermediate is not a  substrate for the next enzyme in the ‑oxidation pathway.  </li>
				  <li>This intermediate is converted  into a <em>trans</em> 3 enoyl CoA to the trans 2 form, an intermediate generally found in -oxidation pathway and results in  complete oxidation of the fatty acid. </li>
			    </ul>
