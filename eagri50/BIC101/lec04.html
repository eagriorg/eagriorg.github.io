				<p><strong>Deterioration of Genetic  Purity</strong><br />
The genetic purity  of a variety or trueness to its type deteriorates due to several factors during  the production cycles. Kadam (1942) listed the following important factors  responsible for deterioration of varieties.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Developmental variations</li>
				  <li>Mechanical mixtures</li>
				  <li>Mutations</li>
				  <li>Natural crossing</li>
				  <li>Minor genetic variations</li>
				  <li>Selected influence of  pest and diseases</li>
				  <li>The techniques of the  plant breeder</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>1. Developmental Variations</strong><br />
				  When seed crops are grown under  environments with differing soil fertility, climate, photoperiods, or at  different elevations for several consecutive generation's developmental  variations may set in as differential growth responses. <br />
				  It is therefore, preferred to grow the  varieties of crops in the areas of their natural adaptation to minimize  developmental shifts.<br />
  <strong>2. Mechanical Mixtures</strong><br />
  <strong>          </strong>Mechanical  mixtures, the most important reason for varietal deterioration, often take  place at the time of sowing if more than one variety is sown with the same seed  drill, through volunteer plants of the same crop in the seed field, or through  different varieties grown in adjacent fields.   Two varieties growing next to each other field is usually mixed during  harvesting and threshing operations.  The  threshing equipment is often contaminated with seeds of other varieties.  Similarly, the gunny bags, seed bins and elevators are also often contaminate,  adding to the mechanical mixtures of varieties.  <br />
				  Roguing the seed fields critically and  using utmost care during seed production and processing are necessary to avoid  such mechanical contamination.<br />
  <strong>3. Mutations</strong><br />
  <strong>          </strong>Mutations  do not seriously deteriorate varieties. It is often difficult to identify or  detect minor mutations occurring naturally.   Mutants such as, 'fatuoids' in oats or 'rabbit ear' in peas may be  removed by roguing from seed plots to purify the seeds.<br />
  <strong>4. Natural Crossing</strong><br />
				  Natural crossing can be an important  source of varietal deterioration in sexually propagated crops.  The extent of contamination depends upon the  magnitude of natural cross-fertilization.   The deterioration sets in due to natural crossing with undesirable  types, diseased plants or off types. In self-fertilized crops, natural crossing  is not a serious source of contamination unless variety is male sterile and is  grown in close proximity with other varieties.   The natural crossing, however, can be major source of contamination due  to natural crossing are the breeding system of the species, isolation distance,  varietal mass and pollinating agent.  The  direction of prevailing winds, the numbers of insects present and their  activity and mass of varieties are also important considerations in  contamination by natural crossing.<br />
				  The isolation of seed crops is the most  important factor in avoiding contamination of the cross-fertilized crops.  <br />
  <strong>5. Minor Genetic Variations</strong><br />
  <strong>          </strong>Minor  genetic variations can occur even in varieties appearing phenotypically uniform  and homogenous when released.  The  variations may lost during later production cycles owing to selective  elimination by the nature.    The yield  trials of lines propagated from plants of breeder's seed to maintain the purity  of self-pollinated crop varieties can overcome these minor variations.  Due care during the maintenance of nucleus  and breeder's seed of cross-fertilized varieties of crop is necessary.</p>
				<p><strong>6. Selected Influence of  Pest and Diseases</strong><br />
                    <strong>          </strong> New crop varieties often are susceptible to  newer races of pests and diseases caused by obligate parasites and thus  selectively influence deterioration.  The  vegetatively propagated stock also can deteriorate quickly if infected by  virus, fungi or bacteria.  Seed  production under strict disease free conditions is therefore essential.<br />
                    <strong>7. The Techniques of the  Plant Breeder: </strong><br />
                    <strong>          </strong>Serious instabilities may  occur in varieties owing to cytogenetic irregularities in the form of improper  assessments in the release of new varieties.   Premature release of varieties, still segregating for resistance and  susceptibility to diseases or other factors can cause significant deterioration  of varieties.  This failure can be  attributed to the variety testing programme. <br />
				  In addition to these factors, other  heritable variations due to recombination's and polyploidisation may also take  place in varieties during seed production, which can be avoided by periodical  selection during maintenance of the seed stock.<br />
  <strong> Maintenance of Genetic Purity during seed  Production</strong><br />
				  The various steps  suggested, to <strong>maintain varietal purity</strong>,  are as follows. </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Use of approved seed only  in seed multiplication.</li>
				  <li>Inspection and approval of  fields prior to planting.</li>
				  <li>Field inspection and  approval of growing crops at critical stages for verification of genetic  purity, detection of mixtures, weeds, and for freedom from noxious weeds and  seed borne diseases etc.</li>
				  <li>Sampling and sealing of  cleaned lots</li>
				  <li>Growing of samples of  potentially approved stocks for comparison with authentic stocks.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>The  various steps suggested for <strong>maintaining  genetic purity</strong> are as follows: </p>
				<ol start="1" type="a">
                  <li>Providing adequate isolation to       prevent contamination by natural crossing or mechanical mixtures </li>
				  <li>Rouging of seed fields prior to the       stage at which they could contaminate the seed crop. </li>
				  <li>Periodic testing of varieties for       genetic purity. </li>
				  <li>Avoiding genetic shifts by growing       crops in areas in their adaptation only. </li>
				  <li>Certification of seed crops to       maintain genetic purity and quality of seed. </li>
				  <li>Adopting the generation system. </li>
				  <li>Grow out tests. </li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Genetic Purity Maintenance in <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_seed">Hybrid</a> Seeds</u></strong><strong> </strong><br />
				  Maintenance  of the genetic purity of hybrid seeds is a complicated one requiring elaborate  procedures.</p>
				<p><strong>Nucleus  Seed of <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbred_line">Inbred</a> Lines</u></strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The  nucleus seed of inbred lines can be maintained by self pollination,  sib-pollination, or a combination of the two procedures (hand pollination).</li>
				  <li>Some  breeders prefer 'sibbing&quot; because it maintains vigour. &quot;<a href="http://en.mimi.hu/biology/selfing.html">Selfing</a>&quot; is used to  stabilize inbred lines if a change in breeding behavior is noticed.</li>
				  <li>Some  parental material is preferably maintained by alternate selfing and  sibbing  from one generation to other.</li>
				  <li>Individually  selfed or sibbed ears should be examined critically, discarding off types or  inferior characteristics (texture, colour, seed size, chaff color and shape  of  earhead).</li>
				  <li>The  uniform ears are then threshed separately and planted in ear to row method  to easily detect and discard off types from  individual ears if any.</li>
				  <li>Alternatively  all of the ears from an individual inbred line may be composited for  bulk planting in the next season.</li>
				  <li>The  hand pollination seed is sown on clean, fertile soil having no previous crop  of   the same kind or variety during the  previous year (bearing maize).</li>
				  <li>It  is rather important to ensure that the crop is well isolated, with the  requirement varying from crop to crop and depending upon the nature of the  material to be protected by isolation, the nature of the contaminant, and the  direction of the prevailing wind.</li>
				  <li>The  isolation can be achieved either by distance or by time (maize). The inbred  line may be composited for bulk planting in the next season.</li>
				  <li>Maintenance  of genetic purity in inbred lines through hand pollination and adequate  isolation alone is not enough to achieve perfection.</li>
				  <li>The  isolated fields must be critically rogued for off types and other impure types  prior to the shedding of pollen.</li>
				  <li>The  nucleus seed crop is harvested after physiological maturity if artificial  drying facilities exist.</li>
				  <li>Ear  to harvest lines are harvested separately and piled; These are again critically  examined for ear characteristics, sorting out of all off-coloured, diseased, or  otherwise undesirable ears.</li>
				  <li>If  the overall percentage of off types exceeds 0.1%, hand pollination should  be  repeated to produce the second year's  breeders seed.</li>
				  <li>The  uniform ears are bulked, dried in a clean dry bin at temperatures not exceeding  430C, shelled, cleaned, treated with pesticides, and stored under  ideal storage conditions as breeder stock seed. This seed may be increased  during the following season by paying adequate attention to isolation, roguing,  etc., to maintain high genetic purity of the seed.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong> Nucleus Seed of Non-Inbred Lines</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>To  maintain in the genetic purity of the nucleus seed of non-inbred lines, the  number of plants for hand pollination should be large enough to preserve  genetic make up of the variety, narrowing the genetic base by sibbing only a  few plants (about 5000 plants or more).</li>
				  <li>The  sibbed ears are examined critically, discarding of colour, texture, or diseased  ones.</li>
				  <li>Uniform  ears are bulked, dried, shelled, cleaned, treated and stored as usual.</li>

				  <li>Other  practices of seeding sibbed nucleus seeds are similar to those described  earlier for inbred lines.</li>
				  <li>Roguing  however, needs to be observed more critically by individuals with good  knowledge of the material.</li>
				  <li>The  breeder's stock seed thus produced from the nucleus seed can be utilized to  increase the breeder's stock of non-inbred lines, paying adequate attention to  land requirements, isolation, roguing, harvesting and handling of seed to  achieve maximum genetic purity.</li>
				  <li>The  breeder's seed of the established varieties of cross-pollinated crops can be  maintained by raising breeder's seed crop in isolation and roguing the crop  thoroughly at various stages.</li>
				  <li>It  is often purified by mass selection.</li>
				  <li>The  crop is grown in isolation and rogued carefully as described earlier. </li>
				  <li>At  maturity about 20,000 - 25000 true to type plants are selected, harvested  separately, and bulked after careful examination.</li>
				  <li>This  constitutes the breeder's stock seed. The seed may be carried over to ensure against  possible failures or unforeseen shortages</li>
