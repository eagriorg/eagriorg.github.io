				<p>Putting together an ideal  machinery system is not easy. Equipment that works best one year may not work  well the next because of changes in weather conditions or crop production  practices. Improvements in design may make older equipment obsolete. And, the number  of acres being farmed or the amount of labor available may change. Because many  of these variables are unpredictable, the goal of the good machinery manager  should be to have a system that is flexible enough to adapt to a range of weather  and crop conditions while minimizing long-run costs and production risks<br />
                  <strong>POINTS  TO BE CONSIDERED IN SELECTING A FARM MACHINERY</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>To do better farm  machinery selection, the following fundamental things must be understood<br />
                  <strong>1. Machine Performance</strong><br />
Each piece of machinery must  perform reliably under a variety of field conditions or it is a poor investment  regardless of its cost. Tillage implements should prepare a satisfactory seedbed  while conserving moisture, destroying early weed growth and minimizing erosion  potential. Planters and seeders<br />
should provide consistent seed placement and  population as well as properly apply pesticides and fertilizers. Harvesting equipment  must harvest clean, undamaged grain while minimizing field losses. The  performance of a machine often depends on the skill of the operator, or on  weather and soil conditions. Nevertheless, differences among machines can be  evaluated through field trials, research reports and personal experience.<br />
<strong>2. Machinery Costs</strong><br />
Once a particular type of  tillage, planting, weed control, or harvesting machine has been selected, the  question of how to minimize machinery costs must be answered. Machinery that is  too large for a particular farming situation will cause machinery ownership  costs to be unnecessarily high over the long run; machinery that is too small  may result in lower crop yields or reduced quality.<br />
<strong>3. Ownership Costs</strong><br />
Machinery ownership costs  include charges for deprecation, interest on investment, property taxes,  insurance and machinery housing. These costs increase in direct proportion to  machinery investment and size.</p>
                <p><strong>4. Operating Costs</strong><br />
                  Operating costs include  fuel, lubricants and repairs. Operating costs per acre change very little as  machinery size is increased or decreased. Using larger machinery consumes more  fuel and lubricants per hour, but this is essentially<br />
                  offset by the fact that more acres are  covered per hour. Much the same is true of repair costs. Thus, operating costs  are of minor importance when deciding what size machinery is best suited to a  certain farming operation<br />
  <strong>5. Labor Cost</strong><br />
                  As machinery capacity  increases, the number of hours required to complete field operations over a  given area naturally declines. <br />
  <strong>6.</strong><strong>Estimating the Field  Capacity of Farm Machines </strong> <br />
                  If hourly or part-time hired  labor operates machinery, it is appropriate to use the wage rate paid, plus the  cost of any other benefits which may be provided, as the labor cost. If the  farmer-owner or a hired worker who is paid a fixed wage operates machinery,  then it is proper to value labor at its opportunity cost, or the estimated  return it could earn if it were used elsewhere in the farm business, such as in  livestock enterprises.<br />
  <strong>7. Timeliness Costs</strong><br />
                  In many cases, crop yields  and quality are affected by the dates of planting and harvesting. This  represents a &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; cost associated with farm machinery, but an important one  nevertheless. The value of these yield losses is commonly referred to as  &ldquo;timeliness costs.&rdquo; <br />
  <strong>8. Total Machinery Costs</strong><br />
                  Illustrates  the effect that changes in machinery size have on each type of cost in a  typical situation. For very small machinery (relative to crop acres), a slight increase  in machinery size can lower timeliness and labor costs significantly, enough to  more than offset the higher fixed costs. However, as machinery size continues  to increase, the timeliness cost savings diminish, and eventually total costs  begin to rise. One objective of machinery selection, then, is to select  machinery in the size range where total machinery costs are lowest.<br />

                <p><strong>FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE SIZE OF MACHINERY  NEEDED</strong><br />
                  Machinery recommendations  must be based on the characteristics of each individual farm. The following  factors influence machinery selection, and are discussed in order of  importance.<br />
  <strong>1. Number of Crop Acres</strong><br />
                  As more crop acres are  farmed, larger-scale machinery is needed to ensure that planting and harvesting  are completed in a timely fashion. An alternative is to acquire a second unit  of some machines, if an additional tractor and operator are available.<br />
  <strong>2. Labor Supply</strong><br />
                  The number of acres that can  be completed each day is the most critical measure of machinery capacity, more  than machine width or acres completed per hour. Increasing the labor supply by  hiring extra operators or by working longer hours during critical periods may  be a relatively inexpensive way of stretching machinery capacity. In addition,  the cost of additional labor only needs to be incurred in those years in which  it is actually used, while the cost of investing in larger machinery becomes  &ldquo;locked in&rdquo; as soon as the investment is made. On the other hand, extra labor  may not always be available when needed, and working long hours over several  days can present a safety hazard. </p>
                <p><strong>3. Tillage Practices</strong><br />
                  The  number of field days needed before planting is completed depends partly on the  number of separate operations completed on each acre. Reducing the number of tillage  practices performed or performing more than one practice in the same trip  effectively decreases the amount of machinery capacity needed to complete field  operations on time. Of course, machinery cost savings from reduced tillage must  be compared to possible increased chemical costs and effects on yields.</p>
                <p>Putting together an ideal  machinery system is not easy. Equipment that works best one year may not work  well the next because of changes in weather conditions or crop production  practices. Improvements in design may make older equipment obsolete. And, the number  of acres being farmed or the amount of labor available may change.

                <h2><strong>ESTIMATING  POWER REQUIREMENTS</strong></h2>
                <h3>Estimation  of draft</h3>
                <p>            In order to determine the draft requirement  of an implement it is necessary to use a pull meter. Estimation of likely draft  requirements can be taken from the table provided. However, these values will  vary according to soil type, soil moisture, depth of working, ground speed and  manufacturer.</p>
                <p><strong>Table  3 Estimating Draft Requirements</strong></p>
                <table width="50%" border="1" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
                  <tr>
                    <td valign="top"><p><strong>Implement</strong></p></td>
                    <td align="center" valign="top"><p><strong>Draft    per Unit Width (kN/m)</strong></p></td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td valign="top"><p>Chisel plough<br />
                      Blade plough<br />
                      Disc plough<br />
                      Scarifier<br />
                      Cultivator<br />
                      Planter</p></td>
                    <td align="center" valign="top"><p>4.5-5.5<br />
                      4.0-4.5<br />
                      5.0-6.0<br />
                      4.0-4.5<br />
                      3.0-3.5<br />
                      2.5-3.5</p></td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
                <p>A  figure for total draft can be calculated by simply multiplying implement width  by draft per unit width. Considering the example using the chisel plough, then:<br />
                  Total  draft                    = width (m) x  draft / metre (kN/m)<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                   = 7.8 x 5<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                   = 39 kN ( approx. 3900 kgf)<br />
                  If a scarifier was used to replace  the chisel plough, the draft per unit width would decrease to 4.5 kN/m and the  resultant total draft would be 35 kN (3500 kgf). Remember this is draft or  pull, not drawbar power.</p>
                <h3>Estimation  of drawbar power</h3>
                <p>Drawbar  power can be related to draft and speed, by using the formula below. Any one  drawbar power level may be attained by a combination of pull and speed. That  is, a large pull at a low speed could produce the same drawbar power as a small  pull at high speed.<br />
                  Drawbar  power           =          <u>pull (kN) x speed* (km/hr)</u><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                        3.6 (constant)<br />
                  Using  the same chisel plough as in the previous example, the power requirements  become:<br />
                  Drawbar  power           =       <u>39 x 8</u><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             3.6<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=  87 kW (116hp).<br />
                  *Speed  has been determined by the initial assumption when working out the required  implement width.<br />
                  Note:  Kilowatts (kW) x 1.34    = Horsepower (hp)<br />
                  Horsepower (hp) x 0.746        = Kilowatts  (kW)<br />
  <strong>            At  this point, it would pay to work through all of the tillage operations and  determine the requirements for each, after closely considering the time  available and field efficiency. The largest power requirement would be then  used in determining engine power.</strong></p>
                <h3>Estimating  engine power</h3>
                <p>            Once drawbar power has been  calculated, a decision needs to be made about what type of tractor is to be  used.<br />
                  The selection decision between  wheels or tracks is far too complex a topic to be covered in this chapter.  Suffice to say that if set-up and matched correctly, the operating costs should  be similar for either tractive type. The decision between two wheel drive and  four wheel drive is much simpler as it is determined by the minimum available  size of a 4WD and the maximum size of a 2WD (that is approximately 150 kW or  200 hp).<br />
                  From Table 2, it is now possible to  determine the size of tractor required. In using the comparative chart it would  be unwise to determine engine size using the maximum power figure as conditions  vary both from season to season and even within any one season. Having a little  extra capacity is also a safeguard against overloading. A more realistic figure  is the normal operation level.</p>

                <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
                <p>            If a step by step approach is used  when matching power units and implements, it is possible to eliminate the  majority of guess work that is normally employed when a machinery purchase  decision is made.<br />
                  This approach is simplistic but does  allow changes to any of the inputs. Care must be taken not to over estimate  either the time available to complete the task or field efficiency.</p>
