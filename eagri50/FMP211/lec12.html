				<p>Sprayer  is a machine used to apply liquid chemicals on plants to control pest and  diseases. It can also be used to apply herbicides to control weeds and to spray  micro-nutrients to enhance plant growth</p>
                <p><strong>The main functions of a sprayer  are</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Breaking  the chemical solution in to fine droplets of effective size.</li>
                  <li>Distributing  the droplets uniformly over the plants.</li>
                  <li>Applying  the chemicals with sufficient pressure for positive reaching the plants</li>
                  <li>Regulating  the amount of liquid applied on plants to avoid excessive application.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Desirable quality of a sprayer
                </strong></p>
                     A good sprayer should posses the  following qualities</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>It  should produce a steady stream of spray material in desired droplet size so  that the plants to be treated may be covered uniformly.</li>
                  <li>It  should deliver the liquid at sufficient pressure so that the spray solution  reaches all the foliage and spreads uniformly over the plant body.</li>
                  <li>It  should be light in weight yet sufficiently strong, easily workable and  repairable.<strong></strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>BASIC  COMPONENTS OF A SPRAYER</strong><br />
Components of a sprayer are as follows</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Pump  b) Chemical tank c) agitator d) Air chamber e) pressure gauge f) Pressure  regulator g) valves h) Strainer i) suction line j) delivery line k) nozzles</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Pump :</strong> A  pump is a device used to move fluids, such as liquids or slurries, or gases  from one place to another. A pump displaces a volume by physical or mechanical  action. Most hydraulic sprayers are equipped with positive displacement pumps  capable of developing pressure, required for many spraying jobs. The discharge  capacity of these pumps is approximately proportional to the speed. A pressure  relief valve or by-pass valve is required to protect these positive acting  pumps from damage when the discharge line is closed and for the convenience of  the operator.<br />
                  <strong>Tank:</strong> It  is the container to hold the chemical solution. It is made up of PVC, Brass,  etc. It is usually made of metal sheet or synthetic rubber or plastic having  good resistant quality against corrosion, erosion, and similar actions. The  size of the tank varies according to the pump capacity and the requirements.<br />
                  <strong>Agitator:</strong> It  is the device which stirs the solution and keep the contents in homogenous  condition. Positive agitation of spray material in the tank is essential to  permit using the full range of spray materials including powdery emulsions,  fungicides, cold water paints or other spray material. The propeller or paddle  type mechanical agitators or hydraulic agitators are very common. <br />
                  <strong>Air chamber:</strong> In  a reciprocating type pump, an air chamber is provided on the discharge line of  the pump to level out the pulsations of the pump and thus providing a constant  nozzle pressure<br />
                  <strong>Pressure gauge:</strong> It  is a dial gauge which indicates the pressure at which the liquid is delivered  from the pump.. A pressure gauge properly calibrated, within the pressure range  of the pump is provided on the discharge line to guide the operator for making  proper adjustment of the pressure at site.<br />
                  <strong>Pressure regulator:</strong> The  pressure regulator serves several important functions. It is the means of  adjusting the pressure as required for any spray job with in the pressure range  of the pump. With the positive displacement type of pump, it also serves as a  safety device in automatically unloading the excess pressure by directing the  unused discharge flow from pump back to the tank.<br />
                  <strong>Valves:</strong> A  valve is a device that regulates the flow of a fluid (gases, liquids, fluidized  solids, or slurries) by opening, closing, or partially obstructing various  passageways. <br />
                  <strong>Cut-off valve</strong> is  provided in the delivery line to control the flow from the pump,<br />
                  <strong>By-pass valve</strong> is  provided in the delivery line to by-pass the flow from pump to tank when flow  in delivery line is reduced than the pump capacity <br />
                  <strong>Relief valve - </strong>It is an automatic device to control the  pressure of fluid or gas within a range a predetermined pressure.<br />
                  <strong>Strainer :</strong> It  is a<strong> </strong>small circular plastic ring  with nylon wire mesh to filter any dust particle coming with the chemical  solution  It is  included in the suction line between the chemical  tank and the check valves. In some sprayers strainers are provided at the mouth  of the chemical tank. Eg. Knapsack sprayers<br />
                  <strong>Nozzles :</strong> It  is the component which breaks the fluid in to fine droplet . Automation of  spray fluid is usually achieved by discharging the liquid through an orifice  called nozzle under pressure. Atomization is also achieved by breaking up the  jet of liquid with a blast of air. <br />
                  <strong>Spray gun -</strong>    It is a hand held metallic of PVC pipe to one  end of which the nozzle is fitted and a flow cut off valve and a handle are  fitted at the other end. The delivery hose is connected to the spray gun. It  conducts the fluid from the delivery hose to the nozzle. The operator holds the  gun and does the spraying job. Area of coverage by a spray gun is less compared  to the coverage of a spray boom. Spray guns are used with low power sprayers E.g.  Knapsack sprayers, rocker sprayer<br />
                  <strong>Spray boom -</strong> It  is a long metallic or PVC pipe to which several nozzles are fitted with. The  delivery hose is connected to the spray gun. High power and high capacity  sprayers use spray booms. The coverage is larger compared to spray guns. Booms  are usually mounted on suitable structures and used.  E.g. Tractor operated sprayers, power tiller  operated sprayers<br />
                  <strong>Over-flow pipe -</strong> It  is a conduit pipe through which excess fluid from a pump is by-passed in to  chemical tank by the action of a relief valve or pressure regulator. </p>
                <p><strong>COMPONENTS A OF NOZZLE</strong><br />
                  <strong>Nozzle body</strong> -  It is the main component which encloses all other components of a nozzle <br />
                  <strong>Swirl plate -</strong>   It is metal disc with two tangential holes  which imparts a swirl or rotation to the  liquid passing through it <br />
                  <strong>Nozzle disc -</strong>  It is the component which breaks the fluid in  to fine droplet. It is a flat disc with an  orifice at the centre. When the spray solution reaches the disc from the swirl  plate the disc  builds up further  pressure on the fluid and when the fluid passes out of the orifice, it breaks  in to fine droplets . The disc has a specific design to impart a hollow cone or  solid cone or a flat fan type of discharge to the outgoing fluid. <br />
                  The  popular nozzles are a) hollow cone b) solid cone c) fan or flat type <br />
  <strong>Strainer- </strong>It  is a<strong> </strong>small circular plastic ring  with nylon wire mesh to filter any dust particle coming with the chemical  solution</p>
                <p>Spacer: There are two number of runner/ plastic rings placed in between  nozzle plate and swirl plate and between swirl plate and strainer for effective  travel of the solution</p>
                <p><strong>TYPES OF SPRAYERS</strong></p>
                <p><strong>            </strong>Based  up on the volume of<strong> </strong>liquid handled ,sprayers  may be  classified in to </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>High  volume sprayer (more than 400 litres /ha)</li>
                  <li>Low volume  sprayer (5 to 400 litres/ hectare)</li>
                  <li>Ultra  low volume sprayer (ULV) spray (less than 5 litres /ha).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>            The selection technique depends up on  type of vegetation, kind of pests and approach to the field.</p>
                <p><strong>ULTRA LOW VOLUME SPRAYER</strong></p>
                <p>            ULV Sprayer is used to spray  chemicals on row crops like cotton, cowpea, groundnuts ,  tobacco and vegetables. It is ideally suited  for home gardens.  It is a hand-held sprayer  with a spinning / rotating disc designed for ultra-low volume (ULV) and  controlled droplet application of  insecticides, fungicides, pesticides, herbicides and all liquids. Rotating disc  technology ensures efficient liquid atomization to give appropriate droplet size.  ULV formulations are applied at only 2.5-7.5 litres / ha. One hectare of crop  can be treated in around 2.5 hour </p>
                <p><strong>HAND ATOMIZER</strong><br />
                This sprayer is also ideally suited  for home gardens and small fields. It consists of a container of 0.5 to 3.51it  capacity a built in air pump, pressure gauge , nozzle and flow cut off  lever. The tank is to be filled with ¾ th  volume. The pump is operated to build pressure in the tank of 0.15-0.3 kg/cm2  . When the   flow cut off lever is  pressed , the fluid passes through the nozzle and spraying is done. The  application rate ranges from 45 to 100 litres /ha.</p>

                  This sprayer is suitable for applying chemicals to several field  crops. The operator carries the sprayer on his back and hence the name knapsack  sprayer. It has a flat or bean-shaped tank of 10-15 litres capacity., a  hydraulic pump fitted inside the tank, a handle to operate the pump, agitator, filter,  delivery hose, and spray gun with nozzle and flow control lever.  The tank is made of either brass or PVC  material. The tank is filled with chemical solution. When the pump is operated,  it draws the fluid through the suction hole and delivers it to the spray gun,  When the cut off lever is pressed spraying is done through the nozzle as fine  droplets. The pressure developed in these sprayers depends on the pump and  varies from 3 to 12 kg/cm2 The application rate is 500 lit/ha. The coverage  is 0.5-1.0 ha/day.<br />

                <strong>            </strong>Rocker sprayer is mainly  used for spraying fruit trees in orchards, coconut and areca nut trees, flower  gardens, and cotton and tapioca fields. It consists of a piston type pump, a platform  with fork, a lever to operate the pump, pressure chamber, suction hose with  strainer, delivery hose, and a spray gun with flow control knob and nozzle. The  pump builds up a pressure up to 14-18 kg/cm2 which facilitates the  use of the sprayer for tree spraying. The Pressure chamber helps for continuous  spraying. The chemical is taken in a separate container and the suction hose is  kept in the chemical container. When the pump is operated, it draws the fluid  through the suction hose and delivers it to the delivery hose through the  pressure chamber. When the flow control knob is turned, the fluid is sprayed  through the nozzle. The output of the sprayer is 70-90 lit/hr with one nozzle.  Coverage is about 1.5 ha/day.</p>

                <p><strong>FOOT OR PEDAL OPERATED  SPRAYER </strong><br />
                  The foot or pedal sprayers, as they are commonly called, consist  of a plunger assembly, stand, suction hose, delivery hose, spray gun  with a nozzle etc.  One end of the suction hose is fitted with a strainer  and the other end is connected to the pump inlet opening.  Similarly, the delivery hose is fitted at one  end to the delivery opening of the pump and the other end to the spray gun.  Constant pedaling is required for continuous  spray.  It develops a pressure of 17-21  kg/cm2. The chemical is taken in a separate container and the  suction hose is kept in the chemical container. When the pump is operated by  the foot, it draws the fluid through the suction hose and delivers it to the  delivery hose.  When the flow control  lever is pressed, the fluid is sprayed through the nozzle. Agitation of  chemical solution is done by supplying a portion of air from the blower, The  discharge rate with one nozzle is 110-135 l/hr and coverage is 1.0 ha/day<br />
  <strong>KNAPSACK MOTORIZED MIST  BLOWER CUM DUSTER</strong><br />
                It is the simplest engine driven sprayer used in agriculture. It  is carried on the back of the operator. It is used for spraying to all types of  field crops most popularly to paddy, groundnut, cotton and vegetable crops. It  consists of a 1.2- 3.0 hp high speed petrol engine, a blower, a 12 lit chemical  tank, delivery hose, fleeted air hose, flow regulator knob and a plastic  atomizer grate. The tank is filled with the required chemical solution. When  the engine is started, the blower generates a high velocity air to which the  chemical solution is fed. The chemical mixed air stream is broken in to fine  droplets at the atomizer grate and sprayed. . By changing few parts the sprayer  can be converted in to a duster.</p>

                <p><strong>DUSTER</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Duster is a machine used to  apply chemicals in dust form. Dusters make use of air stream to carry  pesticides in finely divided form on the plants. A duster essentially consists  of <br />
                  1. Hopper                    2. Agitator<br />
                  3. Feed control            4. fan or blower<br />
                  5. Delivery  nozzle<br />
  <strong>Types of dusters</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>1. Plunger type                        2. Knapsack type<br />
                  3. Rotary type             4. Power operated duster</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Plunger type - </strong>it is a simple  duster with a small piston. The piston drives a current of air over the dust in  the hopper. The dust is carried away through a delivery spout. Small hand pump  dusters of this type are available and are suitable only where the area to be  dusted is  small like vegetable gardens</li>
                  <li><strong>Knapsack type - </strong>It is a duster  with the powder container carried on the back of the operator. Knapsack dusters  have a hopper through which a current of air is blown to pick up the dust. The  air current is produced by a lever operated leather bellows. Shoulder straps  are used to carry in the field. These dusters are suitable for small areas.</li>
                  <li><strong>Rotary duster – </strong>Hand rotary  dusters are useful to apply chemicals which are in powder form.  It consists of a hopper, a fan, gear box, handle,  delivery hose and a deflector plate. When the handle is rotates the fan rotates  at high speed and draws air from outside. The chemical from hopper is fed in to  the air stream in the suction side of the fan. The chemical mixes with the air,  passes through the delivery line and is applied on the plants. The rate of  delivery can be  regulated  It is used to apply powdery chemicals to  vegetables, sorghum etc. crops. </li>

                  <li><strong>Power operated duster- </strong>Power operated  duster mainly consists of a power driven fan, a hopper and a delivery spout.  The fan creates strong air flow which causes the dust to blow off from the  hopper to a considerable distance vertically or horizontally. Direction of dust  is regulated by a movable spout suitably fitted with the unit. This type of  dusters are used for large areas</li>

                  <strong>5. Arial duster or </strong><strong>crop duster - </strong>&nbsp;  an aircraft is used for dusting or spraying large acreages with pesticides. Aerial  spraying and dusting permit prompt coverage of large areas at the moment when  application of pesticide is most effective and avoid the need for wheeled  vehicles that might damage crops. The technique was greatly improved in the  1960s with the development of ultra-low-volume applicators, in which  concentrated pesticides are distributed in amounts as small as 1 ounce per acre  (70 grams per hectare). <br />
