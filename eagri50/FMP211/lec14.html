				<p><strong>PLANT  PROPAGATION</strong><br />
           Most  plants reproduce more of their kind through production of seeds. This is sexual  reproduction and it involves the exchange of genetic material between two  parent plants. Many ornamental plants do not come &quot;true&quot; from seed. To  increase the numbers of these plants, gardeners and horticulturists use asexual  propagation. In asexual propagation, the new plants are genetically exact copies  or clones of a single parent plant. The methods used in asexual propagation  range from taking leaf cuttings of African violets to grafting apple cuttings  onto root stocks. Fruit tree propagation is  usually carried out through asexual reproduction by grafting or budding the  desired variety onto a suitable rootstock <br />
<strong>           GRAFTING</strong> is a method of asexual plant propagation widely used in  agriculture and horticulture where the tissues of one plant are encouraged to  fuse with those of another. It is most commonly used for the propagation of  trees and shrubs grown commercially. (Grafting is limited to dicots and  gymnosperms. Monocots lack the vascular cambium required). In most cases, one  plant is selected for its roots, and this is called the <strong>stock</strong> or  rootstock. The other plant is selected for its stems, leaves, flowers, or  fruits and is called the <strong>scion</strong>. The scion contains the desired genes to  be duplicated in future production by the stock/scion plant.<br />
<center><img border="0" width="246" height="207" src="lec14_clip_image002.jpg"title="" />     </center>      In stem  grafting, a common grafting method, a shoot of a selected, desired plant  cultivar is grafted onto the stock of another type. In another common form  called budding, a dormant side bud is grafted on the stem of another stock  plant, and when it has fused successfully, it is encouraged to grow by cutting  out the stem above the new bud. </p>
                <p>           <strong>BUDDING</strong> is  a grafting technique in which a single bud from the desired scion is used  rather than an entire scion containing many buds. Most budding is done just  before or during the growing season. However some species may be budded during  the winter while they are dormant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budding requires the same  precautions as grafting. Be sure that the scion and rootstock are compatible,  that the scion has mature buds, and that the cambia of the scion and rootstock  match. Be especially careful to prevent drying or contamination of grafting  materials.<strong></strong><br />
                  <strong>TOOLS  USED FOR BUDDING AND GRAFTING</strong><br />

  <strong>DIBBER</strong><br />
                  Dibbers are used to make holes in  seed bed to plant seeds, seedlings and bulbs. They are ergonomically designed  consisting of a stainless steel sharp dibber and a hard wood handle joined  together using a ferrule. The sharp dibber glides effortlessly into all soils.  Overall length 27cm, weight 290g.<br />

  <strong>GRAFTING  AND BUDDING KNIVES</strong><br />
                  Grafting and budding knives are  designed specifically for these purposes and should not be used for carving and  whittling wood. Using them for other purposes will make cutting edge blunt very  quickly. . Grafting and budding knives must be kept razor sharp so they will  cut smoothly. They are available in either left- or right-handed models. The  blade is beveled on only one side, unlike conventional knives, which have  blades that bevel on both sides down to the cutting edge</p>

The wedge-shaped blade is used to split the stock, and  the flat pick opens the cleft so that the scions can be inserted. Once in  place, the flat pick is removed and the cleft comes together to hold the scions  in position.<strong></strong></p>

                <p><strong>PRUNING  AND LOPPING SHEARS</strong><br />
           Pruning and lopping shears are the  scissors or sliding blade type rather than the blade and anvil type. They are  used to harvest scion wood or bud sticks, As with knives, pruning and lopping  shears should be kept razor sharp to give clean, close cuts<strong></strong><br />
<strong>PRUNING  SHEAR</strong><br />
           Designed for those with smaller hands  who may prefer a smaller, lighter pruner.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is comfortable to use  yet every bit is as sturdy and powerful as other tools. Ideal for small pruning  work such as grape vines, shrubs and young trees&nbsp;The anvil blade is screw  mounted.&nbsp; The short blades facilitate closer cutting to the stem of the  plant. Recommended Cutting Capacity up to  2 cm, length 18 cm and weight 200 gm </p>
                            <center>         <img width="192" height="180" src="lec14_clip_image002_0000.jpg" /><br />  <strong>Pruning shear</strong></center>
                                             
                <p><strong>FOLDING PRUNING SAW</strong><br />
                  <strong>           It  cuts branches up to 4 inches in diameter. Overall length 35 cm and  blade length 15 cm. The shape of the blade is  thinner at the top and thicker at the bottom - where the teeth are. This unique  feature keeps only the teeth in contact with the material to be cut. This  prevents clogging and binding, since the sides of the blade never come in  contact with the wood.&nbsp;</strong><br />

                <p><strong>TREE PLANTING</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                  Tree  planting is the process of transplanting tree seedlings generally for forestry,  land reclamation, or landscaping purposes. A properly planted tree or  shrub will be more tolerant of adverse conditions and require much less  management than one planted incorrectly. Planting technique impacts water  quality as it minimizes water, fertilizer and pesticide use.<br />
                  When  making decisions on planting techniques, one should consider how the plant was  grown in the nursery, the plant's drainage requirements, the soil type and  drainage characteristics, and the availability of irrigation water. The plant  should be specifically appropriate to the site, or the site should be amended  to specifically fit the plant.<br />
  <strong>Planting  depth         </strong><br />
                  The most important consideration in  planting trees and shrubs is the planting depth. Don't plant too deep. It is  better to plant in a raised manner so the roots will not drown or suffocate.  Dig planting holes 2 to 3 times wider than the root ball and the same depth.  Locate the root ball on solid soil and not loose backfill. Wire baskets do not  need to be completely removed from large field grown trees. Cut and fold down  the top half of the basket, fold back the burlap, and remove nylon strings. Be  sure to remove plastic liners or synthetic burlap type materials.</p>

     Using a fruit harvester is faster,  easier and safer way to pick apples, oranges, peaches, plums and more from tree  tops. Manually used fruit harvester consists of a PVC coated wire basket with  finger like prongs that grasp the fruit. Padding is provided to the basket to  protect fruit against bruising. The basket can be securely clamped to any  length pole. The basket measures 31cm L x 15cm Diameter             </p>

                <strong>Manual Fruit Harvester</strong></p>
                <p><strong>CITRUS  HARVESTER</strong>        <br />
                  Two types of mechanical harvesters  are being used today for harvesting citrus <br />
                  a) Continuous  canopy shake system <br />
                  b)  Trunk shake system. Shake and catch system<br />
                  Continuous canopy shake system is a  self-propelled unit that shakes the tree canopy causing the fruit to fall from  the tree and onto a catch frame. Trunk shake system simply shakes fruit to the  ground, requiring the fruit to be picked up by a hand crew.<br />
  <strong>COMMON  FEATURES FOR BOTH TYPES OF HARVESTERS </strong><br />
                  Whether self-propelled or tractor-drawn,  the core unit of a continuous canopy mechanical harvesting unit consists of a  series of whirls stacked horizontally. Each whirl consists of a series of  approximately 6-foot-long, 1.5- to 2-inch-diameter rods mounted to the whirls,  which are connected to a central drum. The rods are generally referred to as  tines. The tines penetrate into the tree canopy, shaking the canopy  horizontally to remove fruit.<br />
                  The shake frequency of the tines can  vary depending on the force needed to remove the fruit. On the OXBO MODEL, the  operator of the shaker assembly can adjust the angle of the tine penetration to  the angle of a hedged tree. The drum is mounted to the controlling unit so that  the interaction of the harvesting tines with the canopy begins at 3 feet from the  soil surface. The drum, which contains the whirls, can be elevated up to 18  feet above the soil surface. During one pass, the drum can harvest up to 18  feet of canopy height. Hedged trees insure uniformity of tree shape and allow  for maximum tine penetration into the tree canopy, thereby increasing fruit  removal. To minimize fruit splitting from impact with the ground or catch  frame, trees should be topped to a maximum of 16 to 18 feet.</p>

                 <p> <strong>SELF-PROPELLED  HARVESTING UNITS- CITRUS HARVESTER</strong><br />
                  Self-propelled harvesting units work  in pairs, one unit for each side of the tree. Each unit has leveling  hydraulics, which allows it to work effectively in bedded groves. The paired  units travel down the tree row at ground speeds that can vary from 0.5 to 1.3  miles per hour, thus allowing 200 to 400 trees per hour to be harvested. Each  unit catches and separates the fruit from leaves and stems, reducing the amount  of trash delivered to the processing plant. Fruit can be conveyed directly to a  goat-type truck, or up to 60 boxes can be temporarily stored on the OXBO  harvester's deck to allow for continuous operation. The goat-type trucks are  similar to a conventional harvesting goat but slightly larger with a capacity  of between 130 and 150 boxes. These units transport the fruit to semi trailers,  which deliver the fruit to the processing plants.<br />
                  For maximum efficiency, the self-propelled  shake and catch units are best suited for groves with uniform tree canopy size.  Canopy uniformity can be facilitated by hedging and topping. Trunk alignment in  the row, clear trunk height of 18 inches to the first branches, and long tree  row length improve harvesting efficiency. Skirting height of 30 inches above  the ground allows for the catch frame to easily travel under the tree canopy,  minimizing lower limb damage and maximizing fruit recovery. Tree topping height  should not exceed 16 to 18 feet and trees should have a canopy width from the  tree trunk to the outer canopy of 6.5 to 8 feet.<br />
                  Some hand labor may be required to  glean any fruit remaining in the tree or to retrieve fallen fruit that missed  the catch frame. Under grove conditions outlined above, continuous shake and  catch systems typically deliver 90 to 95% of the available fruit to the semi  trailer. With gleaning crews, total fruit recovery approaches 98%. In cases  where fruit prices are low, hand labor to glean fruit may not be economical.<br />
                  A self-propelled continuous canopy  shake and catch system uses a crew of six workers - 2 harvester operators and 4  goat drivers. Overall, harvest labor productivity improves from 5 to 10 times  over a hand crew, depending on grove conditions and equipment downtime.<br />
                For groves that lack tree size  uniformity and have not been skirted, the tractor-drawn continuous canopy  shaker provides an option with greater flexibility for the adoption of  mechanical harvesting systems. This tractor-drawn system works in a similar  fashion to the canopy shake and catch units but without the catch frame. Tines  mounted in the whirl remove the fruit from the tree by a horizontal shaking  action, allowing the fruit to fall to the ground. As with the self-propelled  unit, the operator can adjust the tilt and elevation of the drum that contains  the series of stacked whirls. Harvesting area is limited to the height of 18  feet. With an experienced operator and in trees less than 18 feet in height,  95% of the crop can be removed from the tree.</p>
                <p><strong>THE  TRACTOR-DRAWN CANOPY SHAKE SYSTEM- CITRUS HARVESTER</strong><br />
                  The tractor-drawn canopy shake system  must work in conjunction with a hand crew to gather fruit shaken off by the  harvesting unit. The harvester can travel between one-half and one mile per  hour and have the capacity to harvest between 100 and 200 trees per hour. The  efficiency of this harvester is influenced by the size of the pickup crew.  Typically, a harvester shakes only the number of trees that will provide the  fruit that can be picked up within a day.<br />
                  The pick up crew gathers fruit into  8- or 10-box tubs, which are then loaded into conventional high lift trucks or  goats. Since hand crews glean most of the remaining tree fruit, the  tractor-drawn canopy shaker system in conjunction with hand labor delivers up  to 99% of the available crop. When the tractor-drawn canopy shaker is used,  labor harvest efficiencies as compared to standard hand harvesting are improved  by at least twofold.<br />
                  As  with the shake and catch systems, trees should be hedged with a canopy width  from the trunk of the tree to the outer skirt of no more than 8 feet. Trees  should be topped to a height of no more than 18 feet. Multi-stemmed tree trunks  or low hanging branches do not decrease harvesting efficiency as significantly  as they do when the catch frame systems are utilized.<br />
                  Harvesting and roadside costs in the  2003-04 season for continuous canopy shake systems can range from $1.00 to  $1.75 per weight box. The lower cost range reflects well-prepared,  high-yielding trees that are harvested with a catch frame, and does not include  the cost of a gleaning crew to collect non-harvested fruit. The cost per box of  the tractor-drawn system typically is higher due to the additional labor  requirements to gather the fruit from the ground. Actual harvesting costs will  depend on specific grove conditions and gleaning requirements of the grower.<br />
                  Higher-yielding blocks should enjoy a  lower per-box cost of mechanical harvesting. Larger blocks or tracts in close  proximity should command a lower price, since the harvesting equipment can work  more efficiently for a longer sustained period of time. Whatever the price of a  mechanical system, the relative comparison a grower needs to consider is the  price a hand crew would charge to pick and roadside the same volume of fruit.<br />
                  For the Florida citrus grower to  remain competitive in a global environment, all options that reduce the  harvesting costs must be considered. Mechanical harvesting for processed citrus  fruit is a viable option to lower harvesting cost. Ongoing research conducted  by the Florida Department of Citrus, the University of Florida, and private  companies show that the above systems can reduce harvesting costs by 20 to 40  cents per box. Additionally, studies that have been conducted for multiple  years have shown no adverse effects in tree health, productivity, or tree  longevity where these systems have been used.<br />
  <strong>TRACTOR OPERATED TURMERIC  HARVESTER</strong><br />
                  The unit consists of a blade with  five bar points for easy penetration into the soil, a main frame and a hitch  frame.. The blade is fixed at an inclination of 20° to a cultivator frame with  straight tynes at both ends for easy penetration in to the soil. It can be  hitched to the tractor at the hitch frame. For digging of turmeric, the blade with  bar points penetrate into the soil, lift the turmeric rhizomes along with the  soil and convey them to the lift rods which aids in separation of the rhizomes  from the soil. The soil slip back to the ground and the dug out rhizomes  deposited at the centre of the unit. The field capacity of the unit is 1.6 ha  per day.  The salient features of the  unit are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Results in 70 per cent saving in cost and 90  per cent in time when compared to manual digging.  </li>

                  <strong>POWER TILLER OPERATED POTATO  DIGGER</strong> <br />
                  Potato is being grown in the hilly  regions. For harvesting potatoes, mechanization or improved implement has to be  introduced to complete the harvest economically and in time. Because of ease of  maneuverability of power tiller in hilly tracts, a potato digger attachment to  power tiller is developed. The unit consists of a shank, a triangular shape  ridger with a share and extension rods and a hitch frame. The share penetrates  into the soil  and the ridger bottom  dig out potato along with the soil. When the  harvested mass moves over the extension rods, the soil slips back to the ground  and the partly cleaned potatoes deposit on the soil. The depth can be adjusted to  set the depth up to 30 cm. The field capacity is 0.4 ha/day.<br />
                The salient features of the unit are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Digging with power tiller drawn potato digger  results in 47.7 per cent of saving in cost and 68.0 per cent of saving in time  when compared to manual digging</li>
