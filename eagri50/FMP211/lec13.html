                <p align="right"><img src="images/back.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="30" usemap="#Map" />
				<p><strong>HARVESTING</strong> <br />
            The  operation of cutting, picking, plucking digging or any combination of these for  removing the whole crop or edible part of the crop from either under the ground  or above the ground is called harvesting<br />
            Mechanical  actions associate with harvesting are as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Slicing action with a sharp tool.</li>
                  <li>Tearing action with a rough serrated edge</li>
                  <li>Scissoring action.</li>
                  <li>High  velocity impact with sharp or dull edge tool.<strong></strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>ACCORDING  TO POWER SOURCE USED HARVESTING TOOLS CAN BE CLASSIFIES AS </strong><br />
                  (1) Manually operated tools (ii) Animal drawn implements  (iii) Power driven machines<strong></strong><br />
  <strong>SICKLE          </strong><br />
                  Sickle is a simple manually  operated harvesting tool. It is used for harvesting crops like paddy, ragi,  sorghum etc. It essentially consists of a curved metallic blade and a wooden  handle. Sickles are classified into two classes: (i) Plain and (ii) Serrated  depending on the nature of the blade edge. In plain sickle the blade edge is  smooth and sharp. In serrated sickle the blade edge is with sharp serrated  teeth. The plain or serrated edge in the inner side of the blade is used for  cutting the crop and hence called   cutting edge The forged end of the blade used for fixing the handle is  called tang.. Harvesting by sickle is a very slow and labour consuming device.<br />

                </strong>
                <p><strong>MOWER</strong> <br />
                  Mower is  a machine to cut herbage crops and leave them in a swath. Animal drawn and  tractor operated mowers are available<br />
                  According  to the cutting tool mowers are classified in to the following types such as:  (i) Cylinder mower (ii) Reciprocating mower (iii) Horizontal rotary mower (iv) Gang  mower and (v) Flail mower.<br />
  <strong>a) Cylinder  mower</strong>: It has rotating helical blades arranged in cylindrical  form. With the rotation of blades, forage or grasses are cut continuously. It  is used for trimming grass in lawns, golf grounds etc. <br />
  <strong>b) Reciprocating  mower</strong>: It is a mower with a knife made of several serrated triangular  sections that reciprocate against stationary fingers. The knife cuts the crop  by its reciprocating action. It is the most common type of mower used for  harvesting forage crops and food grain crops like paddy and wheat. . <br />
  <strong>c) Horizontal  rotary mower</strong>: It is a mower with high speed knife  rotating in the horizontal plane. Due to rotation of knife, the grass and  forage are cut uniformly. Used for trimming lawns , golf grounds etc.<br />
  <strong>d) Gang  mower</strong>: It is an assembly of two or more ground driven cylinder  mowers. It is used for trimming grass in lawns, golf grounds etc. <br />
  <strong>e) Flail  mower</strong>: It is a mower with high speed swinging knives,  operating either in the horizontal plane or in the vertical plane.. Used to cut  herbaceous weeds like parthenium<br />
  <strong>CONVENTIONAL  MOWER</strong> <br />
                  The  conventional mower mainly consists of: (i) A   metallic frame (ii) Power transmitting unit  and (iii) Cutting bar <br />
  <strong>Frame</strong> <br />
                  The  frame provides space for fitting gears, clutch, bearings, flywheel etc required  for the operation of the harvester. A lever is used for lifting the cutting bar  during road travel. . A flywheel is used to store energy from the engine to supply  steady energy to the cutting mechanism for uniform cutting.<br />
  <strong>Power  transmitting unit</strong> <br />
  <strong>            </strong>It transmits the  power from the power source  either from  the ground wheel in animal drawn mowers and from PTO  for tractor drawn mowers to the cutting tool. <br />
                  In  bullock drawn mowers, the power transmitting unit consists of transport wheels,  axle, gears, crank wheel, crankshaft and pitman. The transport wheel gives  power to the axle from where the power is transmitted to crank wheel through  the gears. From crank wheel the drive is transmitted to pitman through  connecting rod. Crank wheel rotates in circular motion and pitman makes  reciprocating motion. Connecting rod converts rotary motion in to reciprocating  motion. Knife is connected to pitman hence the knife reciprocates and performs  the cutting job. There is a ball and socket arrangement to connect the knife  with the pitman. The operator controls the driving unit with the help of a dog  clutch.<br />
                  In tractor  drawn semi-mounted or mounted type mowers the cutter bar is operated by P.T.O.  shaft of the tractor. A carden shaft transmits drive from PTO to the V pulley  of the harvester. From V pulley, drive reaches the knife through gears, crank  wheel, connecting rod and pitman. The knife reciprocates and cuts the crop. The  cutting mechanism is driven independent of the forward motion of the tractor<strong></strong><br />
  <strong>Cutter  bar</strong> <br />
                  It is an  assembly of several parts comprising of a knife, fingers, wearing plates,  ledger plates, guides and shoes. The knife cuts the grass or grain crop by its  reciprocating action`. It is a metallic rectangular bar, on which triangular  sections are mounted. The knife sections make reciprocating motion inside the  fingers and cuts the plants. There are knife guides with clips to keep the  knife sections very closely on the ledger plates for effective cutting action.  The knife stops at the centre of the knife guard (finger) on each stroke which  indicates good registration.. <br />
  <center> <img width="437" height="231" src="lec13_clip_image004.jpg" /><br />
  <strong>Cutter bar</strong> </center>
 <p> <strong>Shoe  -</strong> A shoe is always provided on each end of the  cutter bar to regulate the height of cut and to provide easy and smooth sliding  of the cutter bar on the land.<br />
                  <strong>Ledger plate - </strong>It is a hardened metal  inserted in a guard (finger) over which knife sections move to give a scissor  like cutting action.<br />
  <strong>Wearing  plate - </strong>It is a hardened steel plate attached to the finger bar  to form a bearing surface for the back of the knife.<br />
  <strong>Knife  - </strong>It  is the reciprocating part of the cutter bar, comprising of knife head, knife  back and knife sections.<br />
  <strong>Knife  section - </strong>It is a steel plate of triangular shape with two cutting  edges.<br />
  <strong>Knife  head -</strong>   It is the portion  of the knife which is connected to the pitman.<br />
  <strong>Knife  back -</strong>   It is the strip  of steel to which knife sections are riveted and the knife head is attached.<br />
  <strong>Grass  board -</strong>            Grass  board is provided at the outer end of the mower which causes the cut plants to  fall towards the cut material. <br />
  <strong>Pitman  - </strong>Pitman  is the link between the knife and crank wheel of the mower. It transmits motion  to a knife. Wooden pitman is commonly used for the mowers which acts as safety  device. It breaks and protects the cutter bar from damage when ever the knife  is locked by some obstacle or choked by the crop.<br />
  <strong>Connecting  rod</strong> - It is placed between pitman and crank wheel. It converts rotary motion of  crank wheel in to reciprocating motion of the knife.<br />
  <strong>Breaking  of knives -</strong> Breaking  of knives is a common trouble in operation of a mower. It is caused due to play  in bearings and worn out knife head holders. Non-alignment is an important  cause for breaking the knife because when the mower is out of alignment, it  works on a certain angle which is always harmful.<br />
  <strong>Alignment  of mower</strong> <br />
                  Under  working condition, the standing crops exert pressure on the cutter bar tending  to push it backward. In correct operating position, the crankpin, knife head  and the outer end of the knife should be in a straight line. This line should  be at right angle to the direction of travel of the mower. For achieving this  object, the cutter bar is set at about 88° to the direction of motion i.e.  inward lead of 2° is given to it in order to overcome the back pushing action  of the crops. When the cutter bar is properly aligned, the knife and the pitman  run in a straight line. This gives better cutting of the knife in the field.  Generally 2cm lead per metre length of cutter bar is recommended. <br />
  <strong>Registration  of mower</strong> <br />
                  A mower  knife is said to be in proper <em>registration </em>when the knife section stops in the centre of its guard ( fingers ) on  every stroke i.e. the centre of the knife section is at the centre line of the  guard, when it is in operating condition (Fig.3). Adjustment is commonly made  by moving the entire cutter bar in or out with respect to the pitman. If mower  is not well registered, there is unbalanced load, uneven cutting and excessive  clogging of crops on the knife. </p>

                <h4><strong>SELF  PROPELLED PADDY HARVESTER</strong></h4>
                <p>It is suitable for  harvesting non lodging varieties of paddy crop. The machine consists of an  engine, gearbox, ground wheels, handle, and cutter bar assembly, star wheels  and gathering header assembly. The power is taken from the engine pulley to the  harvester main shaft through compound idlers. The crop is manually harvested  along the four sides of the field for a width of 0.5m and cleared from the  field for providing space to the machine. At one comer an area of 2.0 x 1.5m is  manually harvested to place the machine initially in the field. Since the  harvested crop is discharged at the right side of the reaper the machine has to  be turned always to the left side. During forward motion of the harvester, crop  enters in the cutter bar mechanism and gets sheared and the harvested crop is  conveyed to right side of the machine by the conveyor belt . The harvested crop  is windrowed in the field, collected manually and transported to threshing  yard.  The width of operation is 1.0  metre. The coverage is 1.5 ha/day<br />

                <p>The functional components are<br />
                  1. Header 2. Reel 3. Cutter bar 4. Elevator canvas 5. Feeder  canvas 6. Feeding drum 7. Threshing drum 8. Concave,  9. Fan    10.chaffer sieve 11. Grain sieve  12.grain auger 13. Tailing auger 14. Grain  elevator and 15. Grain container.<br />
                  Header is used to cut and gather the crop and deliver it to the  threshing cylinder.  The straw is pushed  back on the platform by the reel. Small combines use scoop type headers, while  large combines use T type headers<br />
                  Harvesting is done by a cutting unit, which uses the cutter bar  similar to that of the mower.  The knife  has got serrated edge to prevent the straw from slipping while in  operation.  There is a suitable cutting  platform, which is provided with a real and canvas.  <br />
                  The reel is made of wooden slates, which helps in feeding the  crops to the cutting platform.  The reel  gets the power through suitable gears and shafts. The reel revolves in front of  the cutter bar while working in the field. The reel pushes the standing crops  towards the cutting unit. The reels are adjustable up and down as in or  out.  The cutter bar of the combine  operates like the cutter bar of a mower The conveyor feeds the crop to the  cylinder and concave unit.<br />
                  The threshing takes place  between the cylinder and concave unit of the combine. The basic components of  the threshing unit of the combine are similar to a power thresher. As soon as  the crops are threshed the threshed material move to straw racks. These racks  keep on oscillating and separating the grains. <br />
                  The cleaning unit consists of a number of sieves and a fan. The  unthreshed grains pass through the tailing auger and go for re-threshing.  The clean grain passes through the grain  elevator and finally goes to the packing unit. Grains are collected in a hopper  provided at suitable place.  The fan is  adjusted such that the chaff etc., blown off the rear side of the machine. The  size of the combine is indicated by width of cut it covers in the field.<br />

                  A combine may be self-propelled type and PTO driven type<strong></strong><br />
  <strong>Self propelled type</strong><br />
                  This has got its own dependent engine.  This engine gives power for operating all the  mechanisms as well as for pulling the weight of the combine.  Size varies from 2-4 m.<br />
  <strong>PTO driven type</strong><br />
                  This combine is pulled by a tractor.  The tractor pulls the combine by its tractive  power.  The power takes off shaft of the  tractor supplies power to the cutting and threshing mechanisms.  The power requirement of the combine may be  taken on 8 HP/m width of cut for pulled type machine and 12 HP/m width of cut  for self propelled machines.<strong></strong><br />
