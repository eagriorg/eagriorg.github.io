				<p><strong>Ill  effects of uneven land</strong><strong> </strong><br />
1.  The unevenness in land level is sometimes called surface topography. Within a  field unevenness has a major effect on crop management and crop yields.<br />
 2. Unevenness in land level results in uneven  water coverage. (Uneven water coverage means that more water is needed to wet  up the soil for land preparation)<br />
&nbsp;3.  Unevenness in land level results in uneven crop stands, increased weeds and  uneven maturing crops. (All of these factors result in reduced yields and  reduced grain quality).<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Benefits  of Land leveling</strong><br />
1.  Effective land leveling reduces the work in crop establishment and care, and  increases yields. <br />
2.  Level land improves water coverage that reduces the amount of water required  for land preparation, improves crop establishment and care<br />
3.  Decreases the time to complete field tasks<br />
4.  Reduces weed problems<br />
5.  Results in uniform crop maturity<br />
<strong>Principles  of land leveling</strong><br />
            Leveling of land requires soil to be  shifted from the high points of the field to the low points in the most  cost-effective way.<br />
<strong>PROCEDURE  IN LAND LEVELING</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>plough  the field twice</li>
                  <li>Measure  the levelness of the field by conducting a topographic survey.</li>
                  <li>draw  a topographic map of the field</li>
                  <li>mark  the high and low areas in the field</li>
                  <li>move  soil from the high areas to the low areas in the most cost-effective manner</li>
                  <li> repair  levees<strong></strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>a) Plough  the field</strong><br />
                  Plough from the center of the field  outward in lands. If the field is wide it may be more efficient to plough a  number of lands and cut out furrows in each field. Finish with a cut out furrow  around the edge of the field beside the bund. &nbsp;This will help keep the bunds  in good shape, reduce the bund area and also act as drainage lines for the  field most fields will need to be ploughed twice before leveling can commence<strong></strong><br />
  <strong>b) Mark  the high and low spots in the field&nbsp;</strong><br />
                  Using either standing water in the  field or height measurements from a topographic survey, mark the high and low  areas in the field and form a strategy to most efficiently and effectively move  soil from the high to low spots.<br />
                  (Note:  It is difficult to move soil more than 50 meters. If the soil has to be dragged  more than 50 meters it may pay to first move soil from the middle of the field  to the lowest places and then from the higher places to the middle of the  field.)<br />
  <strong>c) Begin  leveling&nbsp;</strong><br />
                  Position the leveling device in the  high part of the field and drag soil to the lower part of the field.<strong></strong><br />
                  (Note.  If the fields are ploughed in lands and the same leveling procedure is adopted  in the second year the field should end up relatively smooth and level.)<br />
  <strong>d) Maintain  or repair levee (bunds)</strong><br />
  &nbsp;Repair  the levees either by first ploughing soil up against the levee or manually  using a hoe or shovel. This is best done after leveling. Bulldozers can level  fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;levees can be manually repaired<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />
                  (Note.  Levees need to be maintained as any advantage of improved water management through  leveling will be lost if water is able to escape through or over the levees.)<br />
  <strong>LAND  LEVELING USING DRAFT ANIMALS</strong><br />
                  To  level a field using a draft animal and a leveling board the following equipment  are needed:<br />
                  1.  Animal or pair of animals (oxen, caribou)<br />
                  2.  Plough (moldboard)<br />
                  3.  Harrows or leveling board<br />
                  4.  Water source and Water pump (if fields are not flooded)<br />
                  With water in the field, mark or  note the high and low areas and form a strategy to most effectively move soil  from the high to low spots. Weight will need to be added on to the harrow to  move the soil. A ratio of 40kg weight/meter width of leveling board gives the  best results.<br />
  <strong>LAND  LEVELING USING A 4-WHEEL TRACTOR AND BACK BLADE</strong> <br />
                  To level a field using a 4-wheel  tractor and a back blade the following additional equipment are needed:<br />
                  1.  Plough (disc, moldboard or tine)<br />
                  2.  harrows (disc or tine)<br />
                  3.  Tractor blade or drag bucket<br />
                  4.  Surveying equipment<br />
                  A field diagram should be drawn  noting the level of cut and fill required in the field. With water in the  field, mark or note the high and low areas and form a strategy to most  effectively move soil from the high to low spots. Tractor hydraulic system will  be used to lower or lift the leveling blade.<br />
  <strong>LEVELING A LAND FOR A SMALL LAWN</strong> <br />
  <strong>1. Initial preparation of land for a lawn</strong> <br />
                  Making a  level lawn area is simple  although does require some physical effort for the initial digging. Once the  area has been dug over, the rest of the procedure is straightforward and easy.<br />
                  It is  wise to wait several weeks before seeding a newly graded area, especially if a  lot of filling has been done, because the soil will settle and may form  hollows. Any hollows that form must be filled and allowed to settle again or  tramped down to ensure that the area is fairly level. To hasten the soil  settling, give it a thorough and deep soaking with water.<br />
  <strong>2. Preparing Area </strong><strong>for lawn</strong> <br />
                  Mark out  the area where you wish to plant a lawn with brightly colored paint in a spray  can. Dig over the soil within that area to loosen it. Hammer flat-topped  square-headed wooden stakes at each corner of the area and 10 to 15 cm apart in  the ground in each direction. Level the stakes with a carpenter's level placed  on a board which is long enough to reach three stakes. Each stake should  protrude from the ground by 7.5 cm to 10 cm Adjust the stakes as necessary to  ensure that they are all level. Always work with the board over three stakes;  left to right, right to left or diagonally. Do this until all the stakes have  been made level. Add some rich soil to top dress that already in place after  all stakes have been adjusted. This topsoil should be uniformly level with the  tops of all stakes. Fertilize the area according to the seed producer’s  instructions. Scratch the surface area with a bamboo rake or a light lawn broom  and your lawn area is ready to seed. </p>
                <p align="center"><img border="0" width="455" height="236" src="lec15_clip_image002.jpg" title="LevelLawn.jpg" /></p>
                <p><strong>3. Seeding</strong><strong> a lawn</strong> <br />
                  Lay out  a grid in the area to be seeded with strings stretched between tent pegs at the  sides and the ends to form rectangles not more than 10' across. Place one or  more planks on which to stand while sowing so as to avoid walking on the  ground. Sow across each rectangle from side to side as an individual unit.  Repeat the sowing from end to end. Rake the seed lightly into the surface with  a bamboo rake or a lawn broom. Roll or lightly tramp down the whole area to  firm the seed in the soil. Keep the area well watered. </p>

<p>                  <strong>CHISEL  PLOUGH</strong><br />
                  The chisel plough is a common tool to get  deep tillage (prepared land) with limited soil disruption. The main function of  this plough is to loosen and aerate the soils  while leaving crop residue at the top of the soil. This plough can be used to  reduce the effects of compaction and to help  break up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plowpan" title="Plowpan">plough pan</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardpan" title="Hardpan">hardpan</a>. Unlike many other ploughs the chisel will not  invert or turn the soil. This characteristic has made it a useful addition to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-till_farming" title="No-till farming">no-till</a> and low-till farming practices  which attempt to maximise the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_erosion" title="Soil erosion">erosion</a>-prevention  benefits of keeping organic matter and farming residues present on the soil surface through the  year.<center><img width="280" height="176" src="lec15_clip_image011.jpg"  /> <br />

                <p>
                  The chisel plough is typically set to  run up to a depth of 300 to 400&nbsp;mm. However some models may run much  deeper. Each of the individual ploughs, or shanks, are typically set from 230&nbsp;mm  to 305&nbsp;mm apart. Such a plough can encounter significant soil drag,  consequently a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractor" title="Tractor">tractor</a> of sufficient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power" title="Power">power</a> and good  traction is required. When planning to plough with a chisel plough it is  important to bear in mind that 10 to 15 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower" title="Horsepower">horsepower</a> (7 to 11&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#Kilowatt" title="Watt">kW</a>)  per shank will be required.</p>
