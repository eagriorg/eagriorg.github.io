				<p><strong>Area under cultivation</strong><br />
It is  cultivated in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jodhpur (Rajasthan), Karnataka,  Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.<br />
<strong>Family: </strong>Poaceae<br />
<strong>Plant Description </strong><br />
Palmarosa  is a wild growing plant related to lemongrass. It has fragrant leaves, long  slender stems and terminal flowering tops. It is a drought hardy grass  attaining a height of 1.5 to 2.5m having hairy and fibrous shallow root system  with long linear lanceolate leaves. It produces large fawn coloured  inflorescence containing while, hairy star like spiked flowers. <br />

<img width="233" height="229" src="lec21_clip_image004.jpg" alt="Palmarosa Essential Oil" /></p>
                <p><strong>Soil</strong><br />
                  A  well-drained sandy loam soil with soil pH of 7.5-8.5 is ideal for cultivation  of Palmarosa and receiving rainfall of about 150 cm annually is an It can also  be cultivated in well-drained clay loam soil which are free from water logging.<br />
  <strong>Climate</strong><br />
                  Warm  tropical climate upto 300m elevation in the foothills is suitable for  cultivation of Palmarosa. Temperature ranging from 10 - 360C with annual  rainfall around 1000mm and ample sunshine are congenial for its growth. Moist  and warm climate throughout the year accelerates its growth. Areas, which are  affected by severe frost, are not suitable as the frost kills the grass and  reduces the oil content.</p>

                <p><strong>Propagation</strong><br />
                  <strong>Raising Seedlings in Nursery</strong><br />
                  Usually  nursery is sown by end of April to mid of May under partial shade. Nursery beds  are well prepared in May. The nursery beds are made by adding enough FYM ,  compost or organic matter. Channels are dug around the beds to provide  irrigation. Normally 2 - 2.5 kg of seed is required to cover 100 sq.m nursery,  which provides sufficient seedlings to plant one hectare area. As the seeds are  small and light, they are mixed with fine soil for obtaining even distribution  and ease in sowing. They are sown in lines, 15-20 cm apart. Seeds should not be  sown densely to avoid overcrowding of seedlings The beds are watered lightly  and regularly. Germination starts within two weeks. Later on, 0.2-0.5% solution  of urea may be sprayed for good vegetative growth. In about 3-4 weeks,  seedlings are ready for transplanting.<br />
  <strong>By Slips</strong><br />
                  For better  quality and yield of oil it is recommended to grow Palmarosa by slips obtained  by dividing well-grown clumps. Tops of clumps are cut off within 20-25 cm of  the root. The latter is divided into slips and the lower brown sheath is  removed to expose young roots. Slips should be taken from plants giving a good  yield and a high quality of oil. However the rate of establishment of rooted  slips is very poor as compared to nursery transplants. Slips should be planted in  June-July or during the rainy season.</p>
                <p><strong>Planting</strong><br />
                  The field  is prepared before the onset of monsoon. It is ploughed and harrowed so as to  give a fine tilth. All the stubble and roots of weeds are removed. The  seedlings are transplanted in the fields as soon as the rainy season sets in.  They can be transplanted even earlier, if the weather is not very warm and  irrigation is available. Healthy and established seedlings, which are about 15  cm in height, are carefully removed from the nursery and are planted at a  spacing of 60 cmx60cm.<br />
  <strong>Intercultural Operations</strong><br />
                  The  plantation should be kept free from weeds by regular weeding and hoeing. Two  weeding cum hoeing operations are recommended, first 40 days after  transplanting and the second 30 - 40 days after the first weeding. Among  herbicides, Diuron @ 1.5 kg ai/ha or Oxyfluorfen @ 0.5 kg ai/ha are effective  for weed control.<br />
  <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
                  Requirement  of irrigation depends upon the climatic conditions. The grass requires  irrigation fortnightly during the growing season. With an ample supply of  water, growth is luxuriant. It is a drought hardy species. However its growth  is slow under rainfed cultivation where the plants grow in height but seldom  covers the entire field. Two irrigations in rainfed crop significantly  increased herbage and oil yields.<br />
  <strong>Manuring &amp; Fertilization</strong><br />
                  Palmarosa  is a long duration crop and removes substantial quantities of nutrients from  the soil for producing herbage. Therefore, use of FYM @ 10 t /ha, 40 kg N, 50  kg P 0 and 40 kg K O as a 2 5 2 basal dose is recommended. About 60kg N/ha is  applied in three split doses during the growing season. The application of NPK  should be repeated in subsequent years. In fertile soils, manuring may not be  required for the first two years. By manuring rich soils, the vegetative growth  is increased and oil content may be slightly reduced.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting</strong><br />
                  The  essential oil is distributed in all parts of the grass, viz., flower heads,  leaves and stems, the flower heads containing the major portion. It is  recommended to harvest the crop 7-10 days after opening of flowers. The number  of harvest depends upon the climatic condition of the place of cultivation and method  of crop management. During the first year, usually one crop is obtained in  October-November, whereas 2-3 crops are obtained in the subsequent years in  subtropical areas in the North Indian plains. Four harvests are taken in  tropical areas of South and North-East. Usually, the grass is cut at a height  of 5-8 cm from the ground level and the whole plant is used for distillation.  The maximum yield of oil is obtained when the entire plant is at a full  flowering stage. The harvested herbage is spread in the field for 4-6 hours to  reduce its moisture by 50% and such semi-dry produce can be stacked in shady  cool space for few days without much loss of its oil.<br />
  <strong>Yield</strong><br />
                  Palmarosa  plantation remains productive for about eight years. However, the yield of  grass and oil starts decreasing from the fourth year onwards. It is, therefore,  recommended that the plantation be kept only for four years. Normally 200-250  q/ha of fresh herbage is obtained in first cutting and between 250-320q/ha in  second and subsequent harvests upto three years under irrigated conditions. On  an average, 200 kgs of oil are received during the growing period of 15-16  months. <br />
                  The yield of oil for the first four  years is as under:<br />
                  1st  year 60kg/ha<br />
                  2nd year 80kg/ha<br />
                  3rd year 80kg/ha<br />
                  4th year 80kg/ha<br />
  <strong>Uses</strong><br />
                  Oil of  Palmarosa is used in perfumery, particularly for flavoring tobacco and for  blending of soaps due to the lasting rose-note it imparts to the blend. It also  serves as a source for very high grade geraniol. Geraniol is highly valued as a  perfume and as a starting material for large chemicals, viz., geranyl esters  that have a permanent rose-like odour.<br />
  <strong>Distillation</strong><br />
                  The grass  is either distilled afresh or is allowed to wilt for 24 hours. Wilting reduces  the moisture content and allows a larger quantity of grass to be packed into  the still, thus economizing the fuel use. The current method of distillation  adopted in Kerala is primitive and obsolete and gives oil of poor quality, as  it is based on hydro-distillation or direct-fired still. For good quality oil,  it is advisable to adopt steam-distillation. The equipment for distillation  consists of a boiler to produce steam, a distillation tub, a condenser and one  to three separators. The distillation tub is made of mild steel and has a  perforated bottom over which the grass rests. The tub has a steam inlet pipe at  the bottom. A removable lid is fitted on to the top. Charging and discharging  can be done in perforated cages with iron chains, which can be lowered in the  tub with the help of a chain- pulley block. Different types of condensers are  available, but tubular condensers are better than others. The condenser is  provided with an inlet and outlet by means of which cold water is made to flow  through the chamber to cool the pipes when the distillate flows through them. <br />
                  To obtain  the maximum yield of oil and to facilitate release of oil, the grass is chopped  into shorter lengths. Chopping the grass has further advantages that more grass  can be charged into the still and even packing is facilitated. The grass should  be packed firmly as this prevents the formation of steam channels. The steam is  allowed to pass into the still with a steam pressure from 18 to 32 kg in the  boiler. The mixture of vapours of water and Palmarosa oil passes into the  condenser. As the distillation proceeds, the distillate collects in the  separator. The oil being lighter than water and insoluble floats on the top of  the separator and is continuously drawn off. The oil is then decanted and  filtered. Small cultivators can use direct-fire stills, but in such cases,  properly resigned stills should be used. These stills are provided with a boiler  at the bottom of the tub. This is separated by a false bottom from the rest of  the tub. Water is poured at the bottom of the tub and grass is charged in the  top portion. In the still, the water does not come in contact with the grass. The  oil is stored in containers, preferably of glass or well-tinned iron.  Containers should completely be filled to exclude any air and protect from  sunlight as they affect the oil content<br />
