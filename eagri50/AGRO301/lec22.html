				<p><strong>Common names</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Ishagola, Isabghul, Spogel seed,  Ispaghal, Psyllium seed, Flea seed, Plantain seed, Isabgol and Ishabgul Spogel  seed.<br />
                  <strong>Origin and distribution</strong><br />
                  <em>Plantago  ovata </em>Forsk.  belonging to the family Plantaginaceae has good export potential and can be  exploited commercially. It is indigenous to the Mediterranean region and West  Asia, It has been introduced in India &amp; Cultivated specially in Gujarat and  some parts of Rajasthan. It is also found in Punjab plains and low hills from  Sutlej westwards, Sindh and Baluchistan. The area under cultivation is  estimated about 50,000 ha with a production of 48,000 tonnes of seeds. Psyllium  is the common name used for several members of the plant genus <em>Plantago </em>whose  seeds are used commercially for the production of mucilage. The genus <em>Plantago </em>contains over 200 species. <em>P. ovata </em>and <em>P. psyllium </em>are  produced commercially in several European countries, the former Soviet Union,  Pakistan, and India. <em>Plantago </em>seed known commercially as black, French  or Spanish psyllium is obtained from <em>P. psyllium </em>and <em>P. arenaria</em>.<br />
                  <strong>Parts used</strong><br />
Husk from  spikes and seeds<br />
<strong>Active principle</strong><br />
Protein,  polysaccharides, cellulose, pectin, oil and muscilage<br />
<strong>Uses</strong><br />
Husk is  used as single drug for cure of constipation and dysentery. The drug is used in  inflammatory conditions of the mucous membrane of gastro intestinal and  genitourinary tracts and against irritation. It is also used as demulcent,  cooling, diuretic.<br />
<strong>Species and Varieties</strong><br />
<strong>Species</strong><br />
1. Spanish or French Psyllium seed: <em>Plantago  psyrium </em>Linn, or of <em>Plantago indica </em>Linn.                 (<em>P. arenaric </em>Wald.)<br />
2. Blonde Psyllium or Indian Plantago: <em>Plantago ovata </em>Fork<br />
<strong>Varieties</strong><br />
RI-87, RI-89, AMB-2, GI-1, GI-2, MI-4,  MIB-121, HI-34, HI-2, HI-1, HI-5, JI-4, NIHARIKA. Gujarat Isabgol-1, variety  yields 800-900 kg of seeds per hectare. The new variety 'Gujarat Isabgol-2' has  a potential to yield 1,000 kg of seeds per hectare.<br />
<strong>Soil</strong><br />
It is an  irrigated crop, which grows well on light soils, soil with poor drainage is not  conducive for good growth of this crop. A silty-loam soil having a soil pH from  4.7 to 7.7 with high nitrogen and low moisture content is ideal for growth of  plants and high yield of seeds.<br />
<strong>Climate</strong><br />
Isabgol  thrives well in warm- temperate regions. It requires cool and dry weather &amp;  is sown during winter months. Sowing during first week of November gives best  yields. Early sowing makes the crop vulnerable to downy mildew disease, whereas  late sowing provides lesser period of growth in winter along with possibility  of shattering of seed due to summer rains in April-May. At maturity, if the  weather is humid, its seeds shatter resulting reduction in yield. Heavy dew or  even a light shower will proportionately decrease the yield, at times leading  to even total loss of the crop. The temperature requirement for maximum seed  germination is reported to be 20 to 300C.<br />
<strong>Propagation</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>Through Seeds<br />
<strong>Land preparation and planting</strong><br />
Field must  be free of weeds and clods. The number of ploughings, harrowing and hoeing  depend upon the soil conditions, previous crop and degree of weed infestation.  About 10-15 tonnes of FYM per hectare is mixed into the soil at the time of  last ploughing. The field should be divided into suitable plots of convenient  size, depending upon the texture of the soil, the slope of the field and  quantum of irrigation. For light soil with even contour, plot size of 8.0 m x  3.0 m will be convenient.<br />
To obtain  high percentage of germination, seed should be taken from the crop harvested at  the end of the preceding crop season. Old seeds tend to lose viability under  ordinary storage conditions. Seed at the rate of 4-8 kg per hectare is sown  after treating it with any mercurial seed-dresser at the rate of 3 g/kg of  seed, to protect the seedlings from the possible attack of damping off. The  seeds are small and light. Hence before sowing, the seed is mixed with  sufficient quantity of fine sand or sieved farmyard manure. The seeds are  broadcasted because sowing in lines at different spacing does not increase the  seed yield. After broadcasting, seeds are swept lightly with a broom to cover  them with some soil. Broom however, should be swept in one direction only, to  avoid deep burial of the seed for uniform germination. The sowing should  immediately be followed by irrigation. Germination begins in four days after  sowing. If delayed, it should be stimulated by another watering.<br />
<strong>Manuring</strong><br />
The  medicinal plants have to be grown without chemical fertilizers and use of  pesticides. Organic manures like, Farm Yard Manure (FYM), Vermi-Compost, Green  Manure etc. may be used as per requirement of the species.<br />
<strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
Immediately  after sowing, light irrigation is essential. First irrigation should be given  with light flow or shower of water otherwise, with fast current of water most  of the seeds will be swept to one side of the plot and the germination and  distribution will not be uniform. The seeds germinate in 6-7 days. If the  germination is poor, second irrigation should be given. Later on irrigations  are given as and when required. Last irrigation should be given at the time  when maximum number of spikes shoots up. The crop requires totally 6-7  irrigations for its good productivity in medium sandy soils.<br />
<strong>Weeding</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>Periodical weeding and hoeing is  required.<br />
<strong>Plant protection</strong><br />
To prevent  diseases, bio-pesticides could be prepared (either single or mixture) from  Neem (kernel, seeds &amp; leaves),  Chitrakmool, Dhatura, Cow's urine etc.<br />
<strong>Harvest</strong><br />
Blooming  begins two months after sowing and the crop become ready for harvest in  February-March (110-130 days after sowing). When mature, the crop turn  yellowish and the spikes turn brownish. The seeds are shed when the spikes are  pressed even slightly. At the time of harvest, the atmosphere must be dry and  there should be no moisture on the plant, harvesting will lead to considerable  seed shattering. Hence, the crop should be harvested after 10 am.<br />
<strong>Yield</strong><br />
Seed:  900-1500 kg/ha, Husk: 225-375 kg/ha<br />
<strong>Post harvest technology</strong><br />
Harvested  plants spread over and after 2 days they are threshed with tractor/bullocks.  Pinkish type husk are removed from the seed coat by processing through a series  of grinding in mills to separate husk.</p>
