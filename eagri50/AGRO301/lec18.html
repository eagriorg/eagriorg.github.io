                <p>Mints  are a group of perennial herbaceous plants, belonging to the family <em>Lamiaceae:Labiatae</em>, which yield  essential oil on distillation.  The  various species of mints which are commercially cultivated in different parts  of the world are:Japanese mint or corn mint or field mint (<em>Mentha arvensis subsp</em> <em>haplocalyx </em>Briquet  var. <em>Piperscens</em> Holmes var. <em>Javanica</em>),  peppermint (<em>M.Piperita L.)</em> spearmint  or garden mint or lamb mint (<em>M.spicata L.</em>)  and bergamot mint or orange mint (<em>M.citrata  Ehrh</em>.)         <br />
                  <strong>Distribution</strong><br />
                  Mint  is believed to have originated in the Mediterranean basin and, from there,  spread to the rest of the world by both natural and artificial means. Among the  mints, Japanese mint is cultivated on a large scale in Brazil, Paraguay, China,  Argentina, Japan, Thailand, Angola and India. Peppermint is grown in the USA,  Morocco, Argentina, Australia, France, USSR, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,  Italy, Switzerland and on a small scale in many Europe countries. USA is the  major producer of peppermint and spearmint. <br />
                  The  total area under mint cultivation, which is mostly confined to Uttar Pradesh  and the Punjab is around 10,000 ha. <br />

  <strong>Chemical Composition and Uses</strong><br />
  <strong><em>Japanese  mint (M.arvensis)</em></strong><br />
                  Japanese  mint is a primary source of menthol.  The  fresh leaves contain .4-6.0% oil.  The  main constituents of the oil are menthol (65-75%), menthone (7-10%) and menthyl  acetate (12-15%) and terpenes (pipene, limonene and comphene). <br />
  <strong><em>Peppermint  (M.piperita)</em></strong><br />
                  The  fresh herb contains essential oils ranging from 0.4 to 0.6%. The constituents  of peppermint oil are almost similar to Japanese mint oil.  However, the menthol content is lower in  peppermint oil and varies between 35-50%. The other constituents are menthyl  acetate (14-15%), menthone (925%) menthoufuran and terpenes like pinene and  limonene.<br />
  <strong><em>Bergamot  mint (M.citrate)</em></strong><strong> </strong><br />
                  Linalool  and linalyl acetate are the main constituents of Bergamot mint oil. The oil is  used directly in perfumes. Cosmetic preparations like scents, soaps,  after-shave lotions and colognes also contain this oil.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Spearmint  (M.spicata)     </em></strong><br />
                  The  principal constituent of spearmint oil is carvone (57.71%) and the other minor  constituents are phellandrene, limonene,L-pinene and cinelole.  The oil is used mostly as a flavouring in  toothpastes and as food flavouring in pickles and spices, chewing gum and  confectionery, soaps and sauces.<br />
  <strong>Seasons</strong><br />
                  In  the plains, planting is done during the winter months, whereas in temperate  climates, planting is done in autumn or spring from the last week of December  to the first week of March or from the first week of January to the third week  of February. Late planting always gives poor yields.<br />
  <strong>Soil</strong><br />
                  Medium  to fertile deep soil, rich in humus is ideal for the cultivation of mint.  The soil should have a good water-holding  capacity but water-logging should be avoided. A pH range of 6-7.5 is best.<br />
  <strong>Climate</strong><br />
                  Japanese  mint can be grown in all tropical and subtropical areas under irrigation.  However, it does not tolerate damp winters which cause root-rot. A temperature  of 20-25⁰C promotes  vegetative growth, but the essential oil and menthol are reported to increase  at a higher temperature of 30⁰C  under Indian conditions. Peppermint and spearmint cannot be grown profitably in  tropical and sun tropical areas, especially those areas with very high summer  temperatures (41⁰C) and the ideal  yield is obtained only in humid and temperate conditions like in Kashmir and  the hills of Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. Open, sunny situations without  excessive rains during the growing period are congenial for the good growth and  development of the oil.<br />
                  Bergamot  mint can be grown both in temperate as well as subtropical area. However, the  yield is higher in temperate climates.<br />
  <strong>Land Preparation</strong><br />
                  Mints  require thoroughly ploughed, harrowed, fine soil.  All the stubble of weeds should be removed  before the crop is planted. Manuring may be done at the time of land  preparation by adding FYM @ 25 to 30 t/ha. Green manuring may also be done  before the mint is planted. Sun-hemp (<em>Crotalaria  juncea</em> L.)  is an ideal green manure  crop. Mints are planted on flat land or ridges. Hence, flat beds of convenient  sizes or ridges are made according to the spacing recommended.</p>
                <p><strong>Cultivation</strong><br />
                  <strong><em>Propagation</em></strong><br />
                  Mints  are propagated through the creeping stolons or suckers. In the case of  peppermint and bergamot mint, even runners are planted. Stolen are obtained  from the previous year&rsquo;s planting. A hectare of well-established mint, on an  average, provides enough planting material for ten hectares. About 400 kg  stolons are required for planting one hectare of land. The best time for  obtaining stolons is during the months of December and January.<br />
  <strong>Planting </strong><br />
                  The  stolons are cut into small pieces (7-10 cm) and planted in shallow furrows  about 7-10 cm deep with a row-to-row distance of 45-60 cm, manually or  mechanically. While planting on ridges, the stolons are planted half-way down  on the inner sides of the ridges. The plot is irrigated immediately after  planting.<br />
  <strong>Fertilizer Application</strong><br />
                  Mint  responds very well to a heavy application of nitrogenous fertilizers. The  increase in herbage by the application of phosphorus is not as remarkable as in  case of nitrogen. Generally, nitrogenous fertilizers @ 80-120 kg P and K at 50  kg P2O5 and 40 kg K2O/ha is required for a  good crop of mint. However, in M.arvensia an increase of up to 160 kg N/ha and,  in M.piperate, 125 kg N/ha has given increased fresh herbage and essential  oil-yield. An amount of 100-120 kg N/ha is recommended for producing the  optimum herb and oil-yield in <em>M.citrata </em>under  Pantnagar conditions. A split application of 75 kg N/ha in combination with P  at 60 kg P2O5/ ha is recommended under Kodaikanal  conditions. Potassium application has no significant effect on herb and  oil-yield. In <em>M.spicata</em>, the maximum  herb-yield is obtained with the application of 100-120 kg N/ha. Nitrogen may be  applied in three split doses at 1, ½-2 and 3 months after planting and the  third dose after the first harvest of the crop.<br />
                  Boron  deficiency reduces both the yield of green herb and the essential oil in  peppermint. Increased yields of herb, menthol content and essential oil content  in peppermint have been obtained by using a combination of boron and zinc  fertilizers, Visual symptoms have been documented for some cultivars of  Japanese mint towards Fe and Zn deficiencies. With respect to Zn, the crop  response was maximum at 20 kg/ha if Zn applied at planting. Similarly,  experiments conducted at the CIMAP, Lucknow, have shown that the application of  20 kg/ha of sulphur will increase the herb and oil-yield in <em>M.spicata.</em>    Among the different sources of S, calcium  sulphate was best followed by ammonium sulphate and elemental sulphur. <br />
  <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
                  The  water requirement of mint is very high. Depending upon the soil and climatic  conditions, the crop is irrigated 6-9 times before the first monsoon. The crop  requires three irrigations after the monsoons during September, October and  November. Sometimes another irrigation is required during winter, if the plant  is dormant and there are no winter rains to encourage proper growth of the  under ground stems. Experiments conducted at Pantnagar have revealed that  fifteen irrigation are required to get the maximum herb and oil-yield in  Japanese mint.  When mints are grown in  temkperte climates, only 3-4 irrigation during the period from July to October  are required.<br />
  <strong>Inter-culture and Weed Control</strong><br />
                  Uninterrupted  weed growth causes about 60% reduction in herb and oil-yields. Hence, mints  require weeding and hoeing at regular intervals in the early stages of crop  growth. One hand-weeding is required after the first harvest. Sinbar is the  only herbicide which controls a large number of weeds effectively, when applied  as a post-emergence spray @ 1 kg/ha. However, combining organic mulch with a  combination of 0.5 kg/ha of Oxyfluorfen herbicide and weeding or application of  Pendimethion herbicide at 1 kg/ha and weeding are found to give excellent weed  control throughout the crop growth. Dalapon (4 kg/ha), or Gramaxone (2.5 1/ha)  as post-emergent spray; Diuron (2 kg a.i/ha) or Terbacil treatment (2 kg  a.i/ha) as preemergent treatment are also recommended for chemical weed control  in mints.<br />
                  In  low temperature areas, the plants become dormant in November. In order to give  a perennial crop (of 3 years only) in peppermint, recultivation is done either  in autumn (November-December) or in spring (March-April). When peppermint is  grown as a perennial crop, the first year crop is called &lsquo;Row mint&rsquo;, while the  second and third year crop is called &lsquo;Meadow mint&rsquo;. This practice is not  followed in other mints which are to be planted every year. <br />
  <strong>Crop Rotation</strong><br />
                  Crop  rotations help to maintain a reasonable control on weed growth, preserve the  fertility of the soil and to obtain higher returns from the land. The following  crop rotations are in practice in Uttar Pradesh (a) Mint-maize-potato) (b)  Mint-early paddy and potato and (c) Mint-late paddy and sweet pea. Whereas, in  Punjab, the farmers practice mint-maize and rape seed/mustard and mint-maize  and potato or mint and paddy rotation.<br />
                  The  recommendation for the Terai region of Uttar Pradesh is a 2-year rotation of  mint-summer fallowing or millet (fodder) followed by mint on poor fertility  lands and mint-wheat-paddy and mint on medium fertile lands.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting </strong><br />
                  Japanese  mint is generally harvested after 100-120 days of planting, when the lower  leaves start turning yellow. If the harvesting is delayed the leaves start  falling, resulting in loss of oil. Further, harvesting should be done in bright  sunny weather. Harvesting consists of cutting the green herb by means of a  sickle 2-3 cm above the ground. A second harvest is obtained about 80 days  after the first harvest and the third one after about 80 days from the second  harvest. Whereas, in peppermint, spearmint and bergamot mints which are grown  in temperate climates, the first crop is ready by the end of June and the  second in September or October.<br />
  <strong>Yield</strong><br />
                  A  good crop of Japanese mint can give as high a yield as 48 t/ha of fresh herb.  However, the average yield of mints from three cuttings is 20-25 t/ha. The fresh  herb contains 0.4% oil.<br />
  <strong>Distillation of Oil</strong><br />
                  Mint  oil is obtained by distilling either the fresh or the dry herb. The  distillation is done both in primitive and modern stills; in the former the  principle of water and steam-distillation is followed. While in the later steam  generated in a separate boiler is employed. The stems are removed from the  dried material prior to distillation, because they constitute 30 to 50% of the  material and contain only traces of the oil.<br />
                  The  average yield of oil is 50-70 kg/ha. Although bergamot mint as well as Japanse  mint  give an average yield of 70-100  kg/ha, the yield of peppermint oil is lower with an average of 50 kg/ha.<br />
  <strong>Storage of Oil</strong><br />
                  Mint  oil is a light and golden-coloured, motile liquid and it should be completely free  from moisture before storage. It is stored in large steel, galvanized steel or  aluminium containers, filled up to the brim to protect against any air  remaining inside and placed in a cool storage godown, away from light and  humidity. </p>
