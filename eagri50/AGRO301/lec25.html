				  <li>Indian tobacco is exported to more than 80 countries       spread over in all the continents accounting 4% of global tobacco exports.       The total production of all tobacco varieties in India accounts for about       8.0% of total global production whereas it stands fifth in Flue Cured       Virginia tobacco production registering only 3.3% of world production.</li>
				  <li>Tobacco as a single largest commodity is the fourth       leading revenue earner for the central Government contributing about 10%       of the total Excise revenue collection and around 5% of agricultural       exports from India, corresponding to Rs.5000 crores and Rs.1000 crores       respectively.</li>
				  <li>India produces       7-8% of world's tobacco, while China alone accounts for nearly 40%. </li>

                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Tobacco       is cultivated in around 10000 ha in Tamil Nadu.</li>
                  <li>The crop is transplanted during September – October and       harvested in January – February.</li>
                  <li>Sun-cured tobacco varieties are transplanted from mid       October to mid December.</li>
                  <li>High quality cheroot tobacco types are transplanted in       November and December months.</li>
                  <li>Nattu tobacco is transplanted in Bhavani area in       October and even during November – December after the harvest of rice.</li>
                  <li>In Sentharaipatti area, tobacco is transplanted from       January to February.</li>
                  <li>High quality cheroot tobacco is grown is parts of       Madurai district and around Dindigul and Vedasandur area.</li>
                  <li>Natu, cheroot type of variety Oosikkappal is cultivated       in Sentharappatti area of Salem district and in Bhavani and Kurichi blocks       of Erode district.</li>
                  <li>In other parts of the state mostly chewing type of       tobacco are grown.</li>
                  <li>High quality cheroot tobacco is grown in red sandy       gravel soils with irrigation water having total soluble salts is less than       100 ppm.</li>
                  <li>Natu cheroot tobacco are cultivated mostly in red loam       soils with high fertility status.</li>
                  <li>In sandy clay loam soils with irrigation water having       high chloride content, chewing tobacco varieties are grown.</li>
                  <li>In Bhavani block of Erode district and also in some       parts of Coimbatore district chewing tobacco is grown even in black soils       under canal irrigation. Chewing tobacco is also grown in Vedaranyam area       in sandy soils.</li>
                  <li>High quality cheroot tobacco is mostly sun cured, Natu       cheroot tobacco is processed both under sun and shade curing and chewing       tobacco is cured by sun, smoke and pit curing methods.</li>
                  <li>In general in Tamil Nadu, sun cured chewing tobacco is       cultivated around 60-65% of tobacco area. Tobacco area under smoke curing       is about 30% and pit curing is done for the remaining 5% area under       chewing tobacco.</li>
                  <li>The Central Tobacco Research Institute (CTRI) Research       Station at Vedasandur is functioning from 1948 in Tamil Nadu.</li>
                  <li>Because of the continuous research and extension work       of the CTRI research station at Vedasandur, the chewing tobacco yield is       increased from 2000 kg/ha in 1948 to 2800 kg/ha in 1956-59, and 3250 kg/ha       in 1977-78 and 3800 – 4000 kg/ha at present.</li>

                <p><strong>Importance of narcotics</strong><br />
                  <strong>           Tobacco is currently the world’s most  important non-food crop &amp;contributes substantially to the economy of more  than 150 countries.</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                  The tobacco value  chain is most often depicted from the perspective of the cigarette industry and  its health implications. However, from a more integrated perspective, one is  able to appreciate the importance of this sector - as a whole - to the economy  and, in particular, to tobacco growing regions. <br />
                  Tobacco taxation is  the main source of revenue for almost all governments. Few industries are as  complete as the tobacco industry. The tobacco industry generally occupies an  important role within a country’s social and economic context. Even in  countries that do not have cigarette factories, the distribution of tobacco  products is a significant source of economic activity. <br />
                  Though only 0.3% of  the world’s cultivable land is occupied by tobacco plantations – less than half  the land occupied by coffee, for example – it is an important component of the  agriculture industry in many countries and creates more employment per hectare  of cultivated land than any other crop in the world. Price stability is one of  the main attractions for tobacco growers, as well as greater profitability per  hectare. <br />
                  Good cultivation  techniques also help tobacco farmers maximize land efficiency and help  alternative crops grow, better enabling farmers to make the most of their land  all year round.<br />
                  Although  tobacco is grown in more than 100 countries, four countries viz., Brazil,  China, India and the United States account for two thirds of total global  production. <br />
                  Imports  of cigarettes and other manufactured tobacco products deprive many countries of  badly needed foreign exchange. Out of 194 countries surveyed, two-thirds imported  more than they exported in 1998. Ten countries lost more than $100 million,  including Lebanon, Russia and Vietnam. And, of the 62 countries which had a  positive balance of trade in manufactured tobacco products, half earned less than  $20 million, while three (the United States, United Kingdom,<br />
                  and the Netherlands) earned over $1  billion.2 <br />
                  The tobacco  industry estimates that globally, 33 million people are engaged in tobacco cultivation.  However, this figure includes not only farmers who rely entirely on tobacco,  but also farmers who grow other crops besides tobacco, seasonal laborers,  family members and other part-time workers. Of these 33 million, approximately  15 million are in China and 3.5 million in India.<br />
