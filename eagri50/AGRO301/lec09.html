				    <p><strong>Edible Oil Scenario in  India</strong><br />
				      vIndia  is the fourth largest oilseed producing country in the world, next only to USA,  China and Brazil, harvesting about 25 million tons of oilseeds against the  world production of 250 million tons per annum. Since 1995, Indian share in  world production of oilseeds has been around 10 percent. Although, India is a  major producer of oilseeds, per capita oil consumption in India is only 10.6  kg/annum which is low compared to 12.5 kg/annum in China, 20.8 kg/annum in  Japan, 21.3 kg/annum in Brazil and 48.0 kg/annum in USA. Many varieties of  oilseeds along with tree origin oilseeds are cultivated in India. Among these,  the major oilseeds are Soybean, Cottonseed, Groundnut, Sunflower, Rapeseed,  Sesame seed, Copra, Linseed, Castor seed and Palm Kernels. India occupies the  place of pride as the world's largest producer of Groundnuts, Sesame seeds,  Linseeds and Castor seeds. In India, oilseeds are grown in an area of nearly 27  million hectares across the length and breadth of the country. Depending on the  period of cultivation, the oilseeds are classified as <em>'Kharif </em>Crop' and <em>'Rabi </em>Crop'.  The <em>Kharif</em> Crop that is dependent on  the Monsoon is harvested around October-November each year. On the other hand,  the <em>Rabi</em> Crop is harvested around  March-April each year. <br />
				      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The major  oilseeds of India are groundnut, rape seed mustard, linseed, sesame and castor.  Groundnut and rape seed mustard account about 85 percent of the total  production of oilseeds in the country. In other words, groundnut among the  major oilseeds is accounted as about two third, mustard seed one fourth of  linseed and sesame five percent of castor, and three percent of total  production. Soybean, sunflower, safflower, cotton seed and coconut are the  other important oilseeds produced in India.<br />
				      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rapidly  increasing population and changes in dietary habits associated with  urbanization increased demands for food and fuel. Non-true oilseed crops like  cotton, maize, etc. are contributing up to 73% towards the national edible oil  production in the country, while conventional oilseeds (rapeseed &amp; mustard)  rank second and contribute about 18-20% in the domestic edible oil production  (GOP, 2006-07). Edible oil seed crops are classified as conventional (rapeseed,  mustard, sesame, groundnut), non-conventional (sunflower, safflower, soybean)  and non-true oilseeds (cotton, maize and rice bran). Non-true oilseed crops are  contributing upto 70% towards the national edible oil production in the country  whereas the non-conventional oilseed crops share about 6% in the local oil  production (GOP, 2006-07).</p>
                    <p><strong>IMPORTANCE </strong><strong>AND BYPRODUCTS UTILIZATION OF  OILSEEDS</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                      <strong>Groundnut</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Groundnut and its products have wide variety of uses  as roasted nuts and proteinaceous products.</li>
                      <li>Groundnut oil and butter are good cooking material.</li>
                      <li>By products like cakes and meals are animal feed  components contains 40-50% protein, 6-12% fat and traces of vitamins.</li>
                      <li>Groundnut milk acts as supplementary source to  cattle milk.</li>
                      <li>Variety of biscuits and cookies are also prepared  from groundnut.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Sesame</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Sesame oil is used to repel insect</li>
                      <li>Oil is good substitute for olive oil in salads,  pickles and in cooking.</li>
                      <li>Oil is used in manufacture of soaps, paints as  lubricants and illuminants</li>
                      <li>Sesame seed fried and cooked used in soups.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Rapeseed and Mustard</strong><br />
                      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rapeseed  and mustard play an important role in oil seed production, as they are the  major group of winter oilseed crops and contribute upto 18% of the domestic  edible oil production. Due to the presence of higher erucic acid and  glucosinolates, rapeseed and mustard oil is not regular cooking oil.  Glucosinolates are sulfur containing compounds that occur pre-dominantly in  brassica spp. These substances can lower rapeseed cake palatability and thus  produce a range of nutritional disorders in farm livestock.<br />
                      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oilseed  rape (<em>Brassica napus </em>L.) has become one of the most important oil crops  and at present, is the third largest source of vegetable oil all over the  world. Conventional rapeseed and mustard varieties impose health concerns due  to the presence of erucic acid in oil and glucosinolate in meal. Canola has the  advantage over other vegetable oils because it contains lowest content of  saturated fatty acids and moderate content of poly-unsaturated fatty acids.  Canola oil is low in erucic acid (&lt;2% in oil), glucosinolates (&lt;20  micromoles per gram in meal) and has a lower level of saturated fats (only 6%)  than any other vegetable oil. It has a high proportion of un-saturated fats  containing a favorable mix of both mono and poly-unsaturated fatty acids, which  makes it favorite cooking oil.<br />
  <strong>Sunflower</strong><br />
                     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sunflower  is a robust oilseed crop, the seeds of which contain about 20% protein in  addition to 40—50%, oil which has a mild taste, pleasant flavour, good keeping  quality with acceptable amounts of vitamins A, D and E. Hulls obtained during  decortication of sunflower have high fibre content and can be used as a  roughage in certain animal feeds. Alternately, they can be used to produce heat  by burning, as they yield the same amount at heat as lignite coal.<br />
  <strong>Safflower</strong><br />
                      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Large scale  cultivation of safflower, containing 35 to 45 percent oil, has started about 25  years ago in India. Traditionally known as source of dye in ancient India, the  safflower has attained considerable importance as an oliseed crop. It is  cultivated in many states of India and numerous races of this crop are under  cultivation, varying markebly in botanical features and in oil and dye  contents. It is highly branched, herbaceous, thistle like annual, the spinous  variety of which is valuable particularly for oil production. Unfortunately,  being a crop identified for edible oil. The oil content in seeds is the most  important product.  The cake obtained  from decorticated seeds (40% protein) is used for cattle feed while that  obtained from undecorticated seeds is used for manurial purposes (20—22% protein).  The cake does not get rancid, if stored in dry condition. Its application as  manure greatly improves the physical properties of heavy soils. The<br />
                      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;seed and cakes are used as poultry  feed. Safflower flour also contains lignin glycosides which import a bitter  flavour and has cathartic activity. These can be eliminated or reduced to a low  level in the preparation of concentrates. <br />

                    <p><strong>Niger</strong><br />
                      <strong>         </strong>Niger is one of the minor oilseed crops in India  grown on hill slopes and marginal lands mostly in tribal areas. Niger gives  good cooking oil with nutty taste and pleasant odour which can also be used in  cosmetics and perfume industry and for lubrication. Niger contains 85% poly  unsaturated fatty acid mostly comprising of linoleic and oleic acid. Hence it  is good edible oil. The edible oil is pale yellow in colour. Niger oil is used  without any refining. Niger contains 37 to 43% oil. It is good cooking oil.  After extraction of soil, the oilcake contains 24 to 34% protein and 8 to 24%  crude fibres. <br />
