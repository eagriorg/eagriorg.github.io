				<p>India has  been considered as treasure house of valuable medicinal and aromatic plant  species.&nbsp; Ministry of Environment and Forests have identified and  documented over 9500 plant species considering their importance in the  pharmaceutical industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the present context of &lsquo;back  to&nbsp; nature&rsquo;&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; health&nbsp; care, it is relevant  that&nbsp; these&nbsp; valuable plant&nbsp; species&nbsp; are not only&nbsp;  preserved&nbsp; but&nbsp; also their cultivation developed in order to meet the  entire demand of the domestic industries as&nbsp; also&nbsp; to&nbsp; exploit  the bright prospect for&nbsp; export.&nbsp; Shift from collection to  cultivation of medicinal &amp; aromatic plants will also ensure purity,  authenticity and sustainable supply of raw materials required for herbal drugs,  including polyherbals.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Our foreign  exchange earning potential from this group of plants is estimated to be over  3000 million US dollars per annum. Agro-techniques have been developed for  large number of medicinal plants by the State Agricultural Universities. Due to  unorganised&nbsp;marketing arrangements this sector has not exploited the full  potential. A Medicinal Plants Board has been constituted in the Department of  Indian Systems of Medicines &amp; Homeopathy to address all the issues.<strong></strong><br />
<strong>Importance</strong><br />
The diverse  Agro-climatic situations in the Region offer excellent scope for growing  different horticultural crops like fruits, vegetables, spices, plantation  crops, medicinal and aromatic plants. Medicinal and aromatic plants constitute  a major segment of the flora, which provides raw materials for use in the  pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and drug industries. The indigenous systems of  medicines, developed in India for centuries, make use of many medicinal herbs.  These systems include Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and many other indigenous  practices. </p>
                <p>More than  9,000 native plants have established and recorded curative properties and about  1500 species are known for their aroma and flavour. Even in many of the modern  medicines, the basic composition is derived from medicinal plants and these  have become acceptable medicines for many reasons that include easy  availability, least side effects, low prices, environmental friendliness and  lasting curative property.</p>
                <p> India and China are the two major producing  countries, having 40 per cent of the global biodiversity and availability of  rare species. These are well known as the home of medicinal and aromatic crops  that constitute a segment of the flora, and provide raw materials to the  pharmaceutical, cosmetic, fragrance, flavour etc. industries.</p>
                <p>India has  one of the richest ethnobotanical traditions in the world with more than 7000  species of plants found in different agro-ecosystems and used by various  indigenous systems of medicine and industries. Over 95% of the plants used by  the herbal or pharmaceutical industry is collected from wild sources. Given the  alarming rate of loss of biodiversity due to other well-known factors alongside  the indiscriminate collection of wild medicinal plants, there is a real danger  of extinction of many of our medicinal plant species. In the face of serious  threat to biodiversity, it is extremely important to take urgent steps to  conserve and develop medicinal plant genetic resources alongside their cultural  roots in all our diverse agro-ecosystems.</p>
                <p>The  aromatic and medicinal plants such as Patchauli, Stivia, Citronella, Cinnamon  are also being grown in mild tropical areas i.e. plain and foot hills of the  State. Temperate and alpine zones accommodate cultivation of geranium, texus,  ginseng, saffron etc. Mizoram is well known for its exotic orchids and  medicinal and aromatic plants.<br />

                <p><strong>Status</strong> <strong>in  India</strong> <br />
                  The  age old Indian systems of medicine have been neglected mainly because of the  rapid expansion of the allelopathic system of medical treatment. This is  despite the fact that our country has a long history of local health  traditions, which are backed by thousands of scriptures left behind by  practitioners of these systems of medicine. One of the earliest treatises of Indian  medicine, the chakara samhita (1000 BC), mentions the use of 2000 vegetable  herbs for medicinal use. Over 7000 different species of plants found in  different ecosystems are said to be used for medicinal purposes in our country. <br />
  <strong>            </strong>India has been a traditional exporter of medicinal plants  for the past several decades and ranks as one of the foremost supplier of  medicinal plants in the world.  <br />
