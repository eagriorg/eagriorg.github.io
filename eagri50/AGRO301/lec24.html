  <strong>Climatic Requirements</strong> <br />
                  Potato is  basically cool season crop. It grows well from sea level to snow line, where  sufficient moisture and fertile soil are available. It is grown in winter in  plains of India. However, in northern hills, it is grown as summer season crop.  Potato is a long day plant but cultivated as~ day plant. It requires favourable  environmental conditions such as low temperature and short day conditions at  the time of tuberization for rapid bulking rate. About 20 °C temperature is  good for tuber formation and it reduces as the temperature increases.  Tuberization is badly affected at about 300C temperature. At higher  temperature, the respiration rate increases and the carbohydrates produced by  photosynthesis are consumed rather than stored in tuber. High temperatures at  any part of growing period affect the size of leaflets, thereby reducing the  tuber formation. It grows best under long day conditions sunshine along with  cooler nights are essential for reducing the spread of diseases. <br />
  <strong>Soil Conditions</strong> <br />
                  Potato can  be produced on a wide range of soils, ranging from sandy loam, silt loam, loam  and clay soil. Soil for potato should be friable, well aerated, fairly deep and  well supplied with organic matter. Well- drained sandy loam and medium loam  soils are most suitable for potato cultivation. Soil structure and texture has  a marked effect on the quality of the tuber. Light soil is preferred, because  they tend to promote more uniform soil temperatures and make harvesting of the  crop easier. Alkaline or saline soil is not suitable for potato cultivation.  They are well suited to acidic soils (pH 5.0 to 6.5) as acidic conditions tend  to limit scab diseases.<br />
  <strong>Planting  Time</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>In Plains</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Early  Crop</strong>: Third week of  September to first week of October.<br />
                  <strong>Main  crop:</strong> First week of  October to third week of October.<br />
                  <strong>Late  Crop:</strong> Third week of  October to first week of November<br />
                  <strong>II. In Hills</strong> <br />
                  Potato  is planted in hills from the third week of February to second week of April. In  the southern hills near Ootacamund and in Nilgiris, planting is done three  times in a year, i.e. in the month of February, April and September In the  plateau regions of Maharashtra, Bihar Madhya Pradesh, potato is raised in rainy  and winter seasons.. In the Mysore plateau, the summer and winter crop is  planted in April-June and in October-December, respectively. <br />
  <strong>Seed Rate, Methods of Sowing and Spacing</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The seed requirements for a hectare on  the basis of seed size are given below: <br />
                  Large size-  25-30 q/ha; Medium size- 15-20 q/ha; Small size- 10-15 q/ha; Out tubers- 8-12  q/h2:-' Potato is planted mainly by two methods:<br />
  <strong>1. Ridge and Furrow Method:</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>In this method, the ridges are  prepared.The length of the ridges depends on slope of the plot. Too long ridges  and furrows arc not supplied with irrigation water conveniently. The potato  tubers are planted on is let into furrows.<br />
  <strong>2. Flat Bed Method</strong> <br />
                  In  this method, the whole plot is divided into beds of convenient length and  width. The shallow furrows are opened and potato tubers are planted at  recommended distance. The tubers are covered with the original soil of furrows.  When the germination is completed and plants become 10 to 12 cm height,  earthing should be done. Suitable plant spacing in relation to potato seed  grades are given below:</p>

                </div>
                <p><strong>Nutritional requirements and their management:</strong> <br />
                  Soils poor  in organic matter content should be supplied with 250 to 500 q/ha of farmyard  manure or compost during land preparation, preferably a fortnight before  planting. Potato plant is a heavy feeder. When it is grown in medium type of  soils, it needs 100 to 150 kg nitrogen, 80 to 100 kg phosphorous and 80 to 100  kg potassium per hectare. Two - third to three fourth quantity of nitrogen  along with whole quantity of phosphorus and potassium is applied at the time of  planting. Remaining one fourth to one third nitrogen is applied 30 to 35 days  after planting i.e. at the time of first earthing up or when plants become 25  to 30 cm in height either in the form of top dressing or as a foliar feeding.  Spraying of essential micronutrients such as boron, zinc, copper, iron,  manganese, molybdenum etc. is done when crop is showing deficiency symptoms.<br />
  <strong>Intercultural Operations</strong> <br />
                  In potato  crop, both types of weeds are found i.e. broad-leaved weeds as well as narrow  leaved weeds-The use of weedicides in potato crop in general is not essential  because earthing up operation destroy almost all weeds, if some how, weed  plants are growing on ridges, they may be pulled out by hands. Pre- emergence  application of nitrofen @ 1.0 kg a.i./ha or alachlor @.2.0 kg a.i./ha or post  emergence application of propanil @ 1.0 kg a.i./ha may be used ill solution  fom1 (800-1000 litre/ha). Care should be taken while spraying of post-  emergence herbicides that they should not come in the contact to potato plants.  Proper development of tubers depends upon aeration, moisture availability and  proper soil temperature. Therefore, proper earthing up is necessary. Earthing  should be done when the plants are 15 to 22 cm ill height. Generally earthing  is done at the time of top dressing of nitrogenous fertilizers. The ridges  should be high enough to cover up tubers. If necessary, a second earthing may  be done after two -week of the first one. A mould board plough or a ridger may  be used for earthing up in large area.<br />
  <strong>Use of Plant Growth Regulators</strong> <br />
                  Soaking of  potato seed tuber in CCC at 500 mg/l (Schedule and Pandita, 1986), sodium  ascorbate at  100 mg/l (Murti et al..  1975) cytozyme at 5 per cent (Pandita and Hooda, 1979), Singh and Kaur, 1981)  or foliar sprays with ethephon at 400 mg/l (Murti and Banerjee, 1978, Pandita  and Hooda, 1979 a, Sekhon and Singh, 1985), CCC at 25 mg/l or garlic acid at  10-100 mg/l(Kumar and Agarwal, 1978) increased tuber yield. Sidda Reddy (1988)  also obtained higher tuber yield with foliar sprays of mixtallol at 1 or 2  mg/l.<br />
  <strong>Water Management</strong> <br />
                  Before  coming to the planting operation. it should be kept  in mind that the sufficient soil moisture is  available for satisfactory sprouting. If not then light pre-irrigation or just  after planting may be given. The rate of water use is low till 30-35 days after  planting; it means that the first irrigation is essentially done within 30-35  days after planting. However, when soil moisture seems insufficient for  sprouting, intervals of first irrigation should be reduced. Further, irrigation  is done as and when crop needs. As regards method of irrigation in potato, the  furrow method is commonly followed.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting, Yield and Storage</strong> <br />
                  Harvested  potatoes are heaped under shade for a couple of days, so that their skin becomes  hard and soil adhering with them is also separated out. Under good crop  management, 350-450 quintals of marketable potatoes of good quality can be  produced from one hectare land. The sorting operation is the most important, in  that all cut tubers, bruised, injured by insects-pest and disease are removed.  Sorted healthy tubers are graded in to different grades based on diameter of  the tubers reduce the prices in the market. Therefore, such tubers should be  sorted and marked separately. Over sized tubers are great in demand for chips  making. Very small sized tubers are also not remaining unsold. These tubers are  purchased by poor people for making vegetable by partially Cushing them before  cooking. However, both the over sized and under sized are quite unsuitable for  seed purposes. Potatoes can be stored in the cold storage at the temperatures  of 4 to 7oC and relative humidity.<br />
