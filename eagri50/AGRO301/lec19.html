				<p><strong>Area  under cultivation</strong><br />
At present  it is grown on northern districts of Travancore and Cochin, Assam, Maharashtra  and parts of Uttar Pradesh.<br />
<strong>Botanical Name: </strong><em>Cymbopogon  flexuosus</em> and <em>Cymbopogon citrutus</em><br />
<strong>Family: </strong>Poaceae<br />
<strong>Plant distribution:</strong><br />
It is a  perennial grass about 2 to 3m tall with profuse tillering habit having linear  lanceolate leaves. The inflorescence is a highly branched terminal panicle.<br />
<strong>Centre of Origin: </strong>India<br />
<strong>Soil</strong><br />
It  flourishes on a wide variety of soils ranging from loam to poor laterite with  best growth on welldrained sandy-loam soil.<br />
<strong>Climate</strong><br />
The ideal  elevation for commercial cultivation ranges from sea level to 300m. However in  Kerala, it grows well at altitudes between 900 and 1200m, generally on poor  soils along with hillslopes. Lemongrass requires warm and humid climate with  sufficient sunshine and rainfall, ranging from 250-300 cm, uniformly  distributed throughout the year. In the hilly areas of Kerala receiving heavy rainfall,  the plant grows luxuriantly and is harvested more frequently but the oil and  citral content are less as compared to the plants growing in the regions of  less rainfall. Temperature range of 10-330C and sunshine is conducive to the  development of oil in the plant.<br />
<strong>Varieties</strong><br />
<strong>Sugandhi (OD 19)</strong><br />
It is adapted  to a wide range of soil and climatic condition. A red stemmed variety with  plant height 1 to 1.75 m and profuse tillering. The oil yield ranges from 80 to  100 kg per hectare with 85-88 per cent citral under rain-fed conditions.  Aromatic and Medicinal Plants Research Station, Odakkali, Kerala released this  variety.<br />
<strong>Pragati (LS48)</strong><br />
It is a  tall growing variety with dark purple leaf sheath suitable for north Indian  Plains and Tarai belt of subtropical and tropical climate. Average oil content  is 0.63 per cent with 86 per cent. This variety is a clonal selection from OD19  developed at Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow.</p>
                <p><strong>Praman (Clone 29)</strong><br />
                  Evolved  through clonal selection at Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants,  Lucknow and belong to species <em>C. pendulus</em>. It is a medium sized variety  with erect leaves and profuse tillering. The oil yield is high with 82 per cent  citral.<br />
  <strong>RRL 16</strong><br />
                  Average  yield of this variety is 15 to 20 tonnes/hectare/annum giving 100 to 110 kg  oil. Oil content varies from 0.6 to 0.8 per cent with 80 per cent citral.  Evolved from <em>C. pendulus </em>and released for cultivation from Regional  Research Laboratory, Jammu as Jammu Lemongrass.<br />
  <strong>CKP 25</strong><br />
                  A hybrid  between <em>C.khasianum </em>X <em>C.pendulus. </em>Gives 60 t/ha herbage<br />
  <strong>Propagation</strong><br />
  <strong>By Seeds</strong><br />
                  The common  method employed in Kerala State is from seeds. The crop flowers during  November-December and seeds are collected during January-February. For  collection of seeds, the plants are left without harvest as the yield of seeds  from plants subjected to regular harvest is less. On an average, a healthy  plant gives about 100-200 g of seeds. At the time of seed collection, the whole  inflorescence is cut and spread in the sun for drying for 2-3 days. These are  then thrashed and seeds are again dried in the sin. These are finally stored in  gunny bags. The seeds lose their viability if stored for a longer period<br />
  <strong>Raising of Seedlings in Nursery</strong><br />
                  It is  advantageous to raise the plantation through transplanting of seedlings  whenever there is assured source of water. The transplanting of nursery raised  seedlings is found to be superior to direct sowing of seeds. The seeds are sown  by hand on well prepared raised beds of 1m to 1.5m width at the onset of monsoon  and are covered with thin layer of soil. Recommended seed rate is 3-4kg/ha. The  bed should be watered immediately after sowing and care should be taken to  maintain adequate moisture in the soil. Seed germinates in 5-6 days and the  seedlings are ready for transplanting at the age of 60 days.<br />
  <strong>By Rooted Slips</strong><br />
                  For better  quality and yield of oil it is recommended to grow lemon grass by slips  obtained by dividing well-grown clumps. Tops of clumps are cut off within 20-25  cm of the root. The latter is divided into slips and the lower brown sheath is  removed to expose young roots.</p>
                <p><strong>Planting</strong><br />
                  Seedlings  are planted at a distance of 45 cm in rows, 60 cm apart. It is better to plant  on ridges in areas receiving high rainfall. In case of rooted slips one or two  slips are placed into each hole, about 15 cm deep. Deeper planting is dangerous  as the plants may develop root-rot during the rainy season. Slips are transplanted  firmly into the ground. This is done at the beginning of the rainy season. In  northern India, planting by slips may be done in February if irrigation is  available. In such cases, field is irrigated immediately after planting.<br />
  <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
                  Lemongrass  has a high water requirement and frequent irrigations are essential for getting  optimum yield in those areas where rainfall is restricted only to the monsoon.  In northern India, 4-5 irrigations are required during February- June. As the  plant cannot withstand any amount of water-logging, planting on ridges or open  hill slopes is recommended.<br />
  <strong>Manuring &amp; Fertilization</strong><br />
                  It is  recommended to apply 30 kg nitrogen, 30 kg P O and 30 kg K O per ha basal dose  at the time of 2 5 2 planting. Remaining nitrogen (60 kg) can be applied as  top-dressing in 3 split doses during the growing season. In soils having low  fertility levels, the dose of nitrogen should be increased.<br />
  <strong>Intercultural Operations</strong><br />
  <strong>Weed Control</strong><br />
                  Weeding and  hoeing are very important as they affected the yield and quality of oil.  Generally, 2-3 weedings are necessary during the year. In row-planted crops,  inter-operations can be done by a tractor-drawn cultivator or hand-hoe.  Distillation waste of this crop applied as organic mulch @ 3 tonnes/ha is found  effective for controlling weeds in the crop. Among herbicides, Diuron @ 1.5 kg  ai/ha and Oxyfluorfen @ 0.5 kg ai/ha are effective for weed control. Lemongrass  has been found to be a weed smoothing crop. After it is established, it may  inhibit weeds.<br />
  <strong>Intercropping</strong><br />
                  The plant  does not tolerate shade and oil yields were drastically reduced when the crop  is grown under diffused light. However, intercropping of lemon grass in  regularly pruned cinnamon plantation and newly planted cashew fields during  initial 4-5 years is being widely practiced.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting</strong><br />
                  The time of  harvesting affects the yield and quality of the oil. The first harvest is  generally obtained after 4 to 6 months of transplanting. Subsequent harvests  take place at intervals of 50-60 days depending upon the fertility of the soil  and seasonal factors. Under normal conditions, 2-3 harvests are possible during  the first year and 3-4 in subsequent years, depending on the management  practices followed. Harvesting is done with the help of sickles, the plants  being cut close to their bases about 10 cm above ground-level.<br />
  <strong>Yield</strong><br />
                  Depending  upon soil and climatic conditions, plantation lasts on an average, for six  years. The yield of oil is less during the first year. It increases in the  second year and reaches a maximum in the third and fourth years, after which it  declines. For economy, the plantation is maintained only for six years. On an  average, 25 to 30 tonnes of fresh herbage are harvested per hectare per annum  from 4 to 5 cuttings, which yields about 80 kg of oil. Under irrigated  conditions an oil yield up to 150 kg/ha has been recorded. The percentage yield  based on fresh weight varies between 0.2 to 0.4<br />
  <strong>Uses</strong><br />
  <img src="lec19_clip_image002_0000.gif" alt="" width="212" height="326" hspace="12" align="left" />In India, oil of lemongrass is primarily used for the  isolation of citral for manufacturing Vitamin-A. Citral is the starting  material for the manufacture of ionones and is also used in flowers, cosmetics  and perfumes. A small amount of oil is used, as such in soaps, detergents and  other preparations. The spent lemongrass is suitable for making paper. It is  also used as fuel for the distillation of the grass. It is an excellent source  of manure. It is applied either after composting or in the form of ash by  burning. It may be used for mulching coffee. It is a good crop for checking  soil erosion.<br />
  <strong>Post Harvest Technology</strong><br />
  <strong>Distillation</strong><br />
                  The grass  is either distilled afresh or is allowed to wilt for 24 hours. Wilting reduces  the moisture content and allows a larger quantity of grass to be packed into  the still, thus economizing the fuel use. The current method of distillation  adopted in Kerala is primitive and obsolete and gives oil of poor quality, as  it is based on hydro-distillation or direct-fired still. For good quality oil,  it is advisable to adopt steam-distillation. The equipment for distillation  consists of a boiler to produce steam, a distillation tub, a condenser and one  to three separators. The distillation tub is made of mild steel and has a  perforated bottom, on which the grass rests. The tub has a steam inlet pipe at  the bottom. A removable lid is fitted on to the top. Charging and discharging  can be done in perforated cages with iron chains, which can be lowered in the  tub with the help of a chain- pulley block. Different types of condensers are  available, but tubular condensers are better than others. The condenser is  provided with an inlet and outlet by means of which cold water is made to flow  through the chamber to cool the pipes when the distillate flows through them. To  obtain the maximum yield of oil and to facilitate release of oil, the grass is  chopped into shorter lengths. Chopping the grass has further advantages that  more grass can be charged into the still and even packing is facilitated. The  grass should be packed firmly as this prevents the formation of steam channels.  The steam is allowed to pass into the still with a steam pressure from 18 to 32  kg in the boiler. The mixture of vapours of water and lemongrass oil passes  into the condenser. As the distillation proceeds, the distillate collects in  the separator. The oil being lighter than water and insoluble floats on the top  of the separator and is continuously drawn off. The oil is then decanted and  filtered. Small cultivators can use direct-fire stills, but in such cases,  properly resigned stills should be used. These stills are provided with a  boiler at the bottom of the tub. This is separated by a false bottom from the  rest of the tub. Water is poured at the bottom of the tub and grass is charged  in the top portion. In the still, the water does not come in contact with the  grass. The oil is stored in containers, preferably of glass or well-tinned  iron. Containers should completely be filled to exclude any air and protect  from sunlight as they affect the citral content.<br />
