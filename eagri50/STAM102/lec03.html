				<h1>Personal Computer</h1>
				<p>       A  personal computer (PC) is any general-purpose computer whose size,  capabilities, and original sales price make it useful for individuals, and  which is intended to be operated directly by an end user, with no intervening  computer operator.<br /></p>
                  <p align="center"><img width="289" height="218" src="lec03_clip_image002.jpg" /></p>
				<p>This is in contrast to the batch  processing or time-sharing models which allowed large expensive mainframe  systems to be used by many people, usually at the same time, or large data  processing systems which required a full-time staff to operate efficiently.<br />
				  A personal computer may be a desktop  computer, a laptop, tablet PC or a handheld PC (also called palmtop). Software  applications for personal computers include word processing, spreadsheets,  databases, Web browsers and e-mail clients, games, and myriad personal  productivity and special-purpose software. Modern personal computers often have  high-speed or dial-up connections to the Internet, allowing access to the World  Wide Web and a wide range of other resources.<br />
				  A PC may be used at home, or may be  found in an office. Personal computers can be connected to a local area network  (LAN) either by a cable or wirelessly.<br />
				  While early PC owners usually had to  write their own programs to do anything useful with the machines, today's users  have access to a wide range of commercial and non-commercial software which is  provided in ready-to-run form. Since the 1980s, Microsoft and Intel have  dominated much of the personal computer market with the Wintel platform.<br />
				  The capabilities of the personal  computer have changed greatly since the introduction of electronic computers.  By the early 1970s, people in academic or research institutions had the  opportunity for single-person use of a computer system in interactive mode for  extended durations, although these systems would still have been too expensive  to be owned by a single person. The introduction of the microprocessor, a  single chip with all the circuitry that formerly occupied large cabinets, led  to the proliferation of personal computers after 1975. <br />
  <h1><strong>Types of Processors</strong></h1>
  <br />
				 <p> The Central  Processing Unit (CPU) or  the processor is the portion of  a computer system that carries out the instructions of a computer program, and  is the primary element carrying out the computer's functions.<br />
				  <br />
				  AMD processors include AMD Athlon, AMD  Athlon 64, AMD Athlon X2, AMD Athlon Xp, AMD Duron, AMD Sempron, AMD Turion, MD  Opteron and AMD Phenom 1.<br />
				  Moreover, there are various processors  offered by various companies like Macintosh processor. In other words different  processors are used for different types of technology. <br />
  <h1><strong>Booting  of Computer – Warm and Cold Booting</strong></h1><br />
				  <p>Booting of computer is the process of  powering it on and starting the operating system. Booting loads the first piece  of software that starts a computer. Because the operating system is essential  for running all other programs, it is usually the first piece of software  loaded during the boot process.  <br />
				    <br />
  <strong><u>Cold boot</u></strong> is the process of starting  a computer  from a powered-down, or off  state. Cold  boot is also called as hard boot. <br />
  <br />
  <strong><u>Warm boot</u></strong> refers to restarting a computer that is already turned on via the operating  system. Restarting it returns the computer to its initial state. A warm boot is  sometimes necessary when a program encounters an error from which it cannot  recover. On PCs, you can perform a warm boot by pressing the Control, Alt, and  Delete keys simultaneously. On Macs, you can perform a warm boot by pressing  the Restart button.</p>
