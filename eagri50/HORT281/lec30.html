				  (<strong>Syn: Garden beet) (<em>Beta vulgaris </em>L.) (2n = 2x = 18)</strong><br />
				  (Hindi  : <em>Chukandar</em>) Family : Chenopodiaceae<br />
			    <p>Beet root is a popular root crop  grown for its fleshy roots which are used as cooked vegetable, salad and for  pickling and canning.  Young plants along  with tender leaves are also used as pot herbs.   It is very popular in USA.  Beet  root is a rich source of protein (1.7 g/100 g/100 g), carbohydrates (88 mg),  calcium (200 mg), phosphorus (55 mg) and vitamin C (88 mg).  Leaves are rich in iron (3.1 mg), vitamin A  (2100 I.U.), thiamine (110 μ g) and ascorbic acid (50 mg/ 100 g).<br />
  <img width="166" height="221" src="lec30_clip_image002.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="http://the-herb-store.com/catalog/images/beet-root-bsp.jpg" /><strong>Origin</strong><br />
				  Beet root originated from <em>Beta vulgaris </em>L. ssp. <em>maritima </em>by hybridization with <em>B. patula.  </em>Crop has site of origin probably in Europe.  Earlier types were with long roots like that  of carrot.  Beet root, sugar beet and  palak belong to species <em>B. vulgaris </em>and  are cross compatible.<br />
  <strong>Botany</strong><br />
				  Beet root is a biennial, producing a  fleshy elongated hypocotyls and a rosette of leaves in first year and flowers  in second year.  Upper portion of fleshy  root develops from hypocotyls and basal part from tap root.  Concentric rings seen in cross section of  root are as a result of alternate formation of vascular tissues and storage  parenchyma tissues.  Root skin colour  varies from orange red to dark purple red.   Colour of beet root is due to presence of red violet pigments of β  cyanins and a yellow pigment, β xanthin.   It has extensive tap root system and tap root grows as deep as 3m.<br />
  <img width="232" height="203" src="lec30_clip_image004.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="http://www.gardenaction.co.uk/images/beetroot_bolthardy_original_mine2.jpg" />            Rosette leaves develop in a close  spiral, with older ones on outside.   Inflorescence which normally develops in second year is a spike and ears  numerous sessile flowers in clusters of 3-4.   Flowers are bisexual, small, inconspicuous without corolla, but with  green calyx.  It produces abundant pollen  and is wind pollinated.  All breeding,  works are to be conducted under pollen proof conditions using filtered air.<br />
			    </p>
				<p>Fruits  are mostly aggregates formed by cohesion of 2 or more fruits and held together  by swollen perianth (calyx) base forming an irregular dry cork like body called  as ‘seed ball’ or the so called seed.  If  there is a single flower, a single germ seed alone will develop in the seed’.  True seeds are small, kidney shaped and  brown.  Attempts to breed varieties with  monogerm seeds are in progress since thinning is a costly and essential  operation in beet root cultivation.<br />
                  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
            A few of the improved varieties  popular in India are:<br />
<strong>Detroit Dark Red:</strong> Roots perfectly round with smooth uniform deep  red skin; flesh dark blood red with light red zoning; heavy yielder with a  duration of 80-100 days.<br />
<strong>Crimson Globe:</strong> It produces round to flat round  roots.  Outer skin is medium red and  flesh is crimson red without zonations; duration 55-60 days.<br />
<strong>Early Wonder:</strong> Roots flat globular with dark red skin and  dark red flesh and light red zoning.<br />
<strong>Ooty-1:</strong>This TNAU variety has round roots with  blood red flesh colour; yields 28 t/ha in 120 days; it sets seeds under  Nilgiris conditions.<br />
<strong>Crosby Egyptian:</strong>Roots flat globe with  dark purplish red flesh; duration 55-60 days; produces white zoning under warm  weather.<br />
            Madhur, Ruby Queen and Ruby Red are  a few of the varieties marketed by private seed industry.<br />
<strong>Climate</strong><br />
            Beet root is hardy to low temperature  and prefers cool climate.  Though it  grows in warm weather, development of colour, texture, sugar content etc. of  roots is the best under cool weather.   High temperature causes zoning <em>i.e.,</em> appearance of alternate  light and dark red concentric rings in the root.  Extreme low temperature of 4.5-10.0oC  for 15 days will results in bolting.  It  requires abundant sunshine for development of storage roots.<br />
<strong>Soil</strong><br />
            Deep well drained loam or sandy  loams is the best for beet root cultivation.   Heavy clayey soils result in poor germination and stand of crop due to  formation of a soil crust after rains or irrigation.  Roots may be misshaped and will not develop  properly in heavy soils.  Beet root is  highly sensitive to soil acidity and the ideal pH is 6-7.  Beet root is one of a few vegetables which  can be successfully grown in saline soils.<br />
<strong>Land preparation and sowing</strong><br />
            Being a cool season crop, beet root  is raised during winter in plains and as a spring-summer crop in hills by  March-April.  In plains, sowing is practiced  during September-November.<br />
            Land is ploughed to a fine tilth by  thorough ploughing making it loose and friable.   Clods are to be removed completely.   Apply well decomposed farmyard manure at the time of final  ploughing.  Flat beds or ridges and furrows  are prepared.  Water-soaked ‘seed balls’  which contain 2-6 seeds are drilled 2.5 cm deep in rows at spacing of 45-60 x  8-10 cm.  5-6 kg of seeds is required for  one hectare.  Staggered sowing at 1-2  weeks interval ensures steady supply of roots during the season.<br />
<strong>Manures and fertilizers</strong><br />
            On sandy soils, organic manure @ 25  t/ha is recommended.  For an average  soil, 60-70 kg N, 100-120 kg P and 60-70 kg K/ha is recommended.  Entire farmyard manure, half of N and full P  and K should be applied basal at the time of land preparation prior to sowing  and remaining at 30-45 days after sowing.   Nitrate sources of N are preferred to ammonium sources.  Beets have a relatively high boron requirement  and its deficiency causes internal breakdown as black rot or dry rot.<br />
<strong>Aftercare</strong><br />
            Thinning is an essential operation  when more than one seedling germinates from each seed.  Moist soil is essential for seed germination  and for further growth.  Usually 5-6  irrigations are usually given during summer and three irrigations during winter  in North Indian plains.<br />
            Field is usually kept weed free by  light hoeing at early stage of crop.   Swollen roots are also to be covered with soil by earthing up.<br />
<strong>Harvesting</strong><br />
            Medium sized tubers are of great  demand and tubers are harvested after attaining a diameter of 3-5 cm.  Harvesting is done 8-10 weeks after sowing by  pulling the top with hand.  Later tops  are removed, graded and marketed.  In  European countries, where small sized bunches are in demand, tubers are tied in  bundles of 4-6 with their tops.  Over  matured and oversized tubers become woody and crack.  Yield varies from 25 to 30t/ha and the tuber  stores well at 0oC and 90% RH.<br />
<strong>Seed production</strong><br />
            Unlike other root crops, annual  tropical types do not exist in beet root.   All cultivars in beet root are temperate biennial types and seed  production is possible in hills 1400 m above mean sea level.  A low temperature of 4.4 to 7.7oC  for 6-8 weeks is required for flowers to initiate.  Usual method of seed production is root to  seed method.  In this method, seeds are  sown in July and well developed roots are dug out during  November-December.  After selection of  root tubers, top is trimmed without injuring crown.  Then whole tubers of selected plants are  transplanted at a spacing of 60 x 45-60 cm in well prepared fields and  irrigated.  Harvesting is done during  June-July.  Cross pollination is due to  self incompatibility.  Being a cross  pollinated crop, that too wind pollinated, provide an isolation distance of  1000 m for certified seed production and 1600 m for breeder and nucleus seed  production.  Average seed yield is 2.0  t/ha.<br />
<strong>Pests and diseases</strong><br />
            Insect pests like leaf miners, web  worms, semi loopers; fungal diseases like <em>Cercospora </em>leaf spot and downy mildew and viral diseases cause damage in beet root  cultivation.</p>
