				<p align="center"><strong>IMPORTANCE  AND PLANNING OF ORNAMENTAL GARDENS</strong><br />
                  <strong>History and development of gardening  in India</strong><br />
            <p>It is believed that the gardening in  India is as old as its culture. Five to six thousand years before Christ,  gardening was in vogue.  It is understood  that Indians were the first to choose gardening as the proper atmosphere for  meditation.  Gardening has been mentioned  in classical literature of India. Asokavana of Ramayana was believed to be  established with trees, shrubs, ponds, etc.   The use of ‘brindavan’ (landscaped city) and ‘Raja-vanam’ (large park  where kings go for hunting) did find very frequent mention in ancient  literature.  Many trees were considered,  ‘sacred’ to Hinduism e.g. <em>Ficus  religiosa, Saraca indica, Aegle marmelos </em>and<em> Mimusops elengi</em>.  During Bhuddha’s  period (about 563 B.C.) gardening received further encouragement.  Gardening is considered as a source of peace  and solitude. Imitation of nature and improvement over nature were considered  as a primary goal in these types of gardening.   King Asoka could be considered as the Father of road side avenue  planting as he was the first king to order planting of road side avenue trees  in India.  From 6 to 10th  Century gardening received a great deal of encouragement from Indian kings. <br />
            During the time of King Somadeva (11th  Century) and King Hamira (13th Century) gardening developed into a  fine art. The ‘Vanas’ and ‘Ashrams’ gave way to gardens established by kings  and nobles and gardening became virtually and monopoly of the feudals.  The period between the beginning of the 14th  Century to the end of 16th Century showed sudden change in the style  of gardening due to influence of Moghul emperors who ruled India during these  centuries.  King Feroze Shah and King  Baber brought with them the finest art of gardening from their country and the  Mogul style gardens were established in Delhi, Hyderabad, Agra, Kashmir, Lahore  and Pinjore.  Some of these gardens are  still famous to this day, e.g.
				
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Garden at Fatepur Sikri (U.P.) by       King Akbar</li>
				  <li>Moghul garden at Pinjore (Punjab)       by King Fadaikhan</li>
				  <li>Shalimar Bagh at Lahore by Shah       Jahan</li>
				  <li>Taj       Mahal garden in Agra.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>These  Mogul gardens had a distinct style.  They  were laid out near river, or rivulets, slope of a hill or river bank. The  garden may be square or rectangular and paths running parallel to water  courses. Running water is the life and soul of the garden and the water  channels are paved with tiles of brilliant blue colour to reflect the sky and  give the impression of depth. On either side of the central channel or sheet of  water were planted with flowering shrubs, trees, scented flowers like rose and  jasmine. All the mogul gardens had high wall surrounding them. <br />
				  During  the 16th Century when British came to India they introduced the  styles of gardening of England and continental Europe. The first style  developed by the British was the formal or symmetrical style of gardening.  By 18th Century, this style became  monotonous and then informal style or natural gardens began to develop.  The modern gardens, developed during 19th  and 20th Centuries, involved the combinations of the formal and  informal styles. The important features in English gardens are lawn, rockery,  mixed borders of herbaceous perennials, annuals, shrubs, etc.  Lal Bagh at Bangalore, Government Botanic  Garden at Ooty, Sims park at Coonoor and Bryant part at Kodaikanal are examples  of gardens established in British style.  <br />
  <strong>Importance  of gardening</strong><br />
				  The importance of gardening is  realised by every individuals now in the globe. The gardens serve the purpose  of public recreation and education. They serve to refresh the body and the  mind. They are virtually a retreat for the public from the harsh strains and  stresses of public life. Gardens have become essential to modern civilization.  Home gardening is an integral part of family life and it lends itself for the  family to relax and enjoy the nature and beauty of garden. It also helps to  develop some useful hobby and the ‘skill’ in flower and dry arrangements. In  the recent years, landscape architecture has come to play a vital role in the  developments of home, public institutions, public places like bus stand,  railway stations, towns and cities. Landscaping the roadsides on cities and  towns is also given much importance in tropical countries like India as they  provide shade and beauty to that area.   In foreign countries landscaping of homes and public buildings is an  important art and there are professional and qualified landscape architects who  do the job. This field of gardening is slowly gaining momentum in our country  especially in big cities.  The government  has also established many parks and a few Botanic gardens in our country.  In most of the big cities and towns, Agri-  Horticultural societies have been established with the sole objective of  promoting horticulture, more particularly gardening.  These societies organize annual flower shows  and garden competition to have healthy competition among the public to develop  gardening. <br />
  <strong>Scope of ornamental gardening and  landscaping</strong><br />
				  Gardening  which was only an art and science in the earlier days has now emerged as a huge  industry. With the importance and need of gardening in improving and conserving  the environment being strongly felt now, the concept of landscaping and  gardening is growing rapidly. Ornamental gardening and landscaping has expanded  as a multi-faceted industry encompassing activities such as propagating and  rearing ornamental plants, landscaping, production of growing media, pots and  other accessories, etc., generating huge employment opportunities and simultaneously  promoting activities that would improve the environment. <strong>Planning of gardening</strong></p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li><strong>Land:</strong>        Analyzing the soil for the suitability of planting is the most       important beginning to start a thriving garden. After testing the soil,       enrich it with the required nutrients. </li>
				  <li><strong>Plants:</strong> Some forehand knowledge about       plants like, which are hardy plants, which are for hedging, flowering,       shade giving plants etc. Then the knowledge about the plants suited for       dry gardens, clay soils and acid soils will help in planning good gardens.       The selection of plant and styles of garden should be in such a way that       it should look green and variety show that is going to last for a long       time. This can be achieved by using wide range of plants from trees to       shrubs, to climbing plants, flowering ones and ferns, annuals and       perennials.</li>
				  <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Choose plants that are suitable       to the kind of environment and climate conditions of that particular area.       It would be useless and expensive to waste money on plants that will hate       the environment. </li>
				  <li><strong>Styles and Types:</strong> There are several planting       styles from cottage gardens to prairie gardens, from gardens for       commercial purposes to those strictly for personal use. Based on the       different types and styles, you can tackle the job of planting them all       together in a garden, working out which ones will look best where and how       they will compliment each other.</li>
				  <li><strong>Cultural aspects:</strong> Knowledge about preparation of       land, fertilisation, weeding and disease and pests of plants is necessary       to keep the garden productive and for proper maintenance.</li>
