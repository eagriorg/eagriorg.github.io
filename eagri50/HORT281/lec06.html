                    <strong>(Syn: Lady’s finger, Bhindi)</strong><br />
                    <strong>(<em>Abelmoschus  esculentus </em>(L.) </strong><strong>Moench)  (2n = 130)</strong><br />
				  (Hindi:  Bhendi)<br />
			    <p>Okra is predominantly a crop of  tropics and subtropics.  It occupies  fifth position, next to tomato, in area under vegetables in the country with a  production of 33.24 lakh metric tonnes from an area of 3.47 lakh hectares.  The crop is cultivated for its young tender  fruits, used in curry and soups after cooking.   It is a good source of vitamins A and B, protein and minerals.  It is also an excellent source of iodine and  is useful for the treatment of goiter.   Fruit is useful against genitor-urinary disorders, spermetorrhoea and  chronic dysentery.  Fruits are also dried  or frozen for use during off-season.   Dried fruit contain 13-22% edible oil and 20-24% protein and is used for  refined edible oil.  Dry fruit skin and  fibres are used in manufacture of paper, card board and fibres.  Root and stem are used for clearing cane  juice for preparation of jaggery.<br />
  <strong>Origin and distribution</strong><br />
				  Okra originated in tropical and  subtropical Africa. Existence of a large number of related species with wide  variability and dominant characters suggest possible role of India as a  secondary centre of origin.<br />
				  India is the largest producer of  okra in the world. It is also used as a vegetable in Brazil, West Africa and  many other countries. In India, major okra growing states are Uttar Pradesh,  Bihar and West Bengal.<br />
  <img width="215" height="240" src="lec06_clip_image002.gif" align="left" hspace="12" /><strong>Taxonomy and botany</strong><br />
				  Cultivated bhendi belonging to  Malvaceae was earlier placed under <em>Hibiscus  esculentus </em>L. Since its calyx, corolla and staminal column are fused  together and fall down at anthesis (caduceus), it was renamed as <em>Abelmoschus esculentus </em>L. in <em>Hibiscus</em>, calyx <em>is</em> persistent.  Cultivated  bhendi is an annual herb with duration of 90-100 days.  Flowers are bisexual and often  cross-pollinated.  Time of anthesis is  8.00-10.00 a.m.  Dehiscence of anthers  occurs 15-20 minutes after anthesis and is completed in 5-10 minutes.  Pollen fertility is maximum in the period  between one hour before and after opening of flower.  It takes 2 to 6 hours for fertilization after  pollination.  Stigma is receptive at  opening of flower and hence, bud pollination is not effective in okra.  Fruit is a capsule.  Usually fibre development starts from fifth  to sixth day.<br />
				  Most  of cultivated varieties are amphidiploids with 2n=130.  <em>A. esculentus</em> is noted for its  chromosome polymorphism and 2n ranges from 72 to 144. It tolerates addition or  deletion of one or a few chromosomes.   The chromosome number of <em>A  .esculentus</em> is 2n=130 which is evolved by crossing.  A. <em>tuberculatus </em>(2n=58) with <em>A. ficulneus (</em>2n=72).  The F1 developed was subjected to colchicines  treatment to make it an amphidiploid.  <em>A. esculentus </em>(2n=130).<br />
				  Similarly, <em>A. caillei</em>, a  complex polyploidy, can be evolved by colchicines treatment of F1 of cross  between A. manihot and A. esculentus.<br />
				  Four species viz., <em>A. esculentus</em>, <em>A. manihot</em>, <em>A. caillei</em> and <em>A. moschatus</em> include both  cultivated and wild forms.<br />
  <strong>Crop improvement</strong><br />
				  Yellow vein mosaic virus disease being a serious problem in okra  cultivation, concerted effort was made to develop high yielding as well as YVMV  resistant varieties in the country.  With  development of YVMV resistant variety, Pusa Sawani, most of the primitive low  yielding local cultivars has become less significant.  After break down of resistance of Pusa  Sawani, research on virus resistance was intensified at various research  centres in India and it resulted in development of a number of YVMV resistant  varieties.<br />
				  Various methods like plant  introduction (Perkin’s Long Green), single plant selection and pure line  selection from local collections (Pusa Makhmali, Salkeerthi<em>)</em>, selection  from bi-parental crosses (Pusa Sawani from IC 1542 x Pusa Makhmali) and selection  from complex crosses (sel 2 from (Pusa Sawani x Best 1) x (Pusa Sawani x IC  7194) were used.  YVMV resistant variety  Susthira developed at the Kerala Agricultural University is <em>A. caillei.</em>  Pedigree selection in the segregating  populations of resistant YVMV varieties resulted in Hisar Unnat (Sel 2-2 x  Parbhani Kranthi<em>)</em> and Varsha Uphar<em> (</em>Lam selection 1 x Parbhani  Kranthi).  Related wild species were also  utilized in development of YVMV varieties like Parbhani Kranti <em>(A.  esculentus cv.</em> Pusa Sawani x <em>A. manihot ssp. Manihot</em>), Punjab 7 (<em>A.  esculentus cv</em>. Pusa Sawani x <em>A. manihot ssp. Manihot </em>cv. Ghana) and  Arka Abhay <em>(A. esculentus</em> x <em>A. manihot</em> <em>ssp. Tetraphyllus</em>).  MDU 1 and Punjab 8 (EMS 8) were developed  through mutation breeding using gamma rays and EMS respectively.</p>

				<p><strong>Varieties</strong><br />
				  Bhendi  varieties and cultivars differ in growth habit, height of plants, presence of  purple pigmentation on plant parts, length, colour and number of ridges of  fruit etc.  A brief description of  improved varieties developed in the country is given below:<strong></strong></p>

				<p>*  Varieties released / identified by AICRP (Vegetables).<br />
                    <strong>Exploitation of hybrid vigour </strong><br />
				  A large number of seeds in a fruit  and large size of flowers are favourable factors for exploitation of heterosis  in bhendi.  A number of hybrids resistant  / tolerant to YVMV were developed in public and private sectors.  Most of the hybrids were developed by hand  emasculation and hand pollination.  Two  F1 hybrids developed by TNAU are CO.2 and CO.3.<br />
  <strong>CO.2:</strong> AE 180 x Pusa Sawani.  Fruits very long (22-25 cm), thick, 7-8  ridged and light green in colour. Productivity 15-16 t/ha. Susceptible to YVMV.<br />
  <strong>CO.3</strong>:  Parbhani Kranti x  MDU.1. Fruits very long (22-25 cm), thick, 7-8 ridged light <br />
				  Green  in colour.  Productivity16-18 t/ha.  Moderately resistant to YVMV.<br />
  <strong>COBhH  1</strong>: Varsha Uphar x  Pusa A4 (T). Fruits are dark green, long, slender with five ridges. High yield  – 22.1 t/ha. Resistance to yellow vein mosaic virus<br />
  <strong>Climate</strong><br />
				  Bhendi is a typical tropical or  sub-tropical crop and cannot tolerate frost.   Performance is also adversely affected by drought, low night temperature  and shade.  Even though fertilization and  seed set are affected during high rainfall, growth of plant and subsequent  productivity is exceptionally good rainfall areas.  Under high temperature and low humidity,  plant growth is stunted and will be shorter in stature.  Similarly flowers drop when day temperature  exceeds 42oC.<br />
  <strong>Soil</strong><br />
				  Okra prefers loose, well drained and  rich soil.  The ideal pH for growth of  plants is 6-8.<br />
  <strong>Season</strong><br />
				  In areas where winter is mild,  bhendi is grown throughout the year.   Since it cannot tolerate frost and low temperature, only two crops are  taken in plains of North India.  As  kharif crop, seeds are sown from May to July and as a spring summer crop,  sowing is done during February-March.  In  hills of North India bhendi is sown during March-April.<br />
  <strong>Seed rate and spacing</strong><br />
				  During summer, vegetative growth is  relatively less and seeds are sown at a closer spacing of 45 x 20 cm or even  less.  Seed rate required is 18-20 kg /  ha.  During kharif, plant grows  vigorously with more branching and seeds are sown at wider spacing of 60 x 30  cm for branching types and 45 x 30 cm for non-branching types.  Seed rate recommended for kharif crop is 8-10  kg/ha.  For harvesting smaller fruits for  export, three rows planting with a spacing of 20-30 cm between rows and 20 cm  within a row is advantageous.  Distance  between two sets is kept as 60 cm.  This  system has the unique advantage of easiness in inter cultural operations,  harvesting, application of plant protection chemicals, etc.<br />
  <strong>Land preparation and sowing</strong><br />
				  Field is ploughed thoroughly for 2-3  times for making soil to a fine tilth.   Ridges and furrows or raised beds are prepared and dibbling on sides of  ridges or on raised beds sows seeds.   Soak seeds for 6-12 hours before sowing to enhance germination during  summer.<br />
  <strong>Manuring and fertilizer application</strong><br />
				  Apply 20-25 t of farmyard manure as  basal dose at the time of final ploughing.   A dose of 150 kg each of N, P2O5 and K2O  is recommended for Pusa Sawani in the coordinated trials.  NPK recommendation varies from state to state  and a lower dose of 50:8:30 kg N is recommended under Kerala condition.  One third dose of N, full P and K are to be  applied as basal dose.  Remaining N has  to be applied in two split doses, 4 weeks after sowing and at flowering and  fruiting stages.  Split application of N  in soil at every 3rd picking is advantageous for getting high yield,  for increasing number of harvests and to maintain size of fruits towards last  harvests.</p>

                </strong>
                <p><strong>Application of Fertilizers in Tamil  Nadu </strong> <br />
                  Apply  FYM 25 t/ha, N 20 kg, P 50 kg and K 30 kg/ha as basal and 20 kg N/ha 30 days  after sowing.  Apply <em>Azospirillum </em>and <em>Phosphobacteria </em>each at 2 kg/ha mixed in 100 kg of FYM before sowing.<br />
  <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
                  Water stress at flowering and  fruiting stages will drastically influence growth of plants, size of fruits and  yield.  Immediately after sowing, field  is irrigated.  Subsequent irrigation is  given at fixed intervals depending on texture of soil and climate.  In black soils, irrigation is done at 5-6  days interval.<br />
  <strong>Interculture</strong><br />
                  Weed growth should be under control  till crop canopy covers fully.  This is  achieved by frequent hoeing, weeding and earthing up.  Used of weedicides like Lasso (2 kg a.i./ha)  or fluchloralin (1.5 kg/ha) or Metolachlor (1.0 kg a.i./ha) and one hand  weeding at 45 days after sowing was very effective and financially viable under  the All India Co-coordinated trials.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting and yield</strong><br />
                  Harvest fruits when they attain  maximum size but still tender.  Fruits of  6-8 cm long are preferred for export purposes.   This is usually attained by 5-6 days after opening of flower.  Harvesting is done in alternate days with a  knife or by bending pedicel with a jerk.   For harvesting, cotton cloth hand gloves should be used to protect  fingers from stinging effect.  It is  advisable to harvest in morning hours since fruit hairs will be soft.  Sprinkling water on pods during night will  keep them cool and fresh for market.<br />
  <strong>Post-harvest management</strong><br />
                  Fruits after harvesting are graded  and filled in jute bags or baskets or perforated paper cartons and sprinkled  with water.  Pre-cooling of fruits before  packing maintains turgidity of fruits and will save it from bruises, blemishes  and blackening.  This is usually done  before packing fruits in perforated cartons of 5-8 kg before transporting to  refrigerated van for export.<br />
  <strong>Yield   </strong>            6.0  – 8.0 t / ha for spring-summer crop<br />
                  10 – 12.5 t / ha for  kharif crop.</p>
                <h1>Pests  and Diseases</h1>
                <p><strong>Diseases</strong><br />
                    <strong>Yellow Vein Mosaic Virus Disease</strong><br />
                  This  is the most serious disease of bhendi.   Characteristic vein clearing is the typical symptom and yield loss may  be up to 100% depending on stage of occurrence of the disease.  Fruits of virus affected plants turn to cream  or white in colour.  Virus is transmitted  through a whitefly Bemisia tabaci.   Removal of weeds susceptible to mosaic from nearby fields, control of  white fly, uprooting and burying of affected plants, adjusting time of sowing  and cultivation of resistant varieties like Arka Anamika, Arka Abhay, Susthira  etc. are recommended for raising a disease free crop. Recently, a hybrid COBhH  1 has been released from HC &amp; RI, TNAU Coimbatore which is resistant to  YVMV.<br />
  <strong>Cercospora leaf spot</strong><br />
                  This  disease is serious when there is high humidity in atmosphere and is common in a  seed crop.  Sooty, black mouldy growth of  pathogen appear as under surface of leaves and finally leaves dry off and fall  down.  Mature pods are also attacked and  show blackish spots.  Spraying with  Bavistin (0.1 g /1) or Bordeaux mixture at fortnightly interval will control  the disease.<br />
  <strong>Powdery mildew</strong><br />
                  This  is caused by a fungus <em>Erysiphae  chicoracearum </em>under prolonged humid conditions.  White powdery pistules appear on lower  surface of leaves resulting in yellowing and death of leaves.  Spraying of wettable sulphur (2g/l) at  fortnightly interval is recommended for control.<br />
  <strong>Insect Pests</strong><br />
  <strong>Jassids (<em>Amrasca biguttula  biguttula</em>)</strong><br />
                  Wedge  shaped pale green jassids suck sap from undersurfaces of leaves causing  marginal yellowing, cupping and drying of leaves.  Due to intense hopper burn, defoliation also  occurs.  Infestation is serious during  summer.  Prophylactic spray of neem  oil-garlic mixture at fortnightly intervals is advantageous for avoiding pest  incidence.<br />
  <strong>Fruit borer</strong><br />
                  Borer  infestation results in toppling and death of young seedlings, withering and  drying up of individual leaves and central shoot.  Fruits will be damaged severely.  Spray of carbaryl or thiodan or endosulfan or  fenvalerate or cypermethrin or deltamethrin is effective for control of borer.  Summer ploughing and clean cultivation are  also helpful in reducing pest infestation.<br />
  <strong>Nematodes</strong><br />
                  Root knot nematode infects roots  causing galls premature leaf fall, wilting and decline in growth and fruit  production. Symptoms in the field generally appear as well defined  patches.  Crop rotation with non host  plants like wheat, rice and corn should be practiced as a regular measure.  Successive deep ploughing during summer and  soil solorisation gives very good control.   Treating field with nematicides also can be adopted.</p>
                <strong><br clear="all" />
                </strong>
                <p><strong>Seed production</strong><br />
                  For seed production, adjust sowing  in such a way that dry weather coincides with maturation and drying of pods and  incidence of yellow vein mosaic disease is minimum.  Being an often cross-pollinated crop, provide  an isolation distance of 400 m from other varieties.  Field inspection and rouging should be  conducted at pre-flowering, flowering and fruiting phases.  Harvesting of initial two fruits will be  helpful in promoting growth of plants.   Average seed yield is 1.0-1.5 t/ha.        <br />
