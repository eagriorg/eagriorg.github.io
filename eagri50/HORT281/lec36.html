				<p><strong>Scientific Name: </strong><em>Rosa hybrida</em><strong> </strong><br />
                    <strong>Local Name</strong><strong>: </strong>Gulab<strong> </strong><br />
                    <strong>Hindi Name</strong><strong>: </strong>Gulab <br />
                    <strong>Family:</strong><strong> </strong>Rosaceae<strong> </strong><br />
                    <strong>Origin  and History</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Rose is also mentioned in the Bible  and is believed to be known before the Bible era. According to archaeological  findings, the Palestinians cultivated roses before the birth of Christ.&nbsp;  Rose is surely very much steeped in history. It is the national flower of  England, and some American States adopted rose as their emblem. It is assumed  that some of the important rose species were hybridized in nature and the  present day improved forms have been evolved/small over centuries. In fact,  Crimson China Rose is considered as the father of modern roses. In the early  nineteenth century itself, one or two hybrids closely allied to <em>R. chinensis </em>were introduced to Europe from China. These were actually hybrids  between&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>R. odorata</em> and <em>R. gigantea.</em> La France was the  hybrid Teas rose, by M. Guillot of France and was developed out of open  pollination.<br />
				  However, out of over 120 species of roses distributed in  the old as well as the new world, only eight species have played a major role  in the development of the modern garden roses. <br />
  <strong>Area  and Distribution</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Roses are being cultivated from  ancient times in France, Cyprus, Greece, India, Iran, Italy, Morocco, USA and  Bulgaria for production of perfume. In India, several species are found growing  wild mostly in the Himalayan ranges. Their cultivation is concentrated at  Aligarh, Kannauj, Ghazipur, Ballia and Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh, at Haldighati  in Rajasthan, Chandigarh and in Tamil Nadu in a total area of about 8,000 ha.  The major rose producing areas are Karnataka, Maharashtra, Punjab, Uttar  Pradesh, Delhi and Chandigarh, while in Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh,  Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal they are grown to a  limited extent.<br />
  <strong>Uses  / Nutrient Values</strong><br />
				  The rose, because of its place  amongst the flower crops and is one of the oldest of fragrant flowers to be  cultivated by man. Its different types having beautiful flowers of exquisite  shape, sizes, bewitching colours and most delightful fragrance has made it an important  flower for its varied uses.&nbsp; Most important uses of flower are given  below.<br />
  <strong>Cut  flower</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Roses are of foremost commercial  importance and cut roses have the highest demand throughout the world and year  round. The cut flowers are used for vase and table decoration.<strong> </strong><br />
  <img width="589" height="224" src="lec36_clip_image006.gif" /><strong> </strong></p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Garden  Display</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Roses are also the most important  perennial garden plants in almost all parts of the world. Roses are not only  hardy, the variation in growth and many forms of flowers having numerous  colours have made them the suitable garden plants for different uses. They can  be used as bushes, standards, climbers, hedges and edges, hangers and in rock  gardens.<br />

				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Perfume  and allies products</strong><br />
                  <strong>Rose  water</strong> <br />
				  Rose water in also an important  commercial product from rose petals. It is used as a perfume and in medicines  and confectionary. In has the property of cooling the body and is often used in  eye lotions and eye drops for  its soothing qualities. It is also used in drinking water and sprinkled on the  guests at weddings, feasts and other social functions.<strong> </strong><br />
                  <strong>Rose  oil</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Rose oil is important commercial product obtained from  rose petals. Apart from sweet fragrance, it has medicinal property and is often  used in Ayurveda. Bulgarian rose otto is largely used in perfuming soaps and  cosmetics.<strong> </strong><br />
                  <strong>Gulkand</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Rose petals are also preserved for direct consumption, by  making gulkand which is prepared by pounding equal proportions of petals and  white sugar. It is considered both as tonic and laxative.<br />
                  <strong>Pankhuri</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Dried rose petals are known as pankhuri which is  occasionally used for preparing sweetened cold drinks.<strong></strong><br />
                  <strong>Gul-roghan</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>It is rose hair oil prepared from rose petals by  effleurage with wet sesamum seeds.<strong></strong><br />
                  <strong>Source  of Vitamins</strong></p>
				<p>Rose  hips are very good sources of ascorbic acid, every 100 g of rose hip syrup  contains 150 mg of ascorbic acid compared with only 50mg present in fresh  orange juice, 20 mg in tomatoes and 5 mg in apples. <br />
                  <strong>Other  uses</strong><br />
            Rose are also use for making  pot-pourri, conserves, rose vinegar, rose petal wine, jams, jellies etc.<br />
<strong>Botanical  Description</strong><br />
<img width="611" height="252" src="lec36_clip_image004.gif" />            </p>
				<p>The  stem is prickly. The leaves are alternate and pinnately compound. The oval  leaflets are sharply toothed. The fleshly berry like fruit is known as hip.  Roses have a determinant inflorescence that may assume corymbs, paniculate or  solitary form.<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;Climate </strong><br />
                    <strong>Temperature</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Temperature is an important factor regulating the growth  of rose plant. Plants are planted at a place where flower yield was highest in  plants kept at night temperature between 15 to 18°C and day temperature of 20  to 25°C. During winters, because of the low temperature the quality of flowers  is good.<br />
                    <strong>Light</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>A light duration lesser than 12 hrs leads to lower number  of flowers and the flowers are of inferior quality too.<br />
                    <strong>Humidity</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Humidity plays an important role in the incidence of  pests and diseases affecting the growth and flowering. In case of higher  humidity in the atmosphere, water drops accumulate on the rose leaves which if  remain over there for a longer period leads to many fungal diseases. Certain  diseases like mildews are associated with relative humidity.<br />
                    <strong>Season  in which the crop is grown</strong><br />
                  It can be grown throughout the year.  The best planting time is between September and October in plains &amp; in the  hills it is during October-November or February-March.<br />
                    <strong>Growing  of roses under open conditions</strong><strong> </strong><br />
				  Roses for local market and for  preparing different products are grown under open conditions. The details are  as follows:<br />
                  <strong>Soil  requirement and preparation</strong><br />
				  Preparation of soil is the key to  success in roses. Although any soil is good for rose cultivation provided it  has proper drainage. The ideal soil should be medium loam having sufficient  organic matter, with a pH of 6.0 and 7.5. The soil should have a fine tilth up  to a depth of 50 cm and should have a good drainage facility. The soil should  be free from gravel, stones, brick pieces and other foreign material and  exposed to sun for at least a week. <br />
				  If the soil is deficit of organic  matter then 10-12 per cent of additional organic matter may be added to it.  Upon land preparation, beds/ plots of 1- 1.5m wide and 30-40m long should be  prepared. <br />
                  <strong>Planting  Distance</strong><br />
				  The planting distance depends on the  types of roses and location. For cut flower production, a spacing of 60 x 30 cm  is recommended. Normally roses are planted at 60 x 60 cm spacing.<br />
                  <strong>Varieties </strong><br />
				  There are different classes of roses  according to the type of flowers they bear:<br />
                  <strong>(A)</strong><strong> Hybrid Tea</strong><br />
				  This is the most important class of  roses. The flower buds of this class are longer and look beautiful. The flowers  of this class are slow opening and hence can be kept in vases for a longer  time. The flower spikes are also longer. Flowers of wide range of colours are  available in this class but red, orange, yellow and some other dark colours are  more preferred in the market.<br />

				  Gladiator,  Queen Elizabeth, Bull’s Red, First Red, Happiness, Grand Gala, Confetti, etc.<br />
                  <strong>Preparation  of Field</strong><br />
                  Beds are prepared for the  cultivation of roses. If the soil is light and proper drainage is there, the  planting can be done even without making beds but if the soil is heavy and  proper drainage is not there, raised beds (40 cm above the ground) should be  prepared. Pits must be dug before the onset of rain so that the soil may settle  down. Pits of 20-30 cm wide &amp; 30 cm deep should be prepared and likewise  the beds should be prepared. Care should be taken that the top soil should  remain on the top.<strong></strong><br />
                  <strong>Propagation</strong><br />
                  <strong>Commercial method of propagation is by  cutting and budding.</strong><br />
                  <strong>a) Cutting       </strong><br />
				  Scented roses are mainly propagated through  cuttings. Hard wood Cuttings in case of polyanthas, climbers, ramblers and soft  or semi hardwood cuttings for miniatures are used. Cuttings are collected from healthier  plants with 15-20 cm length and 3-4 nodes. Cuttings are treated with IAA, BA  100ppm. Cuttings are planted in mist chamber for easy and quicker rooting.<br />
                  <img width="203" height="237" src="lec36_clip_image006.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="cuttings1" /><img width="344" height="237" src="lec36_clip_image008_0000.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" /><strong> </strong></p>

				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>B) Budding    </strong><br />
				  Hybrid  and Floribunda roses mainly propagated through budding. ‘T’ budding is the  common method. Root stocks used are R<em>.  multiflora</em> (Briar root stock), <em>R.  indica </em>var<em>. odorata, R. bourboniana, R. laxa, R.  canina </em>and <em>R. noisettiana.   </em><br />
				  When  a rose plant comes into flower small swellings are visible between the stem and  stalk of the leaf. Select the eyes which are plump and not started to elongate  and grow. Cut off the portions of the branch with the eyes selected is called  as 'bud wood' with a budding knife remove a shield shaped piece of the bark and  the eye. The Root stock should be kept ready by cutting the branches and side  shoots which are not required. Make a sharp horizontal cut at a suitable height  in the stock and then make a vertical ' T ' shaped cut in the stem of the  stock. The 'eye 'should point towards the top and is tied with fibre. <br />

				<p align="left"><strong>Preparation of Beds and pits</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>The beds or pits for planting are  prepared at least a month before the date of planting. The preparation of beds  may be taken up during May or June so that the soil gets a thorough exposure to  sun and air, and during the rainy season it gets a chance to settle down before  planting. The beds are prepared to a depth of 60-75 cm and a trench of 45-60 cm  across is dug to 30 cm depth. The trench is again dug and forked. While forking  a basketful of well-rotten cow dung manure and a double handful of bone meal may  be mixed in the soil. <strong></strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>If the soil of the bed is heavy clay  with poor drainage, the beds are raised to a level of 5 - 10 cm above the  ground. To improve the heavy clay soil, hydrated lime @ 1.5 kg/sq.m is forked  30 cm deep into the soil at the bottom of the bed. Gypsum @ ½ kg /sq.m can also  be applied. If the soil is light or sandy, plenty of compost or FYM can be  added to improve the water-holding capacity. Pits of size 45 cm 3 can be dug  while planting in pits.<u></u><br />
                    <strong>Season</strong><br />
                  Planting can be avoided during hot  summer and heavy rains. In plains roses can be best planted during Sep-Oct  after the cessation of the rains. In hills, planting fan be done during  Oct-Nov/ Feb-Mar. depending upon the temperature but the former season is more  suited.<u></u><br />

  <strong>Planting</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Before planting, the top 30 cm  soil from the pits should be removed. The plant along with the earth ball may  be gently lowered into the pit, keeping the main stem in the centre of the pit.  The bud union point where the scion joins the stock is kept just above the  ground level. Generally, in temperate countries the bud union point is kept  below the ground level. While planting it is necessary to spread out the roots  evenly. The soil is returned to the pit and firmed towards the center. The  plant must be watered copiously immediately after planting.<br />
  <strong>After  care</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The newly planted roses require  frequent watering in the beginning. After that they may be watered once in five  days during summer, and once in ten days during winter. If the soil is sandy,  more frequent watering may be necessary. On the other hand if the soil is heavy  and retentive of moisture the watering interval may have to be increased. Care  should be taken to avoid ‘wet feet’, i.e. to avoid stagnation of water too long  in the beds or near the base of the plants as it is harmful to the roots.  Suckers originating from the root stock must be removed frequently to prevent  the loss of vigour of the plants.<br />
  <strong>Manuring</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>After pruning basins formed  around the plant sand manures are applied 10-15 cm depth.</p>

                      Flood irrigation is given at 10 days interval  depends upon the soil and climate. Avoid irrigation immediately before and  after pruning.<br />
                      <strong>Weeding</strong><br />
                      Mulching 2 to 4 inches of organic material like wood  chips if found to reduce annual weeds and make hand weeding easier. Manual  weeding is effective. Hoeing and roguing is also effective. Effective control of broad leaved  weeds by spraying with 2,4-D, at the rate of 2 kg/600 l of water/hectare 25–30  days before flowering followed by cultivation of soil to a depth of 6-10 cm. <br />

                    <p><strong>Time of pruning</strong><br />
			        Exactly  45 days prior to the date of requirement of flowers during October-December.  Pruning is necessary when the yield and quality declines.</p>
                 
				    <p><strong>Method </strong><br />
				      1st   Year:<u> </u>Cut back the shoots to four  developed buds remain. Allow the lateral shoots.<br />
				      2nd  Year: Retain all strong shoots and remove weak and diseased shoots. Cut back  the strong shoots to 4-5 buds.<br />
				      3rd  Year:<u> </u>Cut back vigorous shoot to half of its growth.<br />
                      <strong>Rejuvenation</strong><br />
				      After  5-6 years the plants are to be rejuvenated. Cut back all the main branches at  15-20 cm from the base. Apply Bordeaux paste over cut ends to prevent diseases.<br />
                      <strong>Harvesting</strong><br />
                      <strong>            </strong>Flowering starts from 1st  year onwards. Economic yield 2nd to 10th year. Flowers  are harvested when the flower buds are in half open stage. For cut flowers,  they are harvested at tight bud stage with long stalks.<br />
                      <strong>Handling</strong><br />
                      <strong>            </strong>As soon as the flowers are harvested,  the stems are harvested the stems are lowered in to clean buckets containing  water with preservative. The flowers are then cooled down to 2-4 0 C  for 5-6 hours. The flowers are graded according to the length of the flower  stalk. It varies from 40-110cm depending on the variety and packed 20 per  bunch. <br />

                      <strong>Pest management</strong> <br />
                      <strong>Aphids </strong><strong>(<em>Macrosiphum rosae</em>)</strong><br />
				      The incidence is more in the months  of January-February on leaves and flower buds.&nbsp; These are small, black in  colour with green tinge. The young and adult both suck the sap from the young  twigs, buds and flowers. They suck the cell sap, discolour the leaves and  affect flower buds which fall and lose their beauty. This can be effectively  controlled by spraying 0.1% Malathion or Metasystox (0.1-0.2%) or Rogor  (0.1-0.2%).&nbsp; <br />
                      <strong>Red  scale </strong><strong>(<em>Lindigapsis rosae</em>)</strong><br />
				      It  is very serious pest of roses which attack mostly in August and September. The  branches are covered with reddish-brown encrustations under which the insect  sucks the juice of the plants. These pests can be controlled by spraying  Malathion (0.1%) or Parathion (0.25%) in April and again in October.<br />
                      <strong>Chaffer  beetles </strong><strong>(<em>Onycetonia varsicolor</em>)</strong><br />
				      The adults of these beetles appear in August-September  and cut away the leaves. This can be controlled by Monocrotophos (1ml/l) or  Dimethoate (1.5 ml/l).<br />
                      <strong>Disease Management </strong><br />
                      <strong>Dieback </strong><strong>(<em>Diplodia rosarum</em>)</strong><br />
				      This is a very serious disease of  roses and appears after pruning. The drying up and blackening of pruned shoots  start from top to downwards. The stems become black and die. At the point where  dry and healthy twigs meet, there appears brown lining and also black spots  appear at these places. The conditions favourable for the prevalence of the  disease include: application of large fertilizers and manure, excessive  irrigation and poor drainage facility, incidence of stem borer, continuous  incidence of mites, less light penetration. For its effective control, the  infected portion should be dehisced and burnt and the cut ends should be  painted with Chaubattia paste (4 part Copper Carbonate + 4 part Red lead +  5&nbsp; parts linseed oil) or Bordeaux paste, application of optimum dose of  fertilizer and by facilitating proper drainage or spray of 3g/ litre of Copper  oxychloride (50%).<br />
                      <strong>Black  spot </strong><strong>(<em>Diplocarpon rosae</em>)</strong><br />
				      This disease appears in during the  humid months. Conspicuous circular black spot (less than 1 cm) with fringed  margins appear on either side of leaf; leaves become chlorotic, dry up and  prematurely drop. It can be easily controlled by spraying Carbendazim (1g/litre  of water) or&nbsp;Captan (0.2%) fungicide at fortnightly intervals.<br />
                      <strong>Powdery  mildew </strong><strong>(<em>Sphaerotheca pannosa </em>var<em>.  rosae</em>)</strong><br />
				      It is a serious disease that occurs  when days are warm &amp; nights are cool. Young growing shoots and leaves are  covered with white powdery growth. Infected leaves turn purplish and drop.  Flower buds may fail to open. It can be checked by removing all the infected  leaves at the time of pruning so that the source of infection is damaged or  dusting with 80% Sulphur or spraying 0.1% Kerathane fungicide at fortnightly  interval.<br />
                      <strong>Post Harvesting </strong><br />
				      After harvesting the flowers they  are dried on floor under shade for 2-3 days. Upon drying, the seeds are  separated by hammering the flowers and the flower straw is separated out by  winnowing of the hammered flowers. The seeds are thoroughly cleaned and graded  before packing in poly bags or cloths bags, and are stored in cool places. The  moisture contents of the seeds must be examined before the packing.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

                    <p><strong>Extraction  of Oil and Quality Control</strong><br />
	                  All parts of <em>Tagetes patula</em> contain essential oil, which can readily be extracted by steam distillation.  The oil has a pronounced odour and acts as a repellent to flies. It has been  reported that 1-limonene, ocimene, 1-linalyl acetate and 1-linalool have been  extracted from <em>Tagetes erecta.</em> While evaluating the different species  for essential oil contents, <em>T. signata</em> contained higher essential oil  (4.25 of dry matter) of very good quality which can be used in perfume  industry.<br />
                      <strong>Marketing,  Distribution and Transportation</strong> <br />
	                  Crop has a good demand in decoration, garlands, loose  flower and religious function etc. So can be marketed to major/ big cities  where these can be supplied to hotels, institutions, etc. For garlands  distribution distributed to the market flower should be packed in bamboo basket  which should be covered under moist muslin cloth.<br />
                      <strong>Pinching</strong><br />
	                  Apical  portion of shoot if removed early, a large number of axillary shoots arise  resulting in well shaped bushy plants bearing more number of uniform flowers.  The removal of shoot apices 40 days after transplanting enhances the flower  yield.<br />
