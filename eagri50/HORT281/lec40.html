				<p><strong>Origin and History</strong><br />
				  Marigold  is native of Central and South America, especially Mexico. From Mexico it  spread to different parts of the world during early part of the 16th century.  The name <em>Tagetes</em> was given after Tages, a demigod, known for his beauty.  African marigold was first introduced into Spain early in the 16th century and  became popular in Southern Europe. Another well known type of marigold i.e.  French marigold (<em>T. patula</em>) followed a similar route from Mexico to that  of African type.<br />
  <strong>Uses/Nutrient Value</strong><br />
				  Marigold  is grown as an ornamental crop for loose flowers as well as a source of pigment  for poultry feed. Flowers are sold in the market as loose or after making into  garlands. Other than loose flower, it can also be used as cut flower. Marigold  is used especially for beautification and also in landscape plans due to its  variable height and colour of flowers. It is highly suitable as a bedding plant  purpose in herbaceous border and shrubbery. French marigold is ideal for  rockeries, edging, hanging baskets and window boxes.<br />
				  Leaf  paste is used externally against boils and carbuncles. Leaf extract is a good  remedy for ear ache. Flowers extract is considered as blood purifier, a cure  for bleeding piles and is also a good remedy for eye disease and ulcers. The  essential oil present in different species of <em>Tagetes</em> can find use in  the perfume industry. <br />
  <strong>Area &amp; Distribution</strong><br />
				  Cultivation tends to be  located close to big cities like Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, Mysore, Chennai,  Calcutta and Delhi. The estimated area on which flowers are grown in India is  about 1,10,000 hectares. Major growing states are Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West  Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. Traditional flowers, including  marigolds, occupy nearly two thirds of this area. In northern India in Himachal  Pradesh, small scale farmers are growing marigold and other flower crops for  garlands and decoration. <br />
  <strong>Botanical  Description</strong><br />
  <strong><em>Tagetes  erecta</em></strong><strong> (African marigold)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />
  <img width="203" height="159" src="lec40_clip_image002.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="http://www.greenscenelandscape.com/images/Plants/Tagetes_erecta.jpg" /><img width="202" height="158" src="lec40_clip_image004.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="http://proplanta.ro/natural-resources/craitesite.jpg/image_preview" /><img width="201" height="159" src="lec40_clip_image006.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="http://pics.davesgarden.com/pics/2006/08/28/McGlory/11a58f.jpg" />The African marigold<strong> </strong>plant is hardy, annual; about 90 cm  tall erect and branched. Leaves are pinnately divided and leaflets are  lanceolate and serrated. Flowers are single to fully double with large globular  heads. The florets are either 2-lipped or quilled. Flower colour varies from  lemon yellow to yellow, golden yellow or orange. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong><em>Tagetes Patula</em></strong><strong> (French marigold)</strong><br />
                    <img width="203" height="161" src="lec40_clip_image008.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /><img width="196" height="159" src="lec40_clip_image010.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="http://ecopharm.sangu.ge/teqn/MEDPL/SURAtEBI/sur8/xaverda/Tagetes_patula_nana_Hybr_Carmen_BotGardBln0906b.jpg" /><img width="202" height="161" src="lec40_clip_image012.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_HyG4qYcYV1Y/ST4wMRYSiUI/AAAAAAAAfx4/TdEmoJW2A50/s800/kur-stu2264.jpg" />The French marigold is a  hardy annual, about 30 cm tall, forming a bushy plant. Foliage is dark green  with reddish stem. Leaves are pinnately divided and leaflets are linear  lanceolate and serrated. Flowers are small, either single or double borne on  proportionately long peduncles. The flower colour varies from yellow to  mahogany red.<br />
                    <strong>Climatic Requirement</strong> <br />
				  Marigold  requires mild climate for luxuriant growth and flowering. Mild climate during  growing period (14.5°-28.6°C) greatly improves flowering while higher  temperature (26.2°-36.4°C) adversely affects flower production.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
  <strong>Soil Requirement</strong><br />
				  Marigold  is adaptable to different types of soil conditions and thus can grown  successfully in a wide variety of soils. However, a deep, fertile, friable soil  having good water holding capacity, well drained and near to neutral in  reaction (pH 7.0 – 7.5) is most desirable. An ideal soil for marigold  cultivation is fertile and sandy loam.<br />
  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
  <strong>Tagetes erecta (African marigold)</strong><br />
				  Giant  Double African Orange, Giant Double African Yellow, Crackerjack, Climax,  Doubloon, Golden Age, Chrysanthemum Charm, Crown of Gold, Spun Gold. <br />
  <strong>Tagetes patula (French marigold)</strong><br />
				  Red  Brocade, Rusty Red, Butter Scotch, Valencia, Succana.<br />
  <strong><em>Tagetes  tenuifolia</em></strong><strong> </strong><br />
				  Golden  Gem, Lulu, Pumila, Ursula. However, in the market  mostly orange coloured varieties are preferred. <br />

				<p><strong>Field Preparation and  Sowing</strong> <br />
                  <strong>Preparation of Field</strong><br />
				  Nursery  beds are thoroughly prepared by digging and incorporating well rotten FYM.  Before sowing the seeds, Malathion dust should be dusted on outer side of  nursery beds to avoid ants. <br />
                  <strong>Planting Material and  Propogation</strong><br />
			    Marigold  is mainly propagated by seeds, besides; it can also propagated by cuttings.  Crop raised from seeds is tall, vigorous and heavy bloomer. </p>
				<p>For raising seedling for  one hectare, about 1.0 kg seed is required.&nbsp; For raising seedlings seeds  can be sown in pots, seed boxes or on flat or raised nursery beds.&nbsp;<br />
                  <img width="511" height="184" src="lec40_clip_image003.gif" /> </p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Seeds  should be sown thinly and be covered with light soil or sand or sieved leaf  mould and watering should be done by fine nose. For cutting method, 6-10 cm  long cuttings are made from the apical portion of the shoot and treated with  root promoting hormones like IAA and IBA. Cuttings planted in sand or  vermiculite root easily and rooted cutting are transferred in bed or pots for  flowering.&nbsp;<br />
                    <strong>Time of Transplanting</strong><br />
				  Mid  July, mid October and February-March are suitable time for transplanting. At  the time of transplanting they should of 7 to 10 cm height and bear 3-4 true  leaves. Transplanting should be done in well prepared land in the evening  hours.<br />
                  <strong>Spacing</strong><br />
                  <em>            Tagetes  erecta</em> require 40 × 30 cm spacing while <em>T. patula</em> require 20 × 20 cm  or 20 × 10 cm spacing for high yield.<br />
                  <img width="281" height="196" src="lec40_clip_image005.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /></p>
				<p>&nbsp; </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Nutrient Management</strong>          <br />
				  FYM is given @ 50 tones/ha at the time of field  preparation. In African and French marigold application of 400 kg N, 200 kg P  and 60 kg K per hectare should be done. <br />
				  Nitrogen should be given  two or three time during growth period.<br />
  <strong>Water and Irrigation  Management</strong><br />
				  The  frequency and quantity of water mainly depends upon factors like soil and  season. In lighter soil, more frequent irrigation is required than heavy soil.  Weekly irrigation is necessary from September-March in sandy loam soil. During  summer months from April to June, frequent irrigation at an interval of 4-5  days is required.<br />
  <strong>Weed Management</strong><br />
				  In  marigold production, control of weeds is an important operation. In India, 3-4  manual weeding are required for entire period. Chemical weed control is also  recommended.<strong> </strong><br />
  <strong>Pest Management</strong><br />
  <strong>Red spider mite </strong>(<em>Tetranychus</em> sp.) <br />
				  These  mites sometime appear on the plant near flowering time. Plants give dusty  appearance. It can be controlled by spraying Metasystox 25 E C, or Rogor  or&nbsp; Nuvacron 40 E C or Kethone @ 1 ml/l of water.<br />
  <strong>Hairy caterpillar </strong>(<em>Diacrisia oblique</em>)<strong> </strong><br />
				  This  caterpillar eats away foliage. This caterpillar can be controlled by Nuvan or  Thiodan at 1 ml/l of water.<br />
  <strong>Disease Management</strong><strong> </strong><br />
  <strong>Fungal diseases </strong><br />
  <strong>Damping off</strong><br />
				  It  is caused by <em>Rhizoctonia solani</em> and appears as brown necrotic spots  girdling the radicle, later on extends to plumule and pre-emergence mortality.  When infected seedlings are pulled, the root system appears fully or partially  decayed. Seeds should be treated with Captan @ 3 g or Carbendazim @ 2.5 g per  kilogram of seeds before sowing.<strong> </strong><br />
  <strong>Collar rot</strong><br />
				  It  is<strong> </strong>caused by a number of pathogens and common ones are <em>Phytophtora</em> sp.<em> Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium</em> sp. Collar rot is caused either in  nursery or in grown-up plants. It can be prevented by soil sterilization or by  using healthy seedlings.<br />
  <strong>Flower bud rot</strong><br />
  <strong>&nbsp;           </strong>It  is caused by <em>Alternaria dianthi</em>. The disease mainly appears on young  flower buds and results in dry rotting of buds. Symptoms are less prominent on  mature buds but these buds fail to open. To control this disease regular  spraying of the crop with Dithane M- 45 @ 0.2% should be followed.</p>
				<strong><br clear="all" />
                </strong>
                <p><strong>Powdery mildew</strong><br />
                    <em>            Oidium  sp.</em> causes powdery mildew in marigold. Whitish,  tiny, superficial spots appear on leaves, later on the whole aerial parts of  the plant is covered with whitish powder. The disease can be controlled by  spraying with Karathane (40 E C) @ 0.5% or dusting with sulphur powder at  fortnightly intervals.<strong> </strong><br />
                    <strong>Plucking-Harvesting</strong><br />
                    <strong>Harvesting</strong> <br />
                  Marigold  flowers are plucked when they have attained full size. Plucking of flowers  should be done in cool hours of the day. The field should be irrigated before  plucking so that flowers keep well for a longer period after harvest. Plucked  flowers are collected in polythene bags or bamboo baskets for carrying to  markets.<strong> </strong><br />
  <img width="319" height="221" src="lec40_clip_image007.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /> </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Yield</strong><br />
                  The  yield of flowers in African and French marigold not only varies with cultivar  but also cultural practices including planting, spacing and fertilization  showed a marked variation in flower number from 6 to 8 millions and from 1.5 to  2.5 millions per hectare, in French and African marigold, respectively, the  corresponding ranges of variation in the weight of flowers were 8 to 12  tonnes/ha in French marigold and 11 to 18 tonnes/ha in African  marigold.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
                  <strong>Post Harvesting</strong> <br />
                  <strong>Postharvest processing,  grading, packing and storage</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;          After  harvesting the flowers they are dried on floor under shade for 2-3 days. Upon  drying, the seeds are separated by hammering the flowers and the flower straw  is separated out by winnowing of the hammered flowers. The seeds are thoroughly  cleaned and graded before packing in poly bags or cloths bags, and are stored  in cool places. The moisture contents of the seeds must be examined before the  packing.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  <strong>Extraction of Oil and  Quality Control</strong><br />
                  All  parts of <em>Tagetes patula</em> contain essential oil, which can readily be  extracted by steam distillation. The oil has a pronounced odour and acts as a  repellent to flies. It has been reported that I-limonene, ocimene, I-linalyl  acetate and I-linalool have been extracted from <em>Tagetes erecta.</em> While  evaluating the different species for essential oil contents, <em>T. signata</em> contained higher essential oil (4.25 of dry matter) of very good quality which  can be used in perfume industry.<br />
                  <strong>Marketing, Distribution  and Transportation</strong> <br />
                  Crop  has a good demand in decoration, garlands, loose flower and religious function  etc. So can be marketed to major/ big cities where these can be supplied to  hotels, institutions, etc. For garlands distribution distributed to the market  flower should be packed in bamboo basket which should be covered under moist  muslin cloth.<br />
                  <strong>Pinching</strong><br />
                  Apical  portion of shoot if removed early, a large number of axillary shoots arise  resulting in well shaped bushy plants bearing more number of uniform flowers.  The removal of shoot apices 40 days after transplanting enhances the flower  yield.<br />
                  <strong>Important tips and best  practices for crop cultivation</strong> </p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Always       use disease free planting material </li>
                  <li>Timely       weed management should be done. </li>
