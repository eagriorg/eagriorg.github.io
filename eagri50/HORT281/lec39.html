				<p align="center"><strong>PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY OF CROSSANDRA</strong><br />
				<strong>Scientific name:</strong> <em>Crossandra  spp</em><strong>.<br />
Family: </strong>Acanthaceae<br />
            <p>Crossandra is an important  commercial flower, mainly grown in India, tropical Africa and Madagascar. The  flowers are commonly used for hair adornment. Though not fragrant, flowers are  very popular because of its attractive bright colour, light weight and good  keeping quality. These are used for making garland, either alone or in  combination with jasmine flowers. Using Crossandra flowers in combination with  jasmine is becoming increasingly popular in India, particularly in southern  parts, because the jasmine flowers provide colour contrast and the desired  fragrance.<img width="306" height="210" src="lec39_clip_image002.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /><br />
<strong>Species and Cultivars</strong><br />
            Crossandra belongs to the family  Acanthaceae. There are 20-25 species but only few like <em>Crossandra  infundibuliformis,</em> <em>Crossandra  undulaefolia, C. guineensis, C.mucronata and C.subacaulis</em> are cultivated.  The species grown for commercial flower production is <em>Crossandra undulaefolia</em>. These are small, evergreen shrubs freely  producing flowers in dense sessile spikes. Orange, Delhi, Lutea Yellow and  Sebaculis Red are four different cultivars of the species.
				
				<ul>
				  <li>Orange  Crossandra is tetraploid (2n=40), sets seeds profusely, breeds true and  produces bright orange coloured flowers.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p align="center"><img width="223" height="169" src="lec39_clip_image004.jpg" align="middle" hspace="12" /></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The  cultivar Delhi is triploid (2n=30) and produces more attractive flowers of  bright deep orange colour.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p align="center"><img width="219" height="175" src="lec39_clip_image006.jpg" align="middle" hspace="12" /></p>
				<p>Lutea  Yellow is tetraploid (2n=40) and the flowers are orange yellow rolour.</p>
				<p align="center"><img width="222" height="175" src="lec39_clip_image008.jpg" align="middle" hspace="12" /></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Sebaculis  Red is tetraploid (2n=40) and hardy cultivar, which possesses high degree of  tolerance to nematodes.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p align="center"><img width="230" height="194" src="lec39_clip_image010.jpg" align="middle" hspace="12" /></p>
				<p><strong>Breeding </strong><br />
			    The breeding work done at the Tamil  Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) resulted in a hybrid between two local  types collected from Palni and Marudha malai hills. This hybrid produces larger  flowers and has high degree of field tolerance to nematode -fungus complex. The  flowers are very attractive with yellowish orange petals. Another hybrid,  evolved by crossing the orange-flowered cultivar and the sebaculis Red,  produces very attractive dark pink flowers.</p>
				<p><strong>Climate and Soil</strong><br />
				  Crossandra is a tropical plant and  cannot tolerate low temperature and frost. It grows well in places where the  temperature is around 30°C and requires a well-drained soil rich in organic  matter. Alkaline or saline soils are not suitable because plants develop  chlorosis. <br />
                  <strong>Propagation </strong><br />
				  The plants can be raised through the  seeds as well as by cuttings or seedlings. The required seed rate is 5 kg/ha  for optimum plant population. For Delhi Crossandra, rooted cuttings have to be  used for planting. Cutting should be transplanted when sufficient roots are  developed. In case of seedlings,  they  are raised in the month of April – May and Aug – Sep. The seedlings are raised  in poly bags. <br />
                  <strong>Planting</strong><br />
				  Seedlings or rooted cuttings, treated  with fungicide and nematicide like Emisan (1 g/lit of water), should be planted  on the side of ridges at a spacing of 30 cm between plants and 60 cm between  the ridges. Planting should be done in moist soil. Providing partial shade  is beneficial to maintain the health of  plants and obtain higher yield of flowers.<br />
				  In case of seedlings they are transplanted at  4- 6 leaves stage i.e 8-10 days old seedlings<br />
                  <strong>Manuring and fertilization</strong><br />
				  High fertility in the soil is  essential for good yield. In addition to the basal application of farmyard  manure, periodical top dressing with fertilizers and organic manure is  essential. The first application of fertilizers should be done in 50-60 days  after planting. The doses of chemical fertilizers recommended are urea @ 50  kg/ha, superphosphate @ 100 kg/ha, and muriate of potash @ 60 kg/ha. Fertilizer  should be applied twice at an interval of 6 months, except in the rainy season.  Application of either farmyard manure or compost has to be done at the rate of  25 tonnes per hectare. The application of fertilizers is to be necessarily  followed by irrigation. Weeding, application of   fertilizer and earthing up are combined together and done simultaneously  for easy operation.<br />
                  <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
				  Adequate  irrigation helps in rapid growth of the plant and also to obtain regular flower  yield. At the time of planting, the soil should have optimum moisture for  initial growth. During dry period irrigation   should be given at shorter intervals and also during the flowering  stages which results in more flower and also encourage better plant  development.<br />
                  <strong>After  cultivation</strong><br />
				  Spray Diuron (pre-emergence)@ 2.5 kg  a.i/ha for controlling the weeds.<strong></strong><br />
                  <strong>Flowering</strong><br />
                  <img width="258" height="199" src="lec39_clip_image002_0000.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /><img width="265" height="199" src="lec39_clip_image004_0000.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /><strong> </strong></p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p>            Crossandra comes to flowering  2-3 months after planting and continues to  bear flowers throughout the year with a drop in production during the rainy  season. The flowers open in sequence from the base of the spike. Two flowers  which are diagonally opposite in the spike, open at the same time. It takes  about two days for complete opening of the flower. <br />
                    <strong>Plant protection</strong><br />
                    <strong>Pests</strong><br />
                    <strong>Nematode</strong><br />
				  Avoid planting Crossandra in  nematode infested fields. To control nematodes, apply Phorate or Carbofuran 3 G  at 1 kg a.i./ha a week after planting and any one of the above chemicals at 3  and 9&nbsp;g respectively per square metre length after six months of the first  application.<br />
  <strong>Aphids</strong><br />
				  To control aphids, spray  Dimethoate 30 EC @ 2 ml/lit.<br />
  <strong>Diseases</strong><br />
  <strong>Wilt</strong> <br />
				  Drench the soil around the  plants with Methoxyethyl mercury chloride (Emisan) at 2 g/lit or Carbendazim  0.5 ml/lit.<br />
  <strong>Crop duration</strong><br />
				  It  extends up to 3 years including ratoon crop in the third year.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p align="center"><img width="183" height="137" src="lec39_clip_image006_0000.jpg" align="middle" hspace="12" /><strong> </strong></p>
				<p><strong>Picking/Harvesting</strong><br />
				  Picking of flowers has to be done on  alternate days. Depending on the length of spike, it takes nearly 15-25 days to  complete flowering on a spike. After the flowering is over, the spent spikes  are removed. The fully opened flowers remain fresh on the plant for about three  days but when picked they fade away in 36-48 hours.<br />
  <strong>Yield</strong><br />
				  An average yield of 2000 kg of  flowers per ha/year can be obtained. In Delhi Crossandra, 2800 kg of flowers  per ha per year can be obtained.<br />
  <strong> Marketing</strong><br />
				  For marketing loose flowers the flowers are  packed in wet cloth or gunny bags and sometimes in basket.<br />
