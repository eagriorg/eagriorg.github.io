				<p align="center"><strong>Importance of  Olericulture</strong><br />
				 <p> India is the second largest producer of  vegetables in the world (surpassed only by China), accounting for about 10 per  cent of the world's production. In 2002, India produced 78.2 million tons from  5.73 million ha of land. Indian farmers grow an amazing number that is 175  different vegetables  but potato, tomato, onion, cabbage and  cauliflower account for 60 per cent of total production. <br />
				  It is projected that the domestic  vegetable requirements will rise from current levels of 83-91 million tonnes to  151-193 million tonnes by 2030. Indian farmers today cannot meet the high  domestic demand for vegetables, as India imports approximately $678 million of  vegetables annually. <br />
				  To increase domestic vegetable  production, improvements are first needed in the vegetable seed industry. There  are now more than 50 seed companies developing new vegetable varieties, with  increased emphasis on high-yielding hybrids. The Indian Council of Agricultural  Research has three major institutes for conducting research on vegetables:  Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR) in Bangalore, Indian  Institute for Vegetable Research (IIVR) at Varanasi, and Indian Agriculture  Research Institute (IARI) in New Delhi. Almost all agricultural universities and  the State Department of Agriculture are involved in vegetable research and  development. Among the 25,000 plant scientists in  India, at least 1,000 are conducting research  on vegetables. To increase year-round vegetable consumption, the seasonality of  production must be reduced. Processing can make vegetables more accessible  year-round, but less than 7 per cent of India's vegetable production is  processed. Another factor that limits consumption is post-harvest damage.  Currently 20-25 per cent of vegetables produced are lost due to poor  post-harvest handling, and in the case of tomato and cabbage, Post- harvest  losses are as high as 60 per cent. To remedy these losses, special cold storage  vegetable markets and supermarkets are emerging in metropolitan areas.  Specialized vegetable marketing centers are organized in strategic locations  and vegetables farmers receive assistance to transport and systematically  market their produce.<br />
  <strong>Vegetable exports under  WTO regime </strong><br />
  <strong>         </strong>India  is a major exporter of vegetables, exporting approximately $246 million of <br />
				  vegetables  annually. In the past, Indian vegetable exports were restricted to potatoes and  fresh onions. But now the Government of India observes great  opportunities for expanding exports of  several more vegetables, including lettuce, fresh peppers, tomatoes, squash and  gherkins. For example, the export of fresh tomatoes alone increased eight fold. </p>
				<strong><br clear="all" />
                </strong>
                <p><strong>Export potential </strong><br />
                  The world trade organization (WTO) and  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has opened new opportunities for  exporting fresh and processed vegetables. During 2001-02, Rs. 582.31 crore have  been realised with the export of total fresh vegetables. In India, Agricultural  and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) is the nodal  organisation to access the market, guide and promote export of agricultural  commodities. APEDA has identified traditional vegetables including okra, bitter  gourd, chilli, onion, potato and non-traditional vegetables like asparagus,  celery, sweet pepper, sweet corn, baby corn, green peas, french bean, cucumber,  gherkins and cherry tomato having good export potential. Cultivation of new  vegetable like gherkin, baby corn, sweet corn, broccoli, Brussels sprouts,  Chinese cabbage, asparagus, celery and parsley is one the rise trends and  provide better returns.   The vegetables  being exported include okra, tomato, baby corn, cucumber, gherkins, chillies,  french bean, capsicum, bitter gourd, bottle gourd, onion and potato. Usually,  nontraditional vegetables are exported to European countries and Australia, in  addition to Gulf and South East Asian Countries. Whole pod edible garden pea is  also in demand in European countries. However onion and traditional vegetables  are being exported to Malaysia, Singapore, Gulf countries, Sri Lanka,  Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal. <br />
  <strong>Export of processed  vegetables </strong><br />
                  The Government of India while realising  the global potential of processed fruits and vegetables, even in dried and  dehydrated form. has classified the horticulture development as a thrust area.  A national policy and programme has been formulated in this regard, there are a  number of schemes facilitated at Centre/State Govt. levels for development of  this industry. The Ministry of food Processing Industries has been offering  appreciable economic incentives to promote food parks in the country, while APEDA/Ministry  of Commerce encourages and supports the establishing of Agri Export Zones  (AEZs). The installed capacity of food and vegetable processing industry in the  country has increased from 1,108 million tonnes in 1993 to 2.328 million tonnes  as on 1st April. 2004. The utilisation of fruits and vegetables for processing  in the organised and unorganised sector is estimated to be around 2 per cent of  the total production, over the last few years, there has been a positive growth  in ready-to-serve beverages, dehydrated and frozen vegetables, tomato products,  pickles, spices paste and curried vegetables. There are about 63 vegetables  traded in the world market in dehydrated, canned and processed form. Dried and  preserved vegetables are in demand in Egypt, Sri Lanka,UAE, USA and Turkey. The  total quantity of dried and preserved vegetables exported during 2003-2004 is  estimated to be 211.16 lakh tonnes valued at Rs, 520.49 crore. The export of  dehydrated vegetables from India is dominated by just five main products, which  are onion flakes and powder, tamarind powder, dehydrated vegetables, garlic  powder/flakes.  The main product of  export is dehydrated onion flakes/powder, which has been of the order of about  7224 MT valued at Rs.32.95 crores approximately in the year 2000-01.<br />
                  Human body requires a wide range of  nutrients like carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins and minerals for normal  growth and sustenance of physiological activities.  Protein, carbohydrates and fat, generally  referred as proximate principles are required in large quantities and are  oxidized in the body to yield energy.   Protein is the major growth promoting or body building nutrient.  Vitamins and minerals are required in small quantities for physiological  processes and metabolic activities.   Vegetables are rich and comparatively cheap sources of vitamins like β-carotene,  folic acid, vitamin-B, vitamin-C, vitamin-E, minerals like iron, calcium,  magnesium, phosphorus and dietary fibres.   It also supplies fair amount of carbohydrates, protein (4%) and energy  (10%).<br />
                  Vitamin-A is essential for clear  vision in dim light and its deficiency leads to night blindness and dry-eye or  Xerophthalmia.  Vitamin-A as β-carotene  or pro-vitamin-A, which gets converted to vitamin-A in liver and  intestine.  Former is found only in foods  of animal origin.  The β-carotene is  found in green leaf vegetables and yellow fruits / tubers like carrot, pumpkin,  papaya and sweet potato.  This  fat-soluble vitamin is not soluble in water and is not easily lost while  cutting, washing and cooking.<br />
                  Prolonged deficiency of Thiamine  (vitamin-B1) leads to beri beri disease Vitamin B 2 complex consisting of  riboflavin and nicotinic acid (niacin), vitamin-B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin-B12  and folic acid (folacine) are all essential for metabolic activities and their  deficiency lead to pellagra, anemia and other disorders.  Leguminous vegetables, onion bulbs, green  onion, sweet potato and cabbage contain a fair amount of vitamin-B group.  Folic acid is abundant in spinach, other green  leaf vegetables and beans.<br />
                  Man requires about 50 mg of  vitamin-C (Ascorbic acid) daily and is mainly met from fruits and  vegetables.  Its deficiency causes  “scurvy” characterized by weakness, bleeding gums and defective bone  growth.  Vitamin-C is a strong reducing  agent and is lost easily on exposure to air and on cooking.  Vegetables like tomato, sweet pepper, chilli,  immature bean seed and bean sprouts are good sources of vitamin-C.<br />
                  Vitamin-E (α-tocopherol) prevents  oxidation of β-carotene and vitamin-A in intestine. Green leaf vegetables are  fairly good sources of this vitamin.   Leaf vegetables like palak, fenugreek, drumstick etc. supply a fair  amount of minerals like calcium, iron, phosphorus etc.  Tender fruits of okra contain iodine,  essential for prevention of goiter disease.<br />
                  Root and tuber vegetables like  potato, sweet potato, cassava, yams and elephant foot yam contain high amount  of carbohydrates.  Leguminous vegetables  like peas, beans, cowpea and hyacinth bean are good sources of proteins (14%).<br />
                  Vegetables are rich sources of  dietary fibre consisting of cellulose, non-starch polysaccharides and  lignin.  Role of dietary fibre in  protection against colon cancer, lowering of blood pressure and diabetes is  realized now.  It is recommended to include-40.0  g of dietary fibre in our daily diet.   Most of leaf vegetables are rich sources of dietary fibre.<br />
                  Recommended daily allowance (RDA) by  the Indian Council of Medical Research in   for an adult man is 300 g of vegetables.   It includes 100 g roots and tubers, 125g of leaf vegetables and 75 g  other vegetables.  The RDA for a woman is  75 g roots and tubers, 125 g. leaf vegetables and 75 g other vegetables  totaling to 275 g/day.  However, it  varies with age of people and nature of work.<br />
  <strong>Vegetables as protective food</strong><br />
                  Vegetables are protective foods as  their consumption prevents many diseases.   Almost all vegetables are finding important roles in traditional systems  of medicine.  Several chemicals having  therapeutic value were identified from vegetables.  Antioxidants and flavanoids are the most  important among them.<br />
                  Role of vegetables as a source of  antioxidants in prevention of new generation diseases and delaying ageing is  well recognized.  Antioxidants like  β-carotene, ascorbic acid (vitamin-C), α-tocopherol (vitamin-E), amino acids  and flavanoids present in various vegetables act as scavengers of free  radicals, which induce cancer development, brain disorders and  arteriosclerosis.  Free radicals are  molecules or atoms with unpaired electrons and are unstable and highly  reactive.  These free radicals initiate  chain reactions of destructive processes by removing electrons from stable  compounds forming many unstable compounds, free radicals and reactive oxygen  species (ROS).  Inflammation, strenuous  exercise, exposure to certain chemicals, radiation, UV light, alcohol,  cigarette smoke, air pollutants and excess of free fat diets also produce free  radicals.  Ageing results in a decreased  production of enzymes, which counter adverse effects of free radicals and ROS.<br />
                  Antioxidants act as scavengers of  free radicals and ROS, and prevent them from causing further damage.  Actions of free radicals are prevented or  inactivated by chain reaction antioxidants.   Antioxidants have definite roles in prevention of certain cancer, age  related eye diseases, coronary artery diseases and HIV.  Certain minerals like selenium and flavanoids  like quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin and luteolin have also been isolated from  vegetables.<br />
                  Onion and garlic contain several  sulphur compounds like allicin and diallyl disulphide which are effective for  control of blood cholesterol and preventing heart diseases.  It also has antibacterial properties.  The diphenylamine in onion is effective  against diabetes.<br />
                  Bitter gourd contains a hypoglycemic  ingredient ‘cheratin’ having effect against diabetes. Leguminous vegetables and  brinjal also reduce blood cholesterol level indicating their role in preventing  heart diseases.  The 3-n-butyl pthalide  isolated from celery is effective against hypertension.  Certain species of yams contain diosgenin,  used in manufacture of cortisone and contraceptive drugs.<br />
                  Cole crops like Brussels sprouts,  sprouting broccoli, knol khol and cabbage have anti-carcinogenic properties  mainly due to hydrolysed glucosinolate derived products such as isothiocynates  and indoles.  Presence of Indol-3 carbinol,  offers protection against bowel cancer.   Although, enzymatic hydrolytic products from glucosinolates are  goitrogenic, some of the breakdown products induce enzymes responsible for  detoxification of reactive carcinogens and eliminates carcinogens from  mammalian tissue.  The National Research  Council Committee on Diet, Nutrition and Cancer, India and the American Cancer  Society suggested inclusion of vegetables belonging to <em>Brassica </em>genus to reduce incidence of human cancer.  In ancestral times, it was used against gout,  diarrhea, stomach and celiac troubles.   Cabbage juice is used as a remedy against poisonous mushrooms.<br />
  <strong>Toxic and anti-nutrient compounds</strong><br />
                  Plants produce toxins as a defense  mechanism to protect from man and animals.   During course of evolution and continuous cultivation, these undesirable  qualities might have been eliminated by selection.  Still a few harmful chemicals like trypsin  inhibitors, phytates, oxalates and nitrates exist in cultivated vegetables.<br />
                  Trypsin inhibitors are widely  distributed in legumes, especially in raw soybeans.  They inhibit activity of trypsin in the gut  and interfere with digestibility of dietary proteins and reduce their  utilization by affecting hydrolysis of proteins to amino acids.<br />
                  Phytic acid (inositol hexaphosphoric  acid) present in mature seeds of peas and beans binds iron, zinc, calcium and  magnesium and reduces bio-availability of iron.   On germination of grains, phytate content reduces due to enzymatic break  down which improves iron availability.<br />
                  Green leaf vegetables and legumes  are rich source of oxalates and oxalic acid.   Maximum oxalate concentration is noticed in amaranth (772 mg / 100  g).  Oxalic acid converts calcium from  the food consumed to insoluble calcium oxalates making it unavailable for  absorption.  Calcium oxalate crystals  present in leaves and tubers of <em>Amorphophallus </em>and <em>Colocasia </em>cause itching of  skin, tongue and throat.  Dietary  oxalates contribute to increased excretion of oxalate in urine leading to  urinary stones.<br />
                  Vegetables are the single largest  source of nitrate in human diet.  Leaf  vegetables have high concentration of nitrate.   Nitrate accumulation results in serious deleterious effects.  Within gastrointestinal tract, nitrate is  reduced to nitrite, which is absorbed into blood stream where it binds with  hemoglobin, oxidizing ferrous ion to ferric ion to form methaemoglobin.  Methaemoglobin is incapable of oxygen  transport and results in anoxia specifically referred to as “methaemoglobinaemia”.  When nitrite ions combine with secondary or  tertiary amines, N-nitroso compounds are formed, a few of which are potent  carcinogens.  On cooking, nitrate content  gets reduced drastically.<br />
                  Tapioca leaves contain glucosides,  which liberate hydrocyanic acid by action of enzymes in stomach.  <em>Dioscorea </em>species contain a toxic alkaloid, dioscorin that can be made harmless by  boiling.  Potato tubers when exposed to  sunlight become green and produce an alkaloid called solanin, which is bitter  in taste.  A few brinjal varieties were  also found bitter due to high solanin content.<br />
                  All the brassicas contain  glucosinolates (thioglucosides), which are sulphur containing compounds.  Break down of glucosinolates with help of  their associate enzymes produce the culinary flavour to cabbage, cauliflower  and broccoli.  The thioglucosides  (sinigrin) are non-goitrogenic.  But on  enzymatic hydrolysis in the presence of an enzyme myrosinase, it produces allyl  thiocynate-a goitrogen.  At high intake  levels, it causes enlargement of thyroid glands.  Though cabbage contains goitrogen, its  goitrogenic properties would be lost during cooking. <br />
