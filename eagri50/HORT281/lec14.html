                    <em>Brassica oleracea</em> var. <em>gongylodes<strong></strong></em><br />
                               <p align="center"> Knol-khol (<em>Brassica oleracea</em> var. <em>gongylodes</em>) is known  by many names in India. It is popular in Kashmir, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Assam,  Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and some parts of south India, but it is not cultivated  commercially. It is characterized by the formation of knob (tuber) which arises  from a thickening of the stem tissue above the cotyledons. The fleshy  turnip-like enlargement of the stem develops entirely above the ground. This  knob is harvested for human consumption as raw or cooked vegetable, though in  some parts, young leaves are also used.<img src="lec14_clip_image005.gif" width="593" height="328" border="0" align="middle" usemap="#MicrosoftOfficeMap0" /></p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Climate and soil </strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Knol-khol thrives best in a relatively cool, moist  climate. In temperate regions, the early varieties are sensitive to early  bolting but under subtropical conditions, this problem is not much since the  vernalization effect of low night temperature is counteracted by high  temperatures during the day with the result that mean temperature hardly goes  below 10°C. The high temperature after planting delays the bolting of plants  that have been vernalized on the seed bed. It grows well with a monthly average  temperature of 15°–20°C, maximum and minimum average being 24°C and 4.5°C. In  late varieties, low temperature does not have stimulating effect on bolting in  early stages. It is vernalized in the later stages only as other biennial cole  crops when the plant has made some growth. It can withstand extreme cold and frost  better than other cool season crops.<br />
				  Varieties that are susceptible to bolting lack a juvenile  phase and become generative without producing knobs if exposed after  germination to low temperature. When the low temperature occurs at the knob  formation stage, the round and flat round varieties produce long oval-shaped  knobs. The low temperature or frost conditions sometimes develop the  anthocyanin pigments on knobs or plant parts. These pigments are intensified,  if there is lack of N and P in soil, deteriorating the quality of knobs,  especially of green types.<br />
				  Knol-khol  can be grown on all types of soils. A soil rich in manures and fertilizers  produces excellent knobs. Sandy loam is ideal for an early crop and clay or  silt loam for higher yield and late crop. It does not grow well in highly  acidic soil. The optimum pH is 5.5–6.8.<br />
                  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
				  Some of the promising  varieties available in India are Sutton's Earliest Purple (Sutton), Golith  White (Sadashiv), Early White Vienna, King of the Market and Early Purple  Vienna (Verma, Pocha). Although research stations and some private seed  companies are engaged in testing and maintenance of varieties, no serious  attempt has been made for the improvement of the crop as the available  introductions are well-suited to our conditions. The recommended varieties are:<br />
                  <strong>King of North</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>It has a plant height of 20–30cm foliage is dark green, knob  flattish-round, leaf sheath large and well-spread over the knob. It matures  60–65 days after transplanting.<br />
				  In Europe, Wiesmoor Forcing  White and Gaugels Forcing White are resistant to bolting and mature 30–45 days  after planting. These are early varieties characterized by the horizontal  position of the lower leaves. The late varieties mature 70–100 days after  planting. The earliest variety in this group is Purple Speck while Goliath, is  late.<br />
                  <strong>Large Green</strong> <br />
				  It has green, round, large-sized knobs with small tops.  The knobs are tender, delicately flavoured with white flesh. It is ready for  harvesting in 76 days with an average yield potential of 225–250q/ha. It has  been recommended for mid and high hills of the western Himalayas.<br />
                  <strong>Purple Vienna</strong> <br />
				  This is about one week late than White Vienna. Knobs are  purplish-blue with greenish-white flesh. It has purple leaves. It requires  55–65 days for knob formation with slightly better yield potential than White  Vienna.<br />
                  <strong>White Vienna</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>This is an early variety with globular, light green, smooth,  tender, medium-sized knobs having creamy-white tender flesh with delicate  flavour. Its plants are dwarf, leaves and stems are medium green. It has a  yield potential of 150–200q/ha. It matures 55–65 days after transplanting.  Early White Vienna has dwarf plants, short tops and globular round knobs. It  takes 50–60 days for knob formation.<br />
                  <strong>Cultivation<br />
                  </strong>            Knol-khol  is usually propagated by seed, the seed rate being 1–1.5kg/ha. Seed should be  given a hot water treatment (50°C) for half an hour against black rot and Apron  35 @ 2g/kg seed against downy mildew before sowing in disease-prone areas. The  seedlings are raised in the nursery beds. About 4–6 weeks old seedlings are  ready for transplanting.<br />
				  Generally, 60cm wide and 2.5m long nursery beds are  prepared. For 1m2 nursery 100g of fertilizer mixture containing 15g each N, P  and K and 2.5–4kg farmyard manure mixed well in soil and raised nursery bed  must be prepared with 30cm channel along with the nursery. On light and drought  sensitive soils, sunken nursery beds are preferred. Acidic soils should be  limed. For minimizing the seedling damage, the nursery beds should be treated  with formalin (40% formaldehyde diluted in 5–6 parts of water). Soil is  saturated with this solution, requiring 5 litres/m2. Fumes are then confined by  covering nursery beds with burlap or canvas or polythene for 2 days and then  the soil is aerated well for at least 4 days before sowing. This treatment can  be replaced by the use of Captan (0.3%) for soil drenching. Seeds are sown in  rows at a distance of 5–6cm for ease in manual hoeing, weeding and thinning. In  too close spacing, the seedlings are liable to be attacked by damping off  disease and become lanky. Proper spacing results in stocky and vigorous  seedlings. A depth of 1.5–2cm is optimum since deeper sowing delays the  germination. The nursery bed is covered with grass to conserve moisture for  uniform germination. It is watered as and when required with watering can. The  mulch is removed just before the seed germination to control damping off,  drenching with Dithane M-45 (0.2%) is recommended. Nitrogenous fertilizer  (urea) may be added in the spray when the seedlings growth is poor. However,  excessive N results in tender and lanky plants that show poor establishment  after transplanting. Seedlings are hardened in the nursery by restricting the  water supply for about a week before transplanting in the field to enable them  to withstand the shock of transplanting.<br />
                  <strong>Planting</strong><br />
				  In the plains of north India,  planting may be done in September, while in the milder winter regions, October  is best time for planting. In the hills of northern India, seeds are sown from  March–April to August. About 5–6 week old seedlings are transplanted for summer  and autumn crops. The growing of nursery in March– April needs protection from  cold and frost for which low cost polyhouses may be used.<br />
				  Preparation of land is done by 2–3 ploughings, firstly  with soil turning plough and after ploughings with ordinary plough/tiller or  disc harrow to get fine tilth. The beds and channels are prepared to facilitate  irrigation. Transplanting of seedlings is done in the evening and/or on cloudy days.  The soil around the plant should be well pressed to establish contact with the  roots. This process should be followed by light irrigation. The dead plants  should be replaced and gaps be filled 5–6 days after transplanting. The  transplanting is done at a closer spacing of 25cm × 25cm, 25cm × 30cm, 25cm ×  40cm or 30cm × 45cm depending on climatic conditions and fertility of the soil.  The yield is more in close spacing but the size of knobs is reduced. The early  varieties may be planted at closer spacing while the late ones require wider  spacing.<br />
                  <strong>Manuring and fertilization </strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Knol-khol responds well to manuring, as it is a  heavy feeder. A yield of 20 tonnes/ha removes about 100kg N, 85kg P and 170kg  K. Excess of N may cause abundant leafy growth and a delayed crop. Split  application of N is more beneficial. Half of N along with full quantity of P  and K are applied at the time of transplanting. The remaining half N is applied  in 2 equal split doses, 3 weeks after transplanting and the other at the knob  development stage. The farmyard manure is added to soil 4–6 weeks before  transplanting. Optimum N and K doses are necessary to get good flavoured knobs.<br />
				  The deficiency of B, Mo and N may induce physiological  disorders such as browning, whiptail and buttoning. Foliar application of urea  (1–2%) to correct the N deficiency is useful and economical. Multiplex  (0.2–0.3%) can be added in the spray to correct the general micronutrient  deficiencies. However, to correct deficiency alone, 10–15kg/ha of borax as soil  application or 2 sprays of 0.3% borax on the crop are beneficial. In highly  acidic soils, Mo deficiency can be overcome by liming or soil application of  ammonium molybdate @ 200–300g/ha at a concentration of 0.01–0.1%.<br />
                  <strong>Aftercare</strong><br />
				  Steady growth is of utmost  importance. Any check in the growth causes knobs to be fibrous and woody. On  the other hand, too rapid growth after slow initial growth may result in  cracking knobs though a lot of varietal variation exists. The knobs may become  elongated in close spacing due to lack of light as in knobs growing in the  shade. The production of elongated knobs may also be induced by high  temperature and excess of N. Cracking of knobs also occurs if the long-dry  spell is followed by moist conditions or irrigation, because of increased root  pressure.<br />
				  The intercultural operations are performed mainly to  check the weed growth to make the soil loose and to maintain proper moisture  condition. Since its root system is shallow, hoeing is done to keep the crop  weed-free. Presence of weeds in the early stages reduces the yield due to poor  growth of the plants. Timely hoeings help check the weed population. As soon as  the weeds start appearing, shallow hoeing should be done. Once the weeds are  well-established, their removal disturbs the root system of plants resulting in  weak growth. No sooner the soil is covered with foliage, hoeing is stopped.  Hoeing during the knob development stage is discouraged and weeds if any  removed by hand.<br />
				  Treflan (Trifluralin @ 0.5 litre/ha) and Semeron  (Desmetrayne @ 1kg/ha) applied before transplanting control both monocot and  dicot weeds. Use of black polythene mulch for controlling weeds can also be  made. Recently the effectiveness of Stomp (Pendimethalin @ 1–2kg/ha) in  controlling weeds has been recommended. Practice of a weedicide application  supplemented with 1 or 2 hand hoeings is useful and economical.<br />
                  <strong>Irrigation<br />
                  </strong>            Knol-khol  requires a continuous supply of moisture for uniform growth and development of  knobs. First irrigation is done immediately after transplanting and thereafter  irrigation is done when needed, depending on soil and weather conditions.  Irrigations at 15 days interval are adequate. Heavy irrigation should be  avoided. Irrigation should be applied when the moisture content of the soil has  dropped below 50% of field capacity. At the time of maturity of knobs,  irrigation is detrimental.<br />
                  <strong>Harvesting and Post harvest management</strong> <br />
				  The knobs are harvested by cutting the stem just below it  by a sharp knife or sickle before they are fully grown. After that they become  tough and woody. The demand is fairly high for knobs of smaller size of about  5–8cm diameter. In preparing the produce for the market, the root portion is  removed and the plants are tied in bunches along with the tender leaves. It is  also marketed after removing both leaves and roots.<br />
				  The knobs of early varieties may have an average weight  of 200–250g while those of late ones weigh up to 1kg. Generally, the yield may  vary from 12–30t/ha.<br />
