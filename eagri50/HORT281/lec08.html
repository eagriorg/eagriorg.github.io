                    <strong>Smooth Gourd (<em>Luffa cylindrica </em>Roem.) </strong><strong>(2n = 26) </strong>(Hindi: Kali tori)<br />
			    <p>Both ridge or ribbed gourd and  smooth or sponge gourd belong to genus <em>Luffa.  </em>Genus name was derived from the product  “Loofah” used as bathing sponges, scrubber pads, doormats, pillows, mattresses,  cleaning utensils, etc.  Both species  contain a gelatinous compound called luffein.<br />
  <strong>            </strong>Both crops are cultivated on a  commercial scale and grown in homesteads for its immature fruits which are used  as cooked vegetable.  Fibre of mature dry  fruits is used as a bath sponge.  As  tender fruits are easily digestible and appetizing, it is prescribed for those  who are suffering from malaria and other seasonal fevers.<br />

				<p><strong>Climate and soil</strong><br />
				  Like bitter gourd, ridge gourd and  smooth gourd are typical warm season crops and come up well during summer and  rainy seasons.  Optimum temperature  required is 25-27oC. Ideal soil is fertile well drained loam rich in  humus.<br />
  <strong>Cultivation practices</strong><br />
				  Both ridge and smooth gourd are  grown during summer and rainy season by sowing seeds during January – February  and June – July, respectively.  Seeds are  sown in raised beds, furrows or pits @ 3.5-5.0 kg/ha for ridge gourd and  2.5-5.0 kg/ha for sponge gourd.  Since  seeds are with hard seed coat, it is advisable to soak seeds overnight in  water.  A row-to-row distance of 1.5-2.5  m and hill to hill distance of 60-120 cm is required for both crops under bower  or trellis system.  When it is trailed to  ground under pit system, a row-to-row spacing of 1.5-2.0 m and pit-to-pit  distance of 1.0-1.5 m are recommended for both crops.<br />
				  Manure and fertilizer requirements,  irrigation and intercultural operations are same as that of bitter gourd.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting</strong><br />
				  Crop is ready for harvest in about 60  days after sowing.  Both crops are picked  at immature tender stage.  Fruits attain  marketable maturity 5-7 days after anthesis.   Over-mature fruits will be fibrous and are unfit for consumption.  To avoid over-maturity, picking is done at  3-4 days interval.  Harvested fruits are  packed in baskets to avoid injury and can be kept for 3-4 days in a cool  atmosphere.<br />
  <strong>Yield</strong>: 7-5 – 15.0 t/ha.<br />
  <strong>Pests and Diseases of Cucurbits</strong><br />
				  Cucurbits are affected by a large  number of insect pests, nematodes and diseases.   Major pests and diseases affecting cucurbit vegetables are discussed  below:</p>
				<p><strong>Pests</strong><br />
            Fruit fly, red pumpkin beetle and  epilachna beetle cause damage to most of cucurbits.  In addition, insects like gall fly; aphids,  leaf hopper, ants, worms, underground semi loopers, leaf miners, fruit borers  and mites affect specific cucurbits.   Intensity of infestation varies from place to place.<br />
<strong>Fruit fly (<em>Bacterocera cucurbitae</em>)</strong><br />
            This is a major pest of majority of  cucurbits especially that of bitter gourd, snake gourd, pointed gourd,  muskmelon, oriental pickling melon, watermelon, tinda and pumpkin.  Adult fly has reddish brown body with  transparent and shiny wings, bearing yellow-brown streaks.  It lays eggs singly or in clusters of 4-12 in  flower or developing fruits or ripening fruits with the help of sharp  ovipositor of females.  Eggs hatch in 2-9  days and maggots feed on internal contents of fruits causing rotting.  Pupation is in ground at a depth of 1.5-15.0  cm.  Infestation is more during rainy  season.<br />
            Adopt following package for control  of fruit fly:</p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Cover developing fruits with       paper cover or polythene cover immediately after anthesis and pollination.</li>
				  <li>Collect and destroy affected       fruits by dipping in hot water or insecticide solution.  Do not leave infested fruits on gourd.</li>
				  <li>Use light trap and poison baits       during night.  Spray a bait solution       containing   200 g gur or sugar and       20 ml Malathion 50 EC in 20 1 of water as coarse droplets on lower surface       of leaves.</li>
				  <li>Spraying on under surface of       leaves of maize plants grown in rows at a distance of 8-10 m in cucurbit       field is also effective as flies rest on such tall plants.</li>
				  <li>Hang baits containing sex       attractants like pheromones or protein hydrolysate with Furadan       granules.  Hanging coconut shells       with pieces of fully ripened fruits of “Mysore poovan” banana or toddy or       molasses along with Furadan granules also attract and kill fruit flies.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Red Pumpkin Beetle (<em>Aulacophora foveicollis</em>)</strong><br />
				  Beetle attacks most of cucurbits  especially melons, bottle gourd, pumpkin, cucumber, water melon etc.  Bitter gourd is not seen attacked by  beetle.  Beetles eat the leaf lamina  causing defoliation particularly at cotyledon stage of crop.  Grubs feed on underground stem and root  portion of plants causing holes / galleries and result in drying up of plants.  As insects pupate in the soil, deep ploughing soon after the crop exposes and  kills grubs and pupae.<br />
				  Application of Furadan 3 G granules  3-4 cm deep in soil near base of just germinated seedlings will take care of  young seedlings from attack of beetle.<br />
  <strong>Epilachna beetle (<em>Epilachna seplima</em>)</strong><br />
				  Epilachna beetle is a serious pest  of bitter gourd and snake gourd.  Adult  flies feed on foliage causing holes and defoliation.  A large number of yellow coloured thorny  grubs are seen on under surface of leaves and feed on chlorophyll resulting in  skeletonisation of leaves.  Mechanical  control by way of collection and destruction of egg masses and grubs are very  effective as they are seen as a colony.   It can also be controlled by spraying Carbaryl (0.2%) or Metacystox  (0.15%).<br />
  <strong>Aphids (<em>Aphis gossypii</em>)</strong><br />
				  Aphids suck sap from leaves of  cucurbits like ash gourd, snake gourd, mush melon, water melon, cucumber etc.  causing crinkling of leaves.  It also  transmits mosaic virus.  Control aphids  by spraying Malathion (0.1%) or tobacco decoction<br />
  <strong>Leaf hopper (<em>Amrasca biguttula biguttula</em>)</strong><br />
				  During summer months, jassids cause  heavy loss to bitter gourd crop.  Green  coloured hopper and its nymphs are seen in large numbers on under surface of  leaves and suck sap causing typical hopper burn symptoms.  Initially neem oil garlic mixture at  fortnightly interval is effective for control of hopper.  Spraying of Acetaf, Imidachloprid etc.  control hoppers effectively.<br />
  <strong>Red spider mites (<em>Tetranychus sp</em>.)</strong><br />
				  Larvae, nymphs and adults of mites  lacerate leaves from under surface and suck sap resulting in production of  white patches between veins in <em>Cucurmis  melo.  </em>Infested leaves turn yellow  and fall of prematurely.  In severe  cases, intense webbing occurs giving a dusty appearance to under surface of  leaves.  Mites can be controlled by spray  of neem oil garlic mixture or Kelthane or Dicofol on under surface of the  leaves.<br />
  <strong>Leaf miner (<em>Lyriomyza trifolii</em>)</strong><br />
				  This polyphagous pest causes  characteristic white twisting lines in ash gourd, <em>Cucurmis sativus </em>and <em>Cucurmis  melo.  </em>Severe leaf mining accelerates  leaf drop and retards growth and yield of plants.  Mated females puncture leaves and lays eggs  in leaf tissues.  After hatching, larvae  start feeding in palisade mesophyll cells of leaves while moving inside.  Mines start from margins of leaves and  progress towards centre.  Yellow larvae  can be seen at the end of mines.  Larval  duration is 4-6 days.  When larva is  ready to pupate, it cuts a semicircular slit on leaf surface and fall down on  ground.  Larvae emerge from leaves during  early morning before 8.00 a.m.  For  control of miner, trap adults to yellow cards applied with adhesives. Burning  infested dried leaves will help in reduction of population.  Spraying neem oil garlic mixture early in  morning before sunrise will be an effective control.<br />
  <strong>Gall fly (<em>Lasioptera</em><em> falcate</em>)</strong><br />
				  Gall flies, having shape of  mosquitoes, lay eggs in soft stem of bitter gourd, snake gourd, coccinia  etc.  Emerging larva feed inside  stem.  Since large numbers of larvae are  seen inside stem, affected portion becomes bulged and subsequent growth of stem  is arrested.  Restrict irrigation and  nitrogen fertilizers once infestation is noticed.  Cutting and removal of galls also should be  practiced regularly.  Spray systemic  insecticides under sever infestation.<br />
  <strong>Diseases</strong><br />
  <strong>Fusarium wilt (<em>Fusarium oxysporum</em>)</strong><br />
				  Fusarium wilt is a serious disease  water melon, musk melon, bottle gourd etc.   In young seedlings, cotyledons drop and wither.  Older plants wilt suddenly and vascular  bundles at the collar region show brown discolouration.  Being a soil borne disease, chemical control  is very difficult.  Cultivation of  resistant varieties and crop rotation with resistant crops are viable methods  for overcoming the disease.  To some  extent, the disease can be checked by hot water treatment of seeds at 55oC  for 15 minutes and by drenching soil with carbendazim.<br />
  <strong>Collar rot (<em>Rhizoctonia solanii</em>) / Pythium  rot<em> (Pythium</em> <em>sp.</em>)</strong><br />
				  Characteristic symptom of the  disease is appearance of dark brown water-soaked lesions girdling the base of  stem at soil level followed by death of plants.   It is more serious under water logged conditions and during rainy  seasons.  Treating seeds with Thiram @ 3  g/kg of seed before sowing, sowing of seeds on raised beds, drenching vines with  Redomyl (0.2%) or Carbendazim (0.1%) are recommended for control of the  disease.<br />
  <strong>Powdery mildew (<em>Sphaerotheca fuliginea</em>)</strong><br />
				  This disease is more destructive in  pumpkin, squashes, bottle gourd, melon and cucumber, that too, during rain free  periods.  Symptoms appear as white to  dirty grey spots or patches on leaves which become white powdery as they  enlarge.  Powdery coating covers entire  plant parts and causes defoliation.  Fortnightly  spray of Karathane (0.5%) or Calixin (0.05%) or Carbendazim (0.1%) are  recommended for control of powdery mildew.<br />
  <strong>Downy mildew (<em>Pseudoperonospora cubensis)</em></strong><br />
				  Disease is prevalent in areas of  high humidity, especially during rainy season, on crops like bitter gourd,  snake gourd, melon, bottle gourd and ridge gourd.  Symptoms appear as water soaked lesions on  under surface of leaf lamina and angular spots on upper surface corresponding  to the water-soaked lesions on under surface.   Disease spreads very fast.   Plucking and destruction of affected leaves and spraying Dithane M-45 (0.2%)  on under surface of leaves give effective control.<br />
  <strong>Anthracnose (<em>Colletotrichum lagenarium</em>)</strong><br />
				  This disease is endemic in warm and  humid conditions where rainfall and humidity are high.  Cucurbits like watermelon, bottle gourd,  cucumber and snake gourd are more susceptible to disease.  Different types of symptoms are observed on  leaves, petioles, stem and fruits.   Symptoms on young fruits appear in the form of numerous water soaked  depressed oval spots, which coalesce covering large areas.  Under humid conditions, pink masses of spores  can be seen in centre of these spots.   Pink gummy exudation may also be seen on lesions due to exudation of  spores.  Symptoms on vines occur as brownish  specks which grow into angular to circular spots.  Girdling of affected portion leads to general  blight symptoms.  Clean cultivation and  crop rotation minimize disease incidence.   Treating seeds with Carbendazim @ 25 g/kg of seed and spraying crop at  10 days intervals with Indofil M-45 (0.35%).   Benomyl or Carbendazim (0.1%) gives effective control.<br />
  <strong>Alternaria blight and fruit rot (<em>Alternaria cucumerina</em>)</strong><br />
				  This is a serious disease under warm  and humid conditions in crops like musk melon, water melon, bottle gourd, snake  gourd, cucumber and pumpkin.  Symptoms  appear as yellow spots on leaves which turn brown and finally turn black on  aging.  They usually start from margins  and produce concentric rings.  Severely  affected vines look like burnt charcoal.   Use of disease free seeds, clean cultivation and crop rotation are  effective for control of disease.  Spray  of 0.25% Indofil M-45 at 10-15 days interval is effective for disease control.<br />
  <strong>Mosaic</strong><br />
				  Viral disease are causing extensive  damage to different cucurbits like pumpkin and squashes, water melon, ridge  gourd, bitter gourd, ash gourd, melon, cucumber and coccinia.  Viral diseases are becoming serious due to  intensive and continuous cultivation of a crop with indiscriminate use of plant  protection chemicals.  Several viruses  like aphid transmitted cucumber mosaic virus, watermelon mosaic viruses like  aphid transmitted cucumber mosaic virus, watermelon mosaic virus, mechanically  transmissible tobacco virus group, non sap transmissible but white fly  transmissible yellow vein mosaic virus etc. cause malformation and damage to  plants.  Symptoms expressed by host plant  vary with virus and crop.  Mosaic  mottling, curling and twisting of leaves, shortening of internodes, stunted  growth are common symptoms and vegetative growth, flowering and productivity  are adversely affected once crop is infected.<br />
				  Complete control of the diseases is  not possible.  Adoption of practices like  collection of seeds from healthy virus free plants, seed treatment with hot air  (70oC for 2 days) or hot water (55oC for 60 minutes),  clean cultivation and removal of alternate hosts particularly weeds, avoiding  relay cropping of susceptible crops, prophylactic spray of organic pesticides,  control of vectors by spraying insecticides, use of biocontrol agents,  cultivation of tolerant / resistant varieties, avoiding cropping during mosaic  prone season and areas, either alone or in combination have to be tried for  raising a mosaic free crop.  Selection of  methods for control of viral diseases should be based on intensity of infection,  mode of transmission, etc.<br />
  <strong>Nematodes</strong><br />
				  Cucurbits are highly susceptible to  nematode infestation particularly of root knot nematode <em>Meloidogyne incognita acrita.</em>   Symptoms include premature leaf fall, wilting and decline in growth and  fruit production.  Roots of infected  plants show typical galls / knots.   Cultivation of resistant varieties, crop rotation with non-host plants,  successive deep ploughing during hot weather, soil solarization with polythene  sheets and soil fumigation with nematicides are advocated for control of root  knot nematode.<br />
  <strong>Application of fertilizers in Tamil  Nadu</strong><br />
				  Apply  10 kg of FYM, 100 g of NPK 6:12:12 g mixture as basal per pit and N @ 10 g per  pit 30 days after sowing.<br />
