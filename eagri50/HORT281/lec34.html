				<p align="center"><strong>TYPES AND  STYLES OF ORNAMENTAL GARDENS</strong><br />
                  <strong>Types of gardens - I - formal and  informal gardens</strong><br />
        <p> Man’s eternal desire is to make his  living place like that of a paradise.   The geometrical design of the earlier dwellings when man came out of  caves lead to orderliness as well as provided life security.  But it lacked the raw nature around him  inside the dwelling.<br />
<strong>FORMAL STYLE</strong><br />
         The gardens of Greece and Rome assured  an emotional security though their Formal style.  The Persian, Moorish gardens of Spain and  Moghul gardens were also of the same kind and were strictly formal, symmetrical  and geometrical resembling a carpet.<br />
         The Italian renaissance garden was  having intricate geometric designs, sheared trees, trimmed hedges and edges to  create formality.<br />
         The impact of formalism influenced the  French and British gardens also in the form of parierre, the much divided flower beds.<br />
         The Moorish garden of Spain also had  the impact of Moghul’s architecture and they were formal and geometrical though  Moorish gardens were exclusively meant to beautify patios of large mansions.<br />
<strong>The key features of formal design are</strong>
				
				<ol>
				  <li>Plan  is made on the paper and land is selected accordingly.<strong></strong></li>
				  <li>The  plan is symmetrical with square, rectangular and roads cut at right angles.<strong></strong></li>
				  <li>It  had a sort of enclosure or boundary.<strong></strong></li>
				  <li>Flower  beds also have geometric designs as in carpets.<strong></strong></li>
				  <li>The  arrangement of trees and shrubs are necessarily geometrical and kept in shape  by trimming and training.<strong></strong></li>
				  <li>Other  features like fountains, water pools, cascades, etc. are used for further attraction.<strong></strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Demerits</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Formal  gardens have no ‘secrets’ and the element of surprise is lost.<strong></strong></li>
				  <li>However,  attractive focal points at terminal and intersecting points of paths and roads  are provided to make the formal garden effective.<strong></strong></li>
				  <li>Present  day home gardens are laid out in formal design only at the frontage.<strong></strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>INFORMAL STYLE</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Hindu,  Buddhist and Japanese garden laid no emphasis on formality.</li>
				  <li>Woodlands  (vanams) and running water (streams and rivers) was the main feature around  which the garden was created in natural way.</li>
				  <li>Brindavan  of Lord Krishna was a woodland.</li>
				  <li>Every  temple was provided with irregular shaped lotus tanks.  (Latter on such tanks was given masonry  boundary either rectangular or square).</li>
				  <li>Japanese  developed an intensely national and naturalistic style of its own.  It is in Japanese garden, the asymmetric  balance has been perfected.</li>
				  <li>The  impact of industrial climate drove the Britishers to opt for natural gardens  latter</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>         The further the man is isolated from  nature (due to industrial revolution) the deep is the longing to go back to  nature.  The industrialized cities became  concrete jungles with no flavour and aroma of nature and there was emptiness in  human life.  To avert this, natural  gardens was given impetus.</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>The  nature’s projection of mountains, oceans, rivers and lakes on a larger canvas  of earth’s surface is informal with all its grandeur.  Such grandeur is mimicked in informal gardens  omitting the untamed, disastrous and violent side of nature.</li>
				  <li>Lanchlot  ‘capability’ Brown (1716-83):  She  emphasized the use of coloured flower and foliage, tree form, etc. in natural  style. </li>
				  <li>The  cottage gardens of UK had the utility with fruits, vegetable and herb plants as  well as the beauty that spans from its harmony with surrounding rural scenery.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Key feature of informal  style/natural style</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>This  style reflects naturalistic effect of total view and represents natural beauty.</li>
				  <li>It  is contrast to formal style.</li>
				  <li>Plan  is asymmetrical according to the land available for making the garden.</li>
				  <li>Smooth  curvaceous out lines are more appropriate.</li>
				  <li>Water  bodies are more irregular in shape.</li>
				  <li>Hillock  are made, water falls provided, lakes and islands, cascades, rocks,  shola and a rustic hutment are provided to  create rural effect. Appropriately grouped plants provide living quality and  they are not trimmed.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>SPECIAL TYPES OF GARDENS - I - ROOF GARDEN AND VERTICAL GARDEN</strong><br />
                    <img width="298" height="213" src="lec34_clip_image002.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /><img width="297" height="213" src="lec34_clip_image004.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /><strong>Roof Garden</strong><br />
				  Roof  gardening is one of the best ways towards fulfillment of this passion. Roof  often are decorated with potted ornamentals, both flowering and foliage. The number  of such plants may be small or large. These may be arranged systematically or  carelessly. In strict sense this is not roof gardening. A roof garden is one  which has close resemblance with the garden on the ground with various  features, like lawn, flower bed, etc., laid out tastefully according to the  principles of balance and harmony to create beauty. Main difference is in  scale; the roof garden is smaller both in expansion and height.<br />
  <strong>Types</strong><br />
				  Roof top  gardens may be private or cooperative in nature. When the garden is constructed  on a private building, usually under single ownership, it is private in nature.<br />
				  Private  roof gardens may be owned by an individual or by an institution, like hotel,  bank, office or other such establishments. Nowadays multistoried apartment  buildings are coming up. Here, the number of owners is many and all can claim a  share on the roof space. If a garden is established on the roof of such  buildings, its ownership will be considered cooperative in nature.<br />
				  The type of  planning, gardening and problems associated with cooperative roof gardens are  largely different from those of privately owned roof gardens. Under private  ownership the making and maintenance of the roof garden is shaped according to  the wish of the single owner, his taste, his financial ability and the type of  use this garden is put to. Since, under cooperative ownership individuals vary  regarding these aspects, a simpler design and management have to be worked out  to suit the fancy of each individual owner.<br />
  <strong>Suitability of the roof</strong><br />
				  A roof  garden puts considerable weight on the roof. The strength of the roof to bear  this load is the first consideration before making a start. The best thing is  to plan the engineering aspects of a new building to impart enough strength so  that the load of the garden on the roof can be carried through without the  danger of damage. Since the concept of gardening on the roof is comparatively  new in India, this aspect had not been considered while constructing the old  buildings. The planning of gardening under these two different situations will  be different to a large extent.<br />
  <strong>Drainage and water proofing</strong><br />
				  In every  roof, the drainage aspect is taken care of during the construction of the  building. Hence, drainage should not pose a problem unless it is disturbed  during garden construction. Roofs are preferably made waterproof during  construction. But this water proofing takes care mainly of the rain water. But  if gardening is done on the roof directly, the constantly moist soil is likely  to damage the roof. Hence, arrangement for additional waterproofing should be  made.Choosing  the stretch of the roof, where the construction of the building has been made  with an eye for the roof gardening, the whole roof may be utilized for  developing the garden. In other cases, a strip of land, 60-70 cm wide, along  the side of the load bearing wall may be chosen for planting.<br />
                  <strong>Planting the garden</strong><br />
The  planning of a roof garden should nearly be similar to the one on the ground,  but with limited features, like lawn, flower bed, edge, rockery, lily pool,  fountain, arch, bower, lath house and the like. Other features, like statue,  sundial, aquarium, mini-zoo, etc., may be added as variety. Garden lights and  music set up enhance the charm of the garden. Small trees, small and medium  shrubs and climbers may be grown in appropriate locations. But features like  hedge, shrubbery border and big trees have little place in a roof garden.<br />
<strong>Gardening</strong><br />
The soil  mixture for roof garden should be prepared by mixing equal parts of garden soil  and cow dung manure. Leaf mould should be a welcome alternative to cow dung for  its light weight and fluffy nature. Layout of the garden should be delineated  on the roof with powdered lime and the soil mixture should be spread 15-20 cm  thick, leaving the paths lined with bricks. Bricks should be held together  through cementing. A gap of 5mm between two bricks should be left approximately  at every 50 cm length to act as drainage hole. The soil mixture of the beds  should be held back from draining out through these holes by spreading a double  layer of close-knit nylon screen along the inner side of the brick lining.<br />
One  kilogramme (kg) of oil cake, preferably from neem (<em>Azadirachta indica</em>), mahua (<em>Madhuca  latifolia</em>) or karanj (<em>Pongamia  pinnata</em>) seeds, one kg of bone meal and 0.05 m3 of small  charcoal bits should be worked in every 10m2 of the newly prepared  beds. The pH of the soil mixture should be maintained between 6.2 and 6.8.<br />
<strong>Enclosure</strong><br />
In Indian  cities, sparrows, crow, squirrels, etc., often damage the leaves, flowers and  berries in a roof garden. Care should be taken to keep these enemies away.  Construction of an overhead framework 2.5-3.0 m high, preferably of galvanized  iron pipes overlaid with nylon net, makes a durable solution of this problem.  Stakes with their lower ends fixed in the roof soil and upper ends tied with  the overhead iron pipes may be used to support plants of the roof garden, where  necessary. To check the harmful effect of wind, which often poses serious  problem for plants in the roof garden, particularly on a tall building, a wind  break screen may be erected on the windward side. This screen may be prepared  by training suitable climbers on a wire net stretched vertically on strong  poles along the desired side.<br />
<img width="282" height="282" src="lec34_clip_image002_0000.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /><strong>Vertical Garden</strong> <br />
<strong>Preparation of vertical garden</strong><br />
<strong>Steps</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Build a 2 foot square by 11 inch high box from redwood, cedar, or pressure  treated 2 x 6s. Screw 8 foot pressure treated 2 x 2s at the center and one  corner in back, and 6 foot 2 x 2s at the other corner and 18 inches from the  back on both sides. </li>
				  <li>Pre-drill, glue and screw 1 x 2s every 6 inches, starting at the top of the  box. Extend the 1 x 2s at least an inch beyond each 2 x 2 to minimize the  danger of splitting. </li>
				  <li>Add platforms by screwing on 3 foot 1 x 2s, then screwing on 1 x 2s laid  flat to create a miniature deck. </li>
				  <li>Add one more 6 foot long 2 x 2 in the center at the front, and screw it to  the crosspieces. </li>
				  <li>Add a 1 x 4 crosspiece at the top of the two longest 2 x 2s. Attach a bird  house to the crosspiece. </li>
				  <li>Hang a bird feeder from a curved metal hanger attached to the side of the  vertical garden. </li>
				  <li>Fill the box with good soil, then plant climbing plants  and train them up the lattice. Add other plants in pots and hanging baskets.                     </li>

				<p><strong>            SPECIAL  TYPES OF GARDENS II - WATER GARDEN AND  BOG GARDEN</strong> <br />
                    <img width="284" height="213" src="lec34_clip_image004_0000.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /><img width="265" height="213" src="lec34_clip_image006.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /><strong>Water Garden</strong></p>
				<p>“Planned  planting of aquatic and semi aquatic plants in and around pool is known as  water gardening”. The reflections of the sky and the plants on the water  surface, little waves passing in parade with gems of sunbeam on their crest,  the movement of fishes in water, all give us a very pleasant and happy feeling.  A water garden may be large (or) small depending upon the size of the garden of  which it is a part. It may be natural (or) artificial / informal (or) formal.<br />
                    <strong>i) Informal pool</strong><br />
				  Those who  are fortunate enough to have a shallow pond (or) a natural depression holding  sufficient water and not drying up in the summer (or) over flowering too much  in rains, thus maintaining more (or) less a constant level, can start their  water garden conveniently in such a pool. These types of pools are informal and  so more natural. The curves and bends of such pools must be graceful and  artistic and merge with the natural landscape.<br />
				  The base of  such ponds is made impervious to water by the ‘puddling’ method. This can be  achieved by importing clay and laying it to a depth of about 30-45cm at the  bottom. Puddling consists of pummeling the wet clay with feet, or preferably  with a rod. At this stage the clay becomes impermeable to water. The pond will  be used for planting true aquatics such as lotus, water lilies, etc, where as  in shallow waters near the banks bog plants are planted.<br />
  <strong>ii) Formal pool</strong><br />
				  The formal  pool need not be situated in a low lying area; rather it should form a main  feature of the garden and should be situated in a prominent place of the  garden. <br />
  <strong>Location of pool</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The pool should be far away from the  tree, as they would cast their shade and drop the leaves into the pond; besides  the roots may damage the walls. <br />
  <strong>Construction</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Where natural water body is absent,  artificial concrete pools are constructed. The wall and bottom of such pools  should be at least 15 cm thick and fully waterproof. The depth should be 1m.  Provision should be made for an outflow pipe laid horizontally at the bottom  for completely draining out the pool. The end of the outflow pipe should run  well inside the pool and fitted with a stop cock. An inlet pipe is also  inserted into the pool. When the pool is filled up the excess water would get  out through the open end of the vertical branch of the drain pipe. An inner  concrete wall, 70cm height, is then constructed 1m away and parallel to the  wall of the pond and the space between the two walls is filled with manured  soil in sloppy manner.<br />
  <strong>Testing</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>After construction fill the pool with  water and leave it for at least 4 weeks to test for any leakage and also to  allow chemicals harmful to plant life and fish to dissolve out of the cement.<br />
  <strong>Planting</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The bottom of the pond is filled up to  a depth of 20 cm with a mixture made up of 6 parts of garden soil, 1 part of  cow dung manure, 125g of bone meal should also applied per sq. meter of the  bottom. The lilies and lotus are planted directly in the soil and then water is  filled in just to cover the crown of the plants. More water in filled in stages  as the plants make new growth. In no case should the plants be submerged. As  soon as plants starts growth water level should be increased a few cm per day.  This will help the growth of the young plants.<br />
  <strong>Care of the pool</strong> <br />
				  Aquatic  plants need very little care. However some species grow very vigorously and  need trimming to avoid overcrowding and smothering of weaker species. Sometimes  the water of the ponds becomes green, popularly known as <strong>‘blanket of weed’ </strong>covers  the surface and side walls of the pool. Add 1kg potassium permanganate (or)  120g copper sulphate to every 24,000 litres of water.<br />
  <strong>Plants for water garden</strong><br />
				  A) Surface flowering Aquatics<br />
  <em>Nelumbo lutea</em>-American  lotus<br />
  <em>Nelumbo nucifera</em>-Indian  lotus<br />
  <em>Nymphaea sp</em>-Water  lily<br />
  <em>Victoria regia</em><br />
				  B) Oxygenators<br />
  <em>Elodea canadensis</em><br />
  <em>Vallisneria spiralis</em><br />
				  C) Floating plants<br />
  <em>Eichornia crassipes</em><br />
  <em>Lemna gibba</em><strong> </strong><br />
  <strong>Marsh  (or) Bog Garden</strong><br />
  <img width="276" height="206" src="lec34_clip_image008.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /><img width="276" height="206" src="lec34_clip_image010.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /><strong> </strong><br />
				  A pond is  not an essential feature of any bog garden, but, if there is any adjacent pond,  the overflow, the over flow water can be used to keep the marsh garden moist.  The main criterion of a marsh garden is to keep it moist and in a swampy state  all throughout. For this reason, the site of the marsh garden should be low  lying where the surface drainage water will collect naturally. <br />
				  The whole  area intended to be developed into marsh garden is dug up to a depth of 60cm  and a thin larger of clay, 10-12cm deep, is placed at the bottom to form the  base of the marsh garden. Then a 12cm layer of large stones are placed over  this to ensure that the water in the marsh does not become stagnant. The rest  of the hallow is filled with a compost of garden loam suffer from drought and  be kept sufficiently moist by a trickle of water at the same time avoiding  stagnation. All parts of the marsh garden are made accessible by laying paths  of rough stones (or) bricks.<br />
  <strong>Plants  for marsh garden</strong><br />
				  Marsh plants can be categorized into  three broad groups.<br />
				  A. Plants which love 5-10cm of  standing water and are termed as “<strong>Swamp  dwellers</strong>”.<br />
				  B. Plants which live on (or) a little  above the waterline, with their roots standing in water-object soil.<br />
				  C. Plants which grow above the  saturated soil, but near enough to send their roots in search of water. eg., <em>Acorus calamus, Iris sp., Alocasia</em> <em>sp.</em><br />
  <strong>SPECIAL TYPES OF GARDENS III -  TERRARIUM</strong><br />
  <strong>Terrariums </strong><br />
  <img width="285" height="189" src="lec34_clip_image012.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /><img width="257" height="194" src="lec34_clip_image014.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" />A Terrarium is an arrangement of plants together  in one container, often with other things like rocks, stones or miniature  figures and items. Sometimes the goal of a terrarium is just to create a  pleasing arrangement of plants and other times the goal is to create a  miniature world. Terrarium planting is a specialized part of home gardening,  but an interesting one. A great many woodland plants which prosper in their  natural environments fail to grow at all in the</p>
				<p>house  due to the lack of moisture in the air. Terrariums provide this humid  atmosphere and allow you to bring the forest plants home. The theory behind the  terrarium is that in a closed container the moisture which the plants take up  through their roots and transpire through their leaves is condensed and  eventually returns to the soil again, keeping the plants watered and at the  same time keeping the air within the container at a point below saturation.<br />
                  <strong>History of terrariums</strong><br />
The  bringing of the art of the terrarium is generally credited with a man called  Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward. This came about with the publishing of his book called  &quot;On the Growth of Plants in Closely Glazed Cases&quot; which he published  in 1842. The second edition of this book was published in 1852 and is readily  available in the public domain. In the preface to his first edition he cites an  earlier reference where he wrote a letter that was published in the  &quot;Companion to the Botanical Magazine&quot; which was published in the May,  1836 issue. He also gives credit to an author named Mr. Ellis who published an  article about growing plants in closed cases in an article in &quot;Gardeners  Magazine&quot; in September of 1839. The publication of the &quot;On the Growth  of Plants in Closely Glazed Cases&quot; is considered to be the first  substantial work that outlines the theory and keeping of terrariums. </p>
				<h3>Materials Required</h3>
				<p>It doesn’t take much to set up a  terrarium: fine gravel or coarse sand, charcoal chips, synthetic fabric (nylon)  or screen to act as a soil separator, and potting mix appropriate to the plants  used. If you wish to add a decorative touch, you can cover the soil with  coloured stone, bark chips or ground cover plants.<br />
                    <strong>Containers to use</strong><br />
				  The  originality of a terrarium depends on the type of container you use, the plants  you choose and the way you arrange them. Any glass container can serve as a  terrarium, provided that it is transparent. You can recycle a large glass jar,  a fish bowl or an old aquarium. Alternatively, there are some very attractive  containers made of wood and glass or plastic available on the market.  Terrariums do not require drain holes so, unlike other planting containers,  holes are not necessary at the bottom of the container.  If you are thinking of starting your own  terrarium you will probably find that you have all the material and equipment  you need around the house. Fish tanks, especially those that are not too big  and unwieldy, make very good terrariums. All you need for them is a glass top.  If you are going to start from scratch, you can build your own container using  a flat, low sided box for the bottom, and fitting it with glass sides which can  be taped together, and a glass top. Although the theoretical airtight terrarium  would have no openings whatever, it is safer to provide the container with  several drainage holes so that you avoid the risk of over watering and rotting  the roots of your plants. If you use a large brandy glass or some other  container for which drainage holes cannot be provided, then you must be extra  careful that there is a good layer of drainage material (pebbles, gravel,  crocking, etc.) at the bottom, and that the soil is sprinkled with charcoal. <br />
  <strong>Soil  mixes/ additives</strong><br />
				  Use clean,  sterilized peat moss based soilless mix with vermiculite or perlite to enable  the soil to hold moisture and oxygen. There should be an initial layer of  gravel for drainage (one part gravel to two parts soilless mix). Add charcoal  to absorb odour (one tablespoon per cup of drainage). In a small terrarium,  omit the gravel and use charcoal. Soil separator can be used to keep the layer  of charcoal apart from the soilless mix. Use fibre glass drapery fabric, nylon  tights, sheer drapery, screening (not metal) or landscape fabric. Use sand in a  desert terrarium. Sand should be bagged, washed and free of salts. Leaf mold  can be used for woodland soil mixes but should be sterilized. Limestone can be  used, especially for desert terrariums. Bone meal can be used in desert  terrariums; do not use fertilizer in the initial planting.<br />
  <strong>Watering, ventilation and sun </strong><br />
				  When  your plants are all in position, the soil should be well watered. If you can do  this in the kitchen sink or in the bathtub where you can give it a thorough  wetting and then allow the excess to drain out, so much the better. The  frequency with which terrariums must be watered after they have been started  depends on how much ventilation they are given. Although opinions vary, it has  been our experience that the plants will prosper if they are kept covered  during the day and the top is partially slid off at night. If this system is  followed, we think you will find that your terrarium garden will need watering  only once every few months. Terrarium plants need sunlight, but in limited  amounts. An east or west window will do the trick, or a south facing location,  if there is a glass curtain between the window and the container.<br />
  <strong>Lighting</strong><br />
				  It's important that the plants receive bright, indirect  or dappled light. While direct sun will usually cook or sunburn the plants, too  much shade will cause stringy growth and poor colouration. Different plants  have different needs, but a good starting place is to use four fluorescent  tubes for a tank that is 12-14 inches wide. The length of the tubes should be  as long as the tank. 50% Gro-Lux® plant lights and 50% cool white, placed  alternating across the top are used. The lights should be barely above the tank  cover and the plants from 4-7 inches below the lights. Spot lights put out more  heat and less light and are not recommended. Natural sunlight can be used if it  is filtered through a sheer fabric, white plastic or partially shaded by other  plants that do not have large, broad leaves, (too dark). Watch your plants and  adjust the light as needed. Spindly, thin and stretched growth indicates not  enough light whereas pale yellow leaves with burned edges indicates too much  light. For those of you with light meters: place the sensor in the tank and  under the cover. When the sun or lights are illuminating the terrarium, an  average candlepower runs from 500-800 using natural light, and from 400-600  using the above fluorescent lights. High Pressure Sodium and Metal Halide are  usually at 600-850 foot candles. These general guidelines may need to be  adjusted according to what you are growing. In any case, do not let the lighting  run the terrarium temperature above 95°F.<br />
  <strong>Location</strong><br />
				  Location  of the terrarium will play a part, too. If it will be in a sunny place, succulents<strong> </strong>may work best. A succulent is a water retaining plant that does  well in arid conditions (e.g., jade plant, Christmas cactus, sedum). If the terrarium  will have a lot of shade and moisture, in a bathroom for instance, then ferns  and mosseswill most likely be a good  choice.<br />
  <strong>Terrarium tools</strong><strong> </strong><br />
				  Some  tools and terrarium supplies to plant your terrarium, especially if it has a  small or narrow mouth.</p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Tweezers  and long sticks</strong> can be used to dig holes, move items and  support plants while they are being planted.</li>
				  <li><strong>A  long, thin spoon</strong> will be helpful in placing soil and drainage  material in the container.</li>
				  <li>If a  container with a very small opening is used, make a <strong>funnel</strong> from paper or aluminum foil for placing soil into the  container.</li>
				  <li><strong>Household  scissors</strong> are handy for pruning plants before they are  planted.</li>
				  <li><strong>An  atomizer</strong> or bulb type sprayer will be useful for  spraying and watering plants in the terrarium.</li>
				  <li><strong>A  stick with a wire loop on the end</strong> is handy for lowering  plants into large terrariums with small tops.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Terrarium-work to be done</strong><br />
                    <strong>Laying the groundwork                                                                                                </strong></p>
				<p>The way you place the soil at the bottom of the  terrarium is extremely important. It should always be well drained. Start out  by placing large pieces of concave crocking over each of the drainage holes to  prevent the soil from leaking out. Then add an inch or so of good drainage  material. Follow this with another layer of a couple of inches of a good  potting mixture, such as those that can be bought in a garden supply store. It  should be filled in firmly, but not tamped down too tight. The soil should be  slightly damp, but not soaking wet. Then place the</p>
				<p>plants,  which should be ready nearby, by digging small holes large enough to  accommodate their balls of earth in a pleasing arrangement. <br />
                  <a name="materiaux" id="materiaux"></a><strong>Plants to grow </strong><br />
In  addition to lichens and mosses, a good many plants which grow in the open air  of your living room will prosper as well in miniature form in the terrarium. </p>

			      <p align="left"><strong>Maintenance</strong><br />
			        Any dead leaves or rotting plants in your plant terrarium  should be removed promptly with tweezers before the problem spreads to other  plants. If a fungus seems to be spreading from a plant through the growing  medium, remove a portion of the medium in the infected area and replace it.  Apply a general fungicide to reduce spread of the disease. General maintenance  required is,<br />
  <strong>1.  Moisture balance</strong><br />
			        After  planting an 'open' terrarium mist plants to clean them and to clean the glass  walls of the container. If using a 'closed' terrarium keep the lid off until  the plant foliage dries. The water in the bottom should not be more than 1 inch  deep in a terrarium after planting. Once the moisture cycle is established, it  is self perpetuating. Changes in light and heat are not likely to cause  problems in the long run. If moisture does not appear on the glass for over a  week, add some water. Most terrariums (if closed) need added water every 3 or 4  months.  Open terrariums require moisture  more frequently, but not as frequently as plants in pots.<br />
  <strong>2.  Plant growth</strong><br />
			        Pinch back  regularly to promote bushy growth. Prune woody growth to encourage compact  growth. Always cut back to leaf or branch joint. Remove plants if the terrarium  looks overgrown or if diseased or infested with insects.<br />
  <strong>3.  Temperature</strong><br />
			        Maintain  daytime temperature range of 65 - 80 degrees with a night-time temperature of  ten degrees lower. A sealed terrarium is protected against sudden temperature  changes, drafts or excessive dryness, as long as the environmental change does  not last longer than 48 hours.<br />
  <strong>4.  Light</strong><br />
			        If light  conditions are not ideal, the plants will stretch or look too pale. Direct  light is required for desert terrariums with no lid. Indirect strong light  (east or west facing window) is excellent for tropical or woodland terrariums  or up to 1.5 m away from a south facing window. Medium light is acceptable for  woodland or tropical terrariums (1.5 to 4 m away from south, east or west  facing windows). Low light is used for low light tropic plants (4 to 6 m away  from sunny windows and 1.5 to 3 m away from north, east or west windows).<br />

			      <p align="left" ><strong>Types of terrariums</strong><br />
                      <strong>The upside down terrarium </strong><br />
			        This is a unique little terrarium that looks great. But  it was quite a challenge to figure out how to do it right.  Filling it with the materials like soil,  stone and seeds then flipping it over real quick didn't work. The sides got  dirty. All the standard terrarium making materials are used. It includes soil,  seeds, spagnum moss and pearl stone for drainage. The trick is getting them in  the top of the bottle or jug without getting dirt on the sides.<br />
  <strong>Apothecary jar terrariums </strong><br />
			        These jars make stylish and very attractive terrariums  and they are small enough for a beginner with a large mouth for easy access.  Apothecary jars make great containers for terrariums. They are attractive  looking, reasonably sized and have a large mouth for easy access. If you want a  good looking and easy to make terrarium this is a great way to go. <br />
  <strong>Moss terrarium </strong><br />
			        Moss terrariums have become very popular lately. Mosses  could be collected from the local cemeteries, wooded areas and <strong>special note and caution</strong> about using any kind of external  plant, rock or wood piece in your terrariums: Moss, Rocks, Plants, Wood pieces  from the outside world can carry insects with them. Or even insect eggs that  you can't see. Immediately these should not be added to any indoor plant or  terrarium. First we should quarantine them in a sealed transparent container  for up to a month. This way we can see if anything develops or any eggs hatch. </p>

			          <li>Shady  Spots - the moss in sunny areas was often brown and unhealthy. </li>
			          <li>Angled  and slanted areas (they seemed to grow well on the sides of small hills).</li>
			          <li>This  could be a water preference. On a slanted location the moss will get water only  for a short period of time which is rather interesting, this leads us to  believe the moss will do well with frequent but very light watering.</li>

			      <p align="left"><strong>Desert themed terrarium </strong><br />
			        This kind of terrarium is attractive, fun to make and very hardy.  Here is a complete tutorial on how to make one. A Desert themed terrarium is a fun project to make and it  is something that is relatively easy to care for. A variety of cacti and  succulents which don't require a lot of water and are very tolerant of sunlight  are used. This kind of terrarium can also be done in an open dish which is  easier to make than in a closed container. <br />
  <strong>Carnivorous terrariums</strong><br />
			        Growing  carnivorous plants in the home requires the mimicking of their natural  environment so that they thrive. As carnivorous plants usually grow in extreme  conditions it is more challenging to do this for carnivorous plants that for  most other house plants. The majority of these plants grow in areas where the  soil is extremely acidic and often very wet such as in bogs, or in soils that  lack most of the nutrients that most plants need. Bright light is required by  most carnivorous plants. For artificially lit terrariums use fluorescent rather  than incandescent bulbs to prevent overheating. <br />
			        STYLES OF GARDEN<br />
			        Man was able to harmonize with the external environment <em>viz.</em>, nature in as much as he was in  harmony with the internal environment <em>viz.</em>,  self composed of feeling and desire. The civilization of the present and the  recent past made the globe as village through its advancement in science and  technology, isolated the human race from the nature externally and alienated  the self internally. The nature has been exploited to the core for bodily  pleasures and the self has been ignored, leading to the deterioration in the  psychic, which lost righteous and reason.<br />
			        To make  the self to be in tune with the body and the body in tune with the nature,  there has come the necessity to create artificial pleasure gardens, psychic  gardens and biological gardens. <br />
  <strong>Hindu  type of garden</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Vanams in the earlier period served  the purpose of a garden and was synonymous with garden.  Vanams were the natural gardens furnished by  the mother earth for the humans and animals to dwell on and inhabit in such  vanams were put to various uses by the various sections of the society.  Vanavasam was part of the life of Vikrmaditya,  Rama and Pandavas.  The great sages  reside only in vanams to attain spiritual bliss.<br />
  <strong>Rajavanam</strong><br />
			        Area of natural forest exclusively  meant for the ruler or kings to hunt wild animals.  More than hunting, it was the time spent in  hunting that is relaxing in real sense.   Latter on four kinds of Rajavanams came into existence.</p>
			      <div align="left">
			        <ol>
			          <li><strong>Promododyan</strong>: Private garden fro king and queen  exclusively.  It would get attached to  the forts when queen resided.<strong></strong></li>
			          <li><strong>Udayan</strong>: A vanam where the kings passed their  leisure time in playing chess, enjoying dance and listening to music.<strong></strong></li>
			          <li><strong>Vriksha  vatika</strong>: a vanam meant  for ministers and courtiers where they made merry with courtesans.<strong></strong></li>
			          <li>Special gardens dedicated to God with  water pools studded with lotuses and lilies.<strong></strong></li>
		            </ol>
		          </div>
			      <p align="left"><strong>Tapovanam</strong><br />
                      <strong>            </strong>It was meant for sages and hermits who  would proper to be in tone with nature and meditate to explore the self and the  universal god head.  Tapovanams would  have the trees of spiritual significance.</p>
			      <div align="left">
			        <ol>

			      <p align="left"><strong>Brindavanam</strong><br />
			        It means a place of eternal  bliss.  It is supposed to be the advanced  version of tapovanam.  It is a natural  abode where the sages relinquish their physical body and attain radiant body  (Nirvikalpa Samadhi) and the soul part of the body conjoins with the  absolute.  God head in eternal  ectacy.  Eg: Arvind Ashram, Pondicherry;  Mantralayam of Ragavendra and Ramana and Seshadri brindavans at  Tiruvannamalai.  Trees with showy,  colourful flowers to express the absolute joy would be grown in Brindavans.<br />
  <strong>Asokavanam</strong><br />
			        It was a place or a garden where  royal ladies like queens and princess relax.   Asoka trees (<em>Saraca indica</em>)  were grown in woodlots.  The down flowing  coppery leaves of <em>Saraca</em> would  suggest to royal ladies that their kings would return with triumph and pacify  their emotionally imbalanced heart.<br />
  <strong>Nandavanams</strong> <br />
			        They are small gardens established  around village temples.  There the flowering  shrubs whose flowers can be offered to various deities are grown for daily  rituals. Eg: <em>Tauberna  montana coronana, Hibiscus, Tecoma, Nerium, Occimum sanctum, jasmines, </em>etc.</p>

                      <li>The  cult of animal and tree worship was at its peak.</li>
                      <li>The  tree of pipal (<em>Ficus religiosa</em>) and  banyan (<em>Ficus bengalensis</em>) served  mankind and fauna in many different ways and they were considered as the symbol  of fertility.</li>

                    It existed during 1600 BC.  Aryavartha means the country of lotus and  sunshine.  Lotus signifies the soul and  the sun signifies the Godheads.  The  blooming lotus on the radiating sun’s arms symbolizes the ultimate purpose of  human life<em>,</em> the soul’s unification  with God.</p>

                    Ramayan narrates unending list of  trees, shrubs, creepers, etc. which were in use for adornment and also as seen  wild in nature.<br />
                    Mahabarat embodies names of various  vegetation and flowers along with Kurkshetra war.  In Pathu pattu, the names of 99 flowers have  been mentioned at a stretch as having collected by the lady who awaited her  would be who was yet to make  his  presence.<br />
                    Kalidasa’s poetic description of  nature was vivid in Sakuntalam in which there was a metaphor on a twining  Madhavi lata (<em>Hiptage madablota</em>) on a  mango tree indicating the sweet, supple womanhood through the vine and the  youthful vigour through the tree.  The  Megha sandesam and Regu vamsam were full of descriptions of vegetation between  Ujjain and alpine Himalayas.<br />
                    Very frequent references were made  about flowers in folklores right from birth ceremony to the death rituals which  indicates the association of flowers with social life.<br />
  <strong>Buddhist Type</strong><br />
                    Lord Buddha preached the concept of  ‘thoughtlessness’ (Nirvana) as the only remedy for human misery caused by the  desire part of the self which resides in the physical bodies a divine force.<br />
                    Thoughtlessness can be achieved not  by suppressing the ‘desire’ but by exploring the desire within.</p>
				  <p align="left">‘Exploring  within’ would be possible only when one’s mind is detached from the senses and  tries to identify the self within.<br />
				    Buddhist gardens were so designed  that no component will excite the senses and such gardens were established  around vihars and latter came to be known as Amaravanams.<br />
  <strong>The key features are</strong></p>
				  <div align="left">
				    <ol>
				      <li>No  artificial structures would be put up in any form.</li>
				      <li>No  one will pluck the flower to offer to the lord.   Only the fallen flowers alone are collected and offered to the Lord.</li>
				      <li>Mostly,  the trees with white and saffron coloured flowering trees were preferred and  planted.</li>
				      <li>The  trees shouldn’t invite birds either for nesting or for eating the edible fruits  as the sound of birds may disrupt the silence.</li>
				      <li>Extreme  silence should be ensured in the garden so that one could enjoy meditation  peacefully.</li>
				      <li>Life  of Buddha had been identified with trees and flowers.</li>
				      <ol>
				        <li>According  to Hiuen, Tsang, Budha was born in 563 BC under the tree of Ashoka at Lumbini.</li>
				        <li>He  attained enlightment under the tree of pipal at Gaya.</li>
				        <li>He  preached the first sermon of his religion under mango tree at Saranath  (Varanasi).</li>

				      <li>During  Ashoka’s period, avenue planting on road was given priority (264 – 227 BC).</li>
				      <li>He  wrote the messages of Buddha on stupa; in which a pipal tree, wheel and lotus  were also carved.</li>

				    The success of Japan is to be  attributed to the self knowledge or the knowledge of the ‘self’ which is  inner.  Self knowledge can often be used  to make the other party to like your agenda for action.  It can be used to punish, reward, persuade  and even transform an enemy into an ally.   Best of all, with the right self knowledge, one can circumvent nasty  situations so as to avoid wasting force or wealth altogether.<br />
				    With all modern, advanced electronic  gadgets available to make the day to day life highly mechanical, the Japanese  life is still undisturbed and social fabric is still vital and vibrating with  human tendencies.  This has been  attributed to the fact that their way of life stems from internal power, the  power of the self; the external developments are kept at check by the internal  power of self.<br />
				    The internal power of the ‘self’ is  understood and harnessed by meditation of the body.  Every individual meditates and thus the  entire nation to bring out the best of human on the intellectual arena.<br />
				    Japanese gardens type is nature in  miniature which enables them to meditate, be in harmony with nature even while  they are busy with daily routines.<br />

                  <p align="left"><strong>Forms of Japanese type</strong><br />
                      <strong>A) HILL GARDEN</strong><br />
				    The main features of hill garden are  hills, streams and ponds along with other features<br />
  <strong>1)  Ornamental water</strong><br />
				    Water is the life of the garden and  necessary feature of Japanese hill gardens.   It may be present in the form of big lakes with a calm tranquil surface  or symbolically in the form of water basins of natural shape.<br />
				    Waterfall is another means to bring  the natural setting into a garden.  A  group of stones is raised and water is allowed to fall from it naturally.  The trees are planted in front of the place  where waterfalls.  Wells serve a dual  purpose for beauty as well as utility.<br />
  <strong>2) Islands</strong><br />
				    Islands are important feature and  are located in the middle of the pond.   Rocks are used for foundation of island and soil is deposited on  it.  Then trees are planted and stones are  erected in an irregular manner to give natural touch.  Islands many be connected by a bridge or left  isolated.<br />
				    Different islands are formed because  hills, lakes and islands are complementary beauties.  They are given personal touch by naming them  as master island, guest island and central island.<br />
  <strong>3) Hills and hillocks</strong><br />
				    A  bigger sized broad viewed hill forms the main feature (hill 1).  Secondary to it, a lower hill is created  adjacent to hill 1 and is called companion hill (hill 2).  A lower hill 3 is projected front opposite to  hill 1.  Hill 4 is elegantly introduced  in the foreground close to hill 3 and below hill 2.  At the far end, hill 5 is to be located which  could be seen from all parts of the garden.<br />
  <strong>4) Stones</strong></p>
                  <p align="left">The  stone structures are used to depict different natural moods, ideas of spiritual  and melodic.   There are 5 such types of  stones as described below:</p>
                  <div align="left">
                    <ol>
                      <li>Status stone: A tall vertical stone bulging  out towards middle and finishing at the top suggesting a human at thinking or  meditating.</li>
                      <li>Low vertical stone: is rounded at the base  and its top is bent resembling the bud of magnolia.</li>
                      <li>Flat stone: is a low broad stone of irregular  shape with a flat top suggesting submissiveness.</li>
                      <li>Recumbent or ox stone: resembles trunk of an  animal.  Its long curved and bent boulder  suggests an animal hiding in a bush.</li>
                      <li>Arching stone: is arch like as its name  indicates and suggests flexibility in thought.</li>
                      <li>The above stones can be grouped into two,  three or four to give different meanings as below:</li>
                    </ol>
                  </div>
                  <p align="left">      a)   Three  stones placed at the edge        = long  life stone of beach<br />
                    b)   Two  stones o the bank of lake            =  Good luck stone or river<br />
                    Such stones are located in ten positions  in a hill garden most central (Guardian stone), opposite to the fall (companion  stone), foreground centre (worshipping stone), foreground left (interviewing  stone), foreground right (waiting stone), between two hills (man shadow stone),  near central group of trees (cave stone), at the heart of the garden (seat of  honour stone), 1st stepping stone (pedestal stone) and pair of  stones near entrance (idling stones).<br />
  <strong>5) Trees</strong><br />
                    Trees are planted with certain objectives  and have been given specific names.</p>
                  <div align="left">
                    <ol>
                      <li><strong>Principal  tree:</strong> Group of trees planted at the central part of  background.</li>
                      <li><strong>View  perfecting tree: </strong>A tree planted in the foreground of an  island.</li>
                      <li><strong>Tree  of solitude:</strong> Group of trees with thick foliage in the  background on one side.</li>
                      <li><strong>Cascade screening tree:</strong> Group of bushy or leafy tree planted at the side of waterfall to hide the  portion of it.</li>
                      <li><strong>Tree  of setting sun:</strong>            is  planted in the west side to filter the glare of setting sun.</li>
                      <li><strong>Distancing tree:</strong> Pine plants planted to give a forest look.</li>
                    </ol>
                  </div>
                  <p align="left"><strong>6) Garden lanterns</strong><br />
                    Stone and bronze lanterns were used  to decorate Buddhist temples.  They  became the thing of beauty in gardens also.   Standard lanterns or legged lanterns or stone lanterns are used in an  informal manner to decorate the garden.<br />
  <strong>7) Garden pagoda</strong><br />
                    It may be in the form of stone tower or  pagoda.  The roof may have three, five or  seven a nine or eleven separate roots.<br />
  <strong>8) Garden bridges</strong><br />
                    There are made of natural wood of stone  varying in size and width.  They are used  to connect islands.  Either single stone  or many pieces have been used to make the bridges sometime, semicircular  arch.  Form of bridges is constructed on  the special ponds to permit the passage of boats under it.  The bridges are named as wooden trestle  bridge, ‘peeping’ bridge, ‘granite slat bridge’ curved bracket bridge, Chinese  full moon bridge, etc.<br />
  <strong>B) JAPANESE TEA GARDENS</strong><br />
                    In Japanese the tea ceremony has gained  the status of national ceremony and has been intricately woven with life  style.  A glimpse of tea room or more  sitting at tea room for a while itself is a, pleasant experience.  Mat floor and wooden walls with all bamboo  works.  Pale brown is the colour everywhere.  Two ‘L’ shaped benches and in front of which  a sturdy but long tea poi.<br />
                    No one should talk or gossip during tea  ceremony.  Even those who walk, conduct  themselves in such a way that no noise is produced.  It is really breathless silence as if one is in  front of Emperor or Religious heads.<br />
                    Tea is boiling in a vessel at one corner  and a middle aged lady looks after the tea.   The vessels are artistically made.   The vessels are cleaned by with silk towel.  The lady pretends as if she is cleaning the  vessel since it has already been cleaned.   The pretension is something like that of abhinaya bhava in Indian  Bharatanatyam.  Some other girl enters  the room and she handles the cup and saucer.   She cleans the cup and saucer and places them before the guests.  The guest looks the inside as well as the  outer surface very carefully.  She just  smiles and nodes her head towards the guest seated next.  The next guest does the same careful look and  passes it to the next.  The process  continues till all guests have a look of the cup and saucer.  Such a dead slow process is the key feature  of the tea ceremony as it makes one to be silent and the mind is attentive to  the saucer alone.  The mind is detached  from the daily chores of high speed.   Almost is another form of meditation to harness the power from inner  self.<br />
                    Then, in a tissue paper, an edible item is  provided.  The eatable is taken along  with the tissue paper and while eating, the tissue paper hides the facial  expression which is considered as unethical in Japanese life more than the  taste of the stuff, the way in which it is eaten is curious to look at.<br />
                    Tea is provided finally.  It is green tea.  The tea has to be sipped with extreme silence  by the guests and after saying thanks in Japanese style, one is expected to  leave.<br />
                    Sometimes the tea is served outside in a  garden which is called as Tea garden.   Tea garden is just the nature recreated in miniature in front of the  house.  A path leads from garden to tea  hall which is as specified by ancestors.   Before one makes entry into the tea room in a garden, one should clean  himself in the water kept in unsized  granite troughs.<br />
                    Such tea ceremony has been introduced into  Japan by Zen-Buddhist monks.  ‘Zen’ is a  word derived from Tamil word ‘Thianum’.   Bodhi Dharma introduced the system of ‘Thianum’ (meditation) through tea  ceremony.  Not only the common people but  also the Emperors and rulers followed the Zen.   The philosophy of perseverance learnt whatever worst may happen; doing  the duties meticulously; cleanliness, softness and sweetness become basic principles  of Japanese society.<br />
                    To attain such a mental poise, tea  ceremony happens to be training. An example for the effect of mediation on  mundane life is that the army should divert its course of march if a flower  happens to be in the path enroot.  It may  be the symbolism of how a monk conducts himself to go and meet the Bodhi  Dharma, the chief monk at the sanctum sanitarium and receive spiritual  message.  Tea decoction was considered to  help meditation in those days.<br />
                    The present day Japanese tea garden is  sectioned into three areas <em>viz</em>., sotoroji  (outer section), machi (middle section) and uchiroji (inner section).<br />
  <strong>Outer section</strong> <br />
                    The guests are supposed to wait after  removing shoes.  Paths will be provided  with stepping stones to lead to middle section.   Stone benches of irregular size are provided and the area is not planted  with many kinds of plants except grasses.<br />
  <strong>Middle section</strong><br />
  <strong>      </strong>Stone troughs with water are kept for  the guests to clean themselves before making entry into the inner section.  Here also the stepping stones and naturally  looking objects are located in an unkempt manner.<br />
  <strong>Inner garden</strong> <br />
                    It is extremely simple and natural stones,  lanterns, rocks water basins which look as antiques are placed.  The trees, shrubs, annual and grasses are put  in an informal manner.  A rustic well  compete with lever, rope, bucket, pulley etc. is an essential feature of inner  garden.  Hedge walls are provided to look  natural.  Stones <em>viz</em>., kettle stone, front stone, sword hanging stones, candle stick  stone and low basin stone are kept in an informal manner.      <br />
                    The selection of trees is such that when  the outer garden is exposed to the light the inner must be darkened by shady  evergreen trees.<br />
                    In India, tea type Japanese garden exist  at Kamala retreat of Mr. Singhniq, Kanpur; Roshanara Garden, New Delhi and Mrs.  Indira Gandhi personal residence garden.<br />
  <strong>C) FLAT GARDENS</strong><br />
                    Flat gardens lack ups and down and devoid  of hills, streams and ponds.  They are  created for confined places and are secondary in importance.  Mostly Moore type gardens are developed to  create scenic beauty, other adornments like stones, well, water basin, tree,  etc. are used.  Water current of an ocean  effect is produced by covering the land surface with pure sand.  The rocks or pebbles are so arranged that  they give an effect of diversion or rush or water.<br />
  <strong>The key features of Japanese type</strong></p>
                  <div align="left">
                    <ol>
                      <li>They  are nature recreated in miniature.</li>

                      <li>The  natural elements like, mountains, islands, rivers, lakes, streams, bridges are  made use of as components.</li>
                    </ol>
                  </div>
                  <p align="left"><strong>PERSIAN GARDEN</strong><br />
                    Water was central feature of garden design  with religious symbolism; water occupied the space and interpenetrated from the  open court into the enclosures.<br />
                    The Islamic view of heaven or Paradise is  a beautiful garden and the day of judgment will take place in gardens of  pleasure complete with cooling springs and fountains.<br />
                    The traditional Persian garden was  composed of four essentials as below:</p>
                  <div align="left">
                    <ol>
                      <li>Water for irrigation, display and sound</li>
                      <li>Shade trees for shelter</li>
                      <li>Flowers for scent and colour </li>
                      <li>Music to delight the ears
<p>      A typical garden is a quadrant pattern  with water channels dividing the garden into four sections and this design is  called as <strong>Char Bagh Design.</strong>  There was usually a pool or small hill with a  pavilion at the intersection of the channels.<br />
                          Desert of West Asia influenced the Persian  type and functions of garden.  The garden  is a place to escape from the harsh aridity of desert.  Shade trees and fruit trees were grown in  four square plots as in Persian carpet.   Scented flower were accepted in Persian gardens.<br />
  <strong>MOGHUL GARDENS</strong><br />
                          The great Moghul Emperor Babur had high  aesthetic sense and was fond of gardens.   Garden of Panipet and Arambagh garden at Agra are still maintained.  Moghul gardens are synonymous of formal style  of gardening which is an extended dian of primitive Persian garden is Char Bagh design.  The same style of gardening was preserved by  Moghul descendents.<br />

                          Being architecturally suburb,  aesthetically designed, and harmonically planted, they create breathtaking  sight. Broadly Moghul gardens can be categorised into two:  i) Pleasure gardens of Kings and Queens ii)  Tomb garden.  The former gardens were  made with the sole purpose of pleasure of King and Queen and family members whereas  the latter gardens were attached to tombs of King or Queen for giving peace to  soul.<br />
  <strong>General features</strong> </p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Gardens  are formal in style; symmetrically planned with rectangular or square plots.</li>

                      The English garden admirers were  impressed by the contemporary developments in Italy and France but they refused  to be dazzled.  The elaborate parterre  (pattern) that enjoyed in Italian and French gardens found no favour in  England.  In its place, there developed a  peculiar and very characteristic knot gardens or British gardens.<br />
                      English gardens are most beautiful  garden among all European gardens.  The  reasons are:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>The  UK enjoys the typical grassland climate with well distributed rainfall.  This is favourable for the growth of  herbaceous perennials.</li>
                      <li>Since  they were ruling many countries, valuable plant collection was possible from  diverse areas.</li>
                      <li>Gardening  is a high cost technology and British were rich enough to afford luxury.</li>
                      <li>Britishers  are very fond of flowers.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Stages of development</strong><br />
                        <strong>14th century</strong><br />
                        <strong>         </strong>Monks introduced garden craft in  England.  They were planted with fruits,  vegetables with a sole purpose of getting food for monasteries and herbs for  medicinal purpose.<br />
                        <strong>16th century</strong><br />
                        <strong>         </strong>Gardens consisted of symmetrical walks  of clipped evergreens, statutory and masonry metal stages, statues of Greek  gods were scaled on architectural fantasies.</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Introduction  of various exotic plants though new trading companies.</li>
                      <li>Flower  garden got a special stimulus.</li>
                      <li>Formal  in design with topiary and carpet garden.</li>

                    <p>They  key features of British garden in India are: i) Lawn  ii) Rockery   and iii) herbaceous border.<br />
                        <strong>i) Lawn</strong> <br />
                      To day grass lawn is a principal  feature of English garden.  A lawn can be  any shape and it may be plain or undulating.   It can be laid by seed, turfing or plastering.<br />
  <strong>ii) Rockery</strong> <br />
                      It is the second important feature of  an English garden.  The colourful rockery  with true rock plants which is not found in plains of India.</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>A  regular design is not required for making rockery.</li>
                      <li>There  are four types of rockeries.</li>
                      <li>Cold weather rockery of annuals like <em>Alyssum, Calendula, Candytuft, Dianthus,  Ageratum, Gailardia, Verbena, Zinnia.</em></li>

                        <strong>         </strong>Flower beds or borders are  characteristic feature a British garden.   The height of the plant, time, duration and overall colour scheme are  taken into consideration.</p>
                    <ol>

                    <p><strong>Colour  scheme</strong><br />
                      The  natural and most pleasing colour scheme is the one that we observe in the  rainbow.  The order is Violet, Indigo, Blue,  Green, Yellow, Orange and Red.  If this  is followed in flower beds, it would please many, but personal liking and  individual taste differ with temperament.   In nature, the primary colours are Red, Yellow and Blue.  All other colours are combination of these  colours.<br />
                      Flower  beds of mixed colours can be introduced when required colour is not  available.  ‘Dot plants’ are put in  harmoniously planted places to break the monotony.  They should be conspicuously coloured plants  such as red, black and blue.<br />
  <strong>Hue</strong>     <strong>:</strong> Pure colour with no addition of black  or white<br />
  <strong>Tint</strong>     <strong>:</strong> Lightening of basic hue by addition  of white<br />
  <strong>Shade</strong> <strong>:</strong> Deepening of basic colour by addition  of black<br />
  <strong>Tone</strong>   <strong>:</strong> A chromatic change of pure hue by  addition of black and white <em>ie.,</em> Grey.<br />
  <strong>Value</strong>  <strong>:</strong> Describes the colour intensity of  hue.<br />
  <strong>Colour  scheme</strong><br />
  <strong>i)  Monotone</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The use of one hue only but utilizing the full gamut of  all its tints, shades and tones create a complementary harmony.<br />
  <strong>ii)  Complementary</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The use of two colours directly opposite to each other  one the colour wheel plus their respective tints, shades and tones create a  complementary harmony.<br />
  <strong>iii)  Analogues</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Neighboring colours are in harmony with each other  because they have a common denominator.<br />
                      Eg:  Blue and Violet:  Both contain blue<br />
                      Red and Orange:  Both contain red.<br />
                      Preferably two neighboring colours are  utilized and at times three.<br />
  <strong>iv)Triadic</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>It is the use of three colours in the triangle Yellow,  Red and Blue, or Violet, Orange and Green.<br />
  <strong>Latest  developments in British type</strong><br />
                      In  the last century, the most conspicuous new development was the emphasis laid on  lawns.  The lawn become larger and more  perfect, however, the old heritage of sundry elements of garden composition was  not given up.<br />
                      Up  to the time of Sir William Kent, the gardens had definite form and enclosure of  some sort.<br />
                      But  William Kent, thought garden as a part of whole landscape view.</p>
