				<p><strong>Brinjal - </strong><strong>(Syn:  Egg plant) (Solanum melongena L.) (2n = 24) Hindi: Banigan)</strong><br />
				  Brinjal  is one of the most common tropical vegetables grown in India. It is known by  different names like aubergine (French), begun (Bengali), ringna (Gujarathi),  baingan (Hindi) badane (Kannada), waangum (Kashmiri), vange (Marathi), baigan  (Hindi) badane (Kannada), waangum (Kashmiri), vange (Marathi), baigan (Oriya),  Vashuthana (Malayalam), Kathiri (Tamil), venkaya (Telugu) and Peethabhala  (Sanskrit). A large number of cultivars differing in size, shape and colour of  fruits are grown in India. Immature fruits are used in curries and a variety of  dishes are prepared out of brinjal. Fruits are moderate sources of vitamins and  minerals like phosphorous, calcium and iron and nutritive value varies from  variety to variety.<br />
				  Brinjal  is also valued for its medicinal properties and has got decholestrolizing  property primarily due to presence of poly-unsaturated fatty acids (linoleic  and lenolenic) present in flesh and seeds of fruit in higher amount (65.1%).  Presence of magnesium and potassium salt in fruits also impart  de-cholestrolizing action. In native medicines, role of brinjal in treatment of  liver diseases, cough due to allergy, rheumatism, colilithiasis, leucorrhea and  intestinal worms has been mentioned.<br />
  <strong>Origin and distribution</strong><br />
				  Brinjal  is originated in Indo- Burma region (Vavliov, 1926). Crop is distributed in  south and south East Asia, southern Europe, China and Japan. India is the  second largest producer of brinjal in the world next to China and produces  83.47 lakh tonnes from an area of 5.02 lakh ha. Cultivation of brinjal is  maximum in Orissa, West Bengal, Bihar and is also distributed in almost all  states.<br />
				  Taxonomy  Genus Solanum comprises approximately 2000 species, which include both tuber  bearing and non-tuber bearing forms. Important edible species under non-tuber  bearing forms are S. melongena, S. torvum, S. nigrum, S. macrocarpom, S. ferox  and S. aethiopicum<br />
  <strong><em>S.  torvum</em></strong><strong> –</strong> used for its small clustered fruits for curry purpose  and for drying. It is grown as a wild plant in backyards and roadsides. Due to  its resistance to Fusarium wilt and bacterial wilt, S. torvum can be a  resistant root stock for grafting cultivated S. melongena<br />
				  <strong><em>S. macrocarpom and S.aethiopicum</em> –</strong> grown for edible fruits and leaves.<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

				  Several  species of Solanum are used in native medicines through out tropics. <em>S. melongena var. insanum, S. incanum, S. indicum, S.</em> <em>viarum</em> are a few among them.<br />
				  Studies  on inter-specific hybridization revealed incompatibility between cultivated <em>S. melongena</em> with other species, except  with <em>S. incanum</em>. Further taxonomic  studies revealed that <em>S. incanum</em> is  only a variety under <em>S. melongena</em> and  can be treated as <em>S. melongena var.  incanum</em>.<br />
				  Based on growth habit and fruit  shape, four botanical varieties are reported under <em>S.melongena</em>.<br />
                  <em>            S.melongena var. melongena</em> (Syn: <em>S.melongena</em> var. <em>Esculen</em>ta Nees) includes cultivars with round  and egg shaped fruits<br />
                  <em>            S.melongena var serpentinum</em> Desf. Includes long and  slender fruited cultivars<br />
                  <em>           S.melongena var. depressum</em> includes early and dwarf cultivars<br />

                  <strong>Botany</strong></p>
				<p>Brinjal is a diploid with 2n=2x=24. Plant is  erect, semi erect or prostrate, herbaceous and branched with around 1.0m  height. Stem is spiny or non spiny with or without purple pigmentation which is  due to anthocyanin. Flowers are bisexual, pentamerous and are solitary or in  2-7 flowered cyme. Calyx is persistent and spiny or non spiny. Corolla is lobed  with different shapes and purple, light pink or white coloured. Stamens are  free and form a loose cone surroundings the style. Dehiscence is poricidal.  Ovary is bilocular with many ovules. Heterostyly is very common. Fruit is a  berry with wide variation in shape, colour and size. Fruit</p>
				<p>shape  may be long, oval, round, ovoid, cylindrical or elongated. Fruit colour may be  nearly black, different shapes of purple, white, green or variegated. <img width="1" height="1" src="lec05_clip_image003.gif" /><br />
                  <img width="312" height="231" src="lec05_clip_image005.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /><strong>Flower biology and pollination</strong><br />
				  Though  reported as a self pollinated crop, cross pollination to varying degree has  been reported in brinjal. Cross pollination is due to its heteromorphic flower  structure and is mainly by honey bees and bumble bees.<br />
				  Depending  on length of style in relation to position of anthers, four types of flowers –  heterostyly are available.<br />
				  Long styled –  stigma well above the anthers<br />
				  Medium styled  – stigma and anthers at same level<br />
				  Short styled –  style short<br />
				  Pseudoshort  styled – style rudimentary<br />
				  Fruit  set in long styled flowers ranges from 60 to 70% whereas in medium styled  flowers it is 12.5 to 55.6%. Short styled and pseudoshort styled flowers act as  male flowers and there is no fruit.<br />
				  Opening  of flower and dehiscence of anthers are almost simultaneous and it takes place  at 6-7.30 am during summer and is delayed up to 11 am during winter. Flowering  depends on climatic factors and high temperature and humidity in the morning hasten  flower opening and dehiscence of anthers. In addition to climatic factors,  fertility level of the soil also influences flower initiation and development. <br />
                  <strong>Climate</strong><br />
				  Brinjal  is warm season day neutral plant and is susceptible to severe frost. A long and  warm growing season with a temperature range of 21-270C is ideal for its  production. Crop is adversely affected by chilling temperature of winter in  North India. Generally late cultivars can withstand low temperature than early  ones. Plants grown luxuriantly and yield heavily during rainy season under warm  humid climatic condition of Kerala.<br />
                  <strong>Soil</strong><br />
				  Brinjal is a hardy crop and is  cultivated under a wide range of soils. Since a long duration crop with high  yield, well-drained and fertile soil is preferred for the crop. Crops grown in  sandy soils yield early and those grown in clayey soils yield more. Ideal pH  for cultivation of crop is 5.5-6.6<br />
                  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
				  A  large number of cultivars and improved varieties differing in size, shape and  colour of fruits are grown in India. Since consumer preference varies from  region to region and from district to district, judicious selection of  varieties plays an important role in success of brinjal cultivation. Quite a  large numbers of local cultivars like Banaras Giant, Wayanad Giant, Mukthakeshi  and Manjiri Gota are grown in specific areas. <br />
				  Fruits of some local cultivars  exhibit bitterness due to presence of glycolalkaloids like solanin. Generally  glycol-alkaloid content varies from 0.37 to 4.83 mg/ 100g in most of cultivars.  High glycol –alkaloids (20 mg/100g fresh weight) produces bitter taste and off  flavour. Varieties also vary for content of polyphenol oxidase which imparts  brown discoloration when the fruits are cut open.<br />
				  Pest and disease resistant/ tolerant  varieties with upright and sturdy growth habit, high yield, fruits with soft  flesh, low seediness, low solanin content and attractive glossy skin are  generally preferred for commercial cultivation. <br />

				<p><strong>Exploitation of Heterosis</strong><br />
            Brinjal continues to be a choice of  breeders for exploitation of heterosis due to hardy nature of crop,  comparatively large size of flowers and large number of seeds in a single fruit  enabling production of a large number of F1 seeds with a single act of  pollination. Highly varied consumer acceptance from region to region also  demands for development of a large number of high yielding F1 hybrids. Hand  emasculation and pollination are still followed in the hybrid seed production  of brinjal. Quite a large number of heterotic hybrids are developed in ICAR  institutes and State Agricultural universities and details are furnished below:</p>

				<p>            <br />
				  In addition, a large number of F1  hybrids are marketed by private seed companies. Supriya, Suphal (IAHS),  Kalpatharu, Ravaiya (Mahyco), Kanhaiya, Novkiran, Pragati (Sungro Seeds),  Apsara, Nisha (Namdhari) etc are a few commercial hybrids popular among  farmers.<br />
  <strong>Season</strong><br />
				  In  hills, brinjal is sown during March and transplanted during April. In,lains  there are three seasons for growing brinjal.<br />
  <strong>Autumn-winter crop</strong><br />
				  Crop  is sown in June and transplanted in July Spring -summer crop: Crop is sown in  early November and transplanted in January-February. Due to low temperature,  seedlings take 6 to 8 weeks for attaining normal size for transplanting and  nursery beds are to be protected from frost.<br />
  <strong>Rainy season crop</strong><br />
				  Seeds  are sown in March-April and transplanted during April-May. Being a low priced  vegetable, rainy season crop is the most economical in many parts. <br />
  <strong>Sowing </strong><br />
				  Seeds  are sown in nursery bed and transplanted to main field after four weeks during  summer and after 7 to 8 weeks during winter, when it is 8 - 10 cm tall.  Depending on growth of varieties and seasons of cultivation, 300 to 3:500 g  seeds are required for one hectare. Since brinjal seedlings grow fast,  sufficient care must be taken to sow seeds as thin or loose as possible.  Hardened seedlings withstand transplanting shock better and establish well in  main field. <br />
  <strong>Main field preparation and  transplanting </strong><br />
				  Proper  drainage is essential for growth of brinjal. Soil should be prepared to a fine  tilth by 4 to 6 ploughings. FYM should be incorporated in soil at the time of  final ploughing. Seedlings .are transplanted in levelled land in plots of convenient  size for irrigation. It may be grown on raised beds/ ridges during rainy  season. In undulating land, in order to avoid soil erosion, small pits are dug  at the point of planting and seedlings are planted. <br />
				  Spacing  depends on variety, season and fertility of soil. For long duration spreading  varieties, a spacing of 75-90cm x 60-75 cm and for bushy and non-spreading  varieties a distance of 45-60cm on either side are given. For early and less  spreading varieties, paired row planting is advantages due to, easiness in  harvesting and other cultural operations.<br />
  <strong>Manures and fertilizers </strong><br />
				  Brinjal  is a long duration crop with high yield potential. Flower and fruit production  will be adversely affected when crop is grown under low fertility conditions.  Depending on availability, 25 tonnes of FYM/ha may be incorporated in soil at  the time of final ploughing. Application of wet cow dung as a band, 10 -12 cm  away from the plant, followed by earthing up at fortnightly interval during  rainy season is a common practice for high productivity in Kerala. </p>
				<p>Fertilizer requirement of crop varies with  variety, season and type of soil. Fertilizer requirement for targeted  production in Co-2 under Tamil Nadu condition is estimated and 7.6 kg N, 1.4 kg  P and 17.3 kg K/ha are required to produce one tonnes of fruits. Fertilizer  studies at various centres of AICRP (Vegetables) indicated varying results.  Under Bangalore condition, 150 kg N and 100 Kg P20S were optimum while at Hisar  it was 100 kg N and 60 kg P20sl ha. For a balanced nutrition, 30 to 60 kg ~O is  included in fertilizer package of brinjal in most of the</p>
				<p>states.  1/3 N, full P and full K should be applied as basal dose and remaining N in 2  split doses, 1/3 at 25 days after planting and remaining 1/3 N 45 days after.<br />
Application  of fertilizers in Tamil Nadu :  Apply FYM  25 t/ha.  N 50 kg, P 50 kg and K 30 kg/ha  as basal dose, N 50 kg/ha 30 days after transplanting during earthing up.  Apply 2 kg of Azospirillum and  Phosphobacteria in the mainfield at planting.   Spray 2 ppm (1 ml in 500 lit.)   Triacontanol plus Sodium borate or Borax 35 mg/lit. of water 15 days  after transplanting and at the time of full bloom to increase the yield.<br />
<strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
Though  brinjal cannot tolerate water logging, timely irrigation is essential especially  for fruit set and development. In plains, irrigation is required at every third  or 4th day during summer while in winter it should be at 10-15 days interval.  During winter, care should be taken to keep soil moist to avoid crop loss due  to frost injury. Being a row planted crop, drip irrigation is advantageous and  water used in drip irrigation is only 24.47 cm compared to 69.18 cm under  furrow method. <br />
Brinjal  is mainly grown as a rainfed crop in high rainfall states like Kerala by  transplanting seedlings just before onset of South West monsoon. Here also  transplanted seedlings should be given one or two life irrigations for initial  establishment. <br />
<strong>Intercultivation</strong><br />
It  is essential to keep the field free of weeds especially at initial stages of  crop growth and is usually done by 2-3 light hoeing or earthing up. This  facilitates better aeration to root system and gives support to plants.  Application of fluchloralin @ 1.5 kg a.i./ha as a pre-emergent weedicide,  applied one week after transplanting seedlings, followed by one hand weeding at  30 days after planting controls a broad spectrum of weeds. Use of black  polythene mulches is also efficient for suppression of weeds and for better  growth of plants.<br />
<strong>Application of growth regulators </strong><br />
Whole  plant spray of 2-4, D (2 ppm) at an interval of one week from 60 -­70 days  after planting from commencement of flowering increase fruit set, early yield  and total yield in brinjal. Spray Mixtalool (long chain C24-C34 aliphatic  alcohol) at 4 ppm, 4-6 weeks after transplanting, is also effective and gave  additional yield of 7.1% in F1 hybrid Arka Navneet.<br />
<strong>Harvesting </strong><br />
Brinjal  fruits are harvested at immature stage after attaining full size, but before  loosing its glossy appearance. Dullness of fruit indicates over maturity. Usually  fruits are harvested along with its stalk with a slight twist by hand. In some  varieties, a sharp knife is also used for harvesting fruits along with fleshy  calyx and a portion of fruit stalk. The harvested fruits are graded and packed  in baskets or in loose gunny bags. Care should be taken to remove the fruits  affected by Phomopsis blight. <br />
<strong>Yield </strong><br />
Early  short duration varieties: 20-30 t/ha<br />
            Long  duration varieties: 35-40 t/ha<br />
FI  hybrids: 55-80 t/ha <br />
<strong>Storage </strong><br />
Fruits  can be stored for 7-10 days in a fairly good condition at 7.2-10°C with 85-90%  RH. Keeping quality of fruits varies with variety. It is better to store at  20°C than at 6°C and in perforated polythene bags than under open condition. <br />
<strong>Seed production </strong><br />
Though  brinjal is considered a self pollinated crop, varying amount of cross  pollination takes place because of heterostyly. Cross pollination is mainly  through honey bees and bumble bees. To encourage pollination, it is advisable  to plant Mimosa pudica in the vicinity of brinjal plot. Isolation distance  recommended for brinjal is 200 m for foundation seed and 100 m for certified  seed. <br />
To  maintain genetic purity, rouging should be conducted at pre flowering,  flowering and initial fruiting stages. Leaving initial one or two harvests for  vegetable purpose is advisable for detection and removal of off types and to  avoid chances of contamination from off types. <br />
Fruits  are harvested at full ripe stage and crushed with help of a wooden hammer or  stone. Crushed fruits are soaked overnight in buckets for softening. This  results in easy separation of seeds from pulp when pulp is stirred next day  morning. Seeds are then washed with running water and dried under open sun  light for half to one hour and later under partial shade till 8% moisture is  reached.  Depending on variety used and  agronomic packages followed, yield varies from 100-350 kg/ha. <br />
<strong>Pests</strong><br />
Pests  Fruit and shoot borer, jassids ,epilachna beetle and mites are the major pests. <br />

				  Adults and nymphs suck sap by  feeding from under surface of leave resulting in typical yellowing and drying  up of leaves. Varieties . Punjab Barsati and Pusa Kranti have tolerance to  jassid attack.<br />
  <strong>Epilachna beetle</strong><br />
				  Yellow  coloured nymphs seen on under surface leaves feed on foliage resulting in  skeletonization of leaves. Since nymph are seen in large numbers on a single  leaf plucking infested leaves along with nymph   is an effective way control of pest. <br />
				  Five  sprays of cipermethrin @ 30 g a.i./ha or ethofenprox @ 75 g a.i/ at 15 days  interval starting from 30 DAT is effecti.ve for control of jassi and fruit and  shoot borer. Four sprays of carbaryl (800 g a.i/ha) at days interval starting  from 30 DAT is also equally effective for control· pest.<br />
  <strong>Mites</strong><br />
				  Red  spider mites and other mites seen on under surface of leaf suck sap and cause  characteristic yellowing. Spray of neem oil garlic solution in initial stage of  attack is effective for control of mites. Under severe infestation spray  Kelthane (0.03%) or metasystox (0.03%).<br />
  <strong>Diseases</strong><br />
				  Diseases  Bacterial wilt Fusarian wilt, phomopsis blight, little leaf, mosaic and damping  off are the major diseases.<br />
  <strong>Bacterial wilt (Ralstonia  solanacearum) </strong><br />
				  Disease  results in sudden wilting and drying up of plants. Plants are more affected  during flowering and early fruiting stages. Grow resistant varieties like  Swetha, Haritha, Arka Nidhi, Arka Neelkant, Pant Samrat, Utkal Tarini, Utkal  Madhuri and F1 hybrid Neelima in wilt prone areas. <br />
  <strong>Fungal wilt</strong><br />
				  Fungi  like <em>Fusarium</em> and <em>Verticillium</em> cause wilting of plants.  Lower leaves turn yellow and progress slowly leading to  browning and complete death of plants. <em>Pythium</em> and <em>Phytophthora</em> also cause collar rot and wilting of plants. Crop  rotation burning with dry leaves prior to planting and drenching  the soil with copper oxychloride are  effective for control of wilt. <br />
  <strong>Phomopsis blight</strong><br />
				  This  is a major disease particularly when crop is raised for seed production. Soft  and water soaked brown lesions of fruits which turn black and mummified in  appearance are the common symptoms. Leaves and stem may also develop dark brown  sports. Seed treatment with Bavistin (l g a.i./kg) and seedling dip in Bavistin  (0.05%) for 30 minutes before transplanting, followed by two sprays of Bavistin  are recommended for control of disease. <br />

				<p><br />
				  Diseased  plants produce small sized leaves and result in bushy and stunted growth and  will not produce fruits. <br />
  <strong>Mosaic</strong><br />
				  Uproot  and destroy mosaic and little leaf affected plants as soon as symptoms are  noticed. Avoiding ratooning and raising seedlings in seed beds treated with  Phorate (1.25 kg a.i./ha), treating seedlings with systemic insecticides for  eight hours followed by application of Phorate (1.25 kg a.i./ha) at 21 DAT  control both little leaf and mosaic. <br />
  <strong>Damping off</strong><br />
				  This  is a major nursery disease. Affected seedlings topple over and die in patches.  For reducing disease incidence sow seeds as loose/ thin as possible on raised  beds. Adequate drainage are drenching nursery bed with Bavistin (0.1 %) control  disease effectively.<br />
