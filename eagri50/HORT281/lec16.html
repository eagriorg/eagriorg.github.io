			    <p>Garlic (Allium sativum) is one of the important bulb  crops grown and used as a spice or condiment throughout India. It is also  important foreign exchange earner for India. It is consumed by almost all  people who take onion. Garlic has higher nutritive value than other bulb crops.  It is rich in proteins, phosphorous, potassium, calcium, magnesium and  carbohydrates. Ascorbic acid content is very high in green garlic. </p>

				<p>            Healthy garlic bulbs contain allicin, colourless,  odourless and water-soluble amino acids. On crushing the garlic bulbs the  enzyme allinase breaks down into allin to produce allicin of which the  principal ingredient is odoriferous diallyl disulpide. Garlic contains about  0.1% volatile oil. The chief constituents of oil are diallyl disulfide (60% ),  diallyl trisulfide ( 20% ), allyl propyl disulfide ( 6% ), a small quantity of  diethyl disulfide and probably diallyle polysulfide. Diallyle disulfide  possesses the true garlic odour. Garlic has been cultivated for thousands of  years. It is the most ancient cultivated vegetables giving pungency of the  genus <em>Allium</em>. Original abode of garlic is said to be Central Asia and  Southern Europe especially Mediterranean region. Some authorities consider that <em>Allium longicuspis</em> Regael, which is endemic to Central Asia, is the wild  ancestor and spread in ancient times to Mediterrenean region. It is known in  Egypt in Predynastic times, before 3000BC and also to ancient Greeks and  Romans. It has long been grown in India and China. Garlic was carried to the  Western hemisphere by the Spanish, Pourtuguese and French. Garlic was not liked  by Romans due to strong odour. It was used in England as early as first half of  the 16th century. The early domestication of garlic took quite different turn  from that of seed propagated leek and onion. Garlic became exclusively  vegetatively propagated by cloves or bulbils. Some cultivars are reported to  produce flowers but there is no seed setting. Garlic cultivars differ in  maturity, bulb size, clove, clove size and number, scale colour, bolting and  flowering habits.<br />
                    <strong>Area, Production and  Productivity</strong> <br />
				  The production and productivity of garlic in India are  very low compared to many other countries. Unawareness of farmers about  improved varieties, climate, soil and agro-techniques, diseases and pest  damaging the crops and their control measures as well as post-harvest  management are though main reasons, inadequate market support is also  responsible for limiting the production and productivity indirectly.<br />
  <strong>VARIETIES</strong> <br />
				  Garlic  varieties, Agrifound White, Yamuna Safed, Yamuna Safed 2 and Yamuna Safed 3  have been notified by the Government of India. The varieties developed by NHRDF  are given below: <br />

<strong>MEDICINAL VALUE</strong> <br />
            Garlic is one of the important bulb crops grown and used  as a spice or a condiment throughout India. According to the Unani and  Ayurvedic systems as practised in India, garlic is carminative and is a gastric  stimulant and thus help in digestion and absorption of food. Allicin present in  aquous extract of garlic reduces cholesterol concentration in human blood. The  inhalation of garlic oil or garlic juice has generally been recommended by  doctors in case of pulmonary tuberculosis, rheumatism, sterility, impotency,  cough and red eyes. Garlic possesses insecticidal action. About 1% garlic  extract gives protection against mosquitoes for 8 hours. Extract of garlic  along with chilli and ginger has beneficial action against soil nematodes.  Beneficial use of garlic extract has been found against many fungi. <br />
<strong>AGRO TECHNIQUES </strong><br />
            Garlic is frost hardy plant requiring cool and moist  period during growth and relatively dry period during maturity of bulbs.  Bulbing takes place during longer days and at high temperature, exposure to low  temperature subsequent to bulb formation, favours the process. The critical day  length for bulbing of 12 hrs. along with, temperature also affects bulbing.  Exposures of dormant cloves or young plants to temperature of around 200C  or lower depending upon varieties for 1-2 months hasten subsequent bulbing.<br />
<strong>SOIL</strong> <br />
            Garlic can be grown on a variety of soils but it thrives  better on fertile, well-drained loam soils. The pH of soil between 6 and 7 is  suitable for good crop. Highly alkaline and saline soils are not suitable for  garlic cultivation. <br />
<strong>PLANTING</strong> </p>

                </table>
				<p><br />
                              The time of  planting differs from region-to-region. It is planted from August to October in  Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, and from September  to November in Northern plains of India. In Gujarat, planting is done during  October-November. Proper season for planting in higher hills in Northern part  is March-April. It can also be, however, planted during September-October. In  West Bengal and Orissa, October-November is best time for planting. <br />
				  Cloves of 8-10 mm diameter since give increased yield of  better quality, care should be taken to select bigger cloves from outer side of  bulbs. About 500 kg cloves of 8-10 mm diameter are required to plant one  hectare.</p>
				<p><strong>MANURES AND FERTILIZERS</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Garlic responds very  well to organic manures. For a normal soil 50 tonnes of farmyard manure, 100 kg  N, 50 kg P and 50 kg K/ha through chemical fertilizer has been recommended.  Micronutrients also increase its yield potential. <br />
                  <strong>IRRIGATION</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>In general, garlic needs  irrigation at 8 days intervals during vegetative growth and 10-15 days during maturation.  As the crop matures (when the tops first begin to break over or become dry),  stop irrigation to allow field to dry out first. Continued irrigation as the  crop matures causes the roots and bulb scales to rot. This discolour the bulbs  and exposes outer cloves and decreases the market value of bulbs. Irrigation  after long spell of drought results in splitting of bulbs. Excessive irrigation  results in sprouting. <br />
                  <strong>INTERCULTURE </strong> <br />
				  First weeding is done one month after planting and second  one month after first weeding. Hoeing the crop just before the formation of  bulbs (about two-and-a-half months after sowing) helps in setting of bigger  sized well filled bulbs. Pendimethalin @ 3.5 litres or Goal @ 0.25 kg/ha + 1  hand-weeding gives good control of broad leave weeds. <br />
                  <strong>HARVESTING AND CURING </strong> <br />
				  Garlic becomes ready for harvesting when its tops turn  yellowish or brownish and show signs of drying up and bend over. G 282 is  early-maturing cultivar. Harvesting at the stage when tops have fallen over  gives good quality bulbs. Bulbs are taken out along with tops and windrowed  gathering several rows in each row for curing. <br />
                  <strong>YIELD</strong><br />
				  The yields of bulbs vary from 100 to 200q/ha depending  upon variety and regions. <br />
                  <strong>SEED PRODUCTION </strong> <br />
				  Garlic is propagated by cloves. Well-grown compact bulbs  of uniform shape and size are selected. The cloves having 8-10 cm size are used  for planting. The planting method and other operations followed for production  of seed are the same as for bulbs production. <br />
                  <strong>POST- HARVEST MANAGEMENT</strong> <br />
			    Many operations are performed for getting mature and  quality bulbs from the field to the consumer. About 15-50% losses occur if  proper post-harvest management practices are not followed. These practices  differ from place-to-place. Proper curing, sorting and grading, transportation  and storage are essential to minimize these looses.</p>
				<p><strong>DRYING AND CURING</strong> <br />
            Drying and curing are very essential. Drying is done to  remove excess moisture from outer skin and neck to reduce storage rot, while  curing is an additional process of drying to remove the excess moisture and to  allow the colour development and help the bulbs to become compact and go into  dormant stage. It is done for about a week in the field for drying. The method  and period of curing vary depending on weather at the time of harvesting. Bulbs  are covered along with their tops to avoid damage to bulbs from sun. These are  also cured for 7-10 days in shade either with tops or after curing the tops by  leaving 2.5 cm above the bulbs and removing the roots. Harvesting at 100% neck  fall and curing by windrow method have been recommended. The curing in field  till foliage turns yellow should be done. Artificial curing can be done by  passing hot air at 27.35ºC through the curing room. It takes about 48 hours for  complete curing process if humidity is between 60 - 75%.<br />
<strong>SORTING AND GRADING</strong> <br />
            Garlic bulbs after curing are run over a grader or graded  manually before their storage or marketing. The thick- necked, splitted,  injured, and diseased or bulbs with hollow cloves are sorted out. Size grading  is done after sorting. It is very much necessary for getting better price and  to minimize losses on account of drying and decay. Government of India has  prescribed certain grade designations for different qualities of garlic for  export. The grade designations and definition of different qualities of garlic  have been prescribed. <br />
<strong>PACKAGING </strong> <br />
            In India, garlic bulbs are packed in open mesh jute bags  for domestic use. It is packed in bags of 90 and 40 kg capacity each in Andhra  Pradesh, Karnataka and other garlic, growing states respectively. As per the  garlic grading and packing rules, 18 and 25 kg packing are done in perforated  10 ply corrugated cardboard boxes for export. Nylon-netted bags used for  packing and further storage cause minimum losses in storage. In foreign  countries, plastic-wooven bags are very commonly used. These have good strength  and are also attractive. Since garlic needs less ventilation compared to onion,  there is a need to develop suitable packaging to reduce drying loss.<br />
<strong>STORAGE</strong> <br />
            Thoroughly cured garlic bulbs are stored well in ordinary  well-ventilated rooms. Garlic with dried leaves can be stored by hanging in  well-ventilated rooms. This is, however, not possible on commercial scale  because space requirement is more. Storage without tops in nylon-netted bags  give better performance at Nasik and Karnal as such the same has been  recommended for storage to minimize loss. In Jamangar area (Gujarat), some  pockets of Indore and Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh and Manipuri and Etah district  of Uttar Pradesh, bulbs are stored for 6-8 months. Since garlic stores well for  market under a wide range of temperature, controlled conditioned (low  temperature) storage are not necessary. Cloves sprout quickly at 4.4ºC and  prolonged storage in this temperature range should be avoided. Storage at 0.5ºC  is satisfactory, but high humidities often accompany low temperature storage.  Garlic stored at humidity higher than 70% at any temperature develop mould and  start rotting. Cold storage of garlic is possible at 32-36ºF and 60-70%  relative humidity. The storage loss of 12.5% is recorded in garlic stored at  1-5ºC and 75% relative humidity compared to 42.4% losses in ambient  temperature. UV light treatment for 30 minutes further reduces loss to 8% in cold  stores for 150 days storage.<br />
            Irradiation with 2-6 krad of cobalt 60 gamma rays have  also been recommended for controlling sprouting in storage. The irradiation  given to bulbs within 8 weeks of harvesting (before sprout initiation) can  inhibit sprouting effectively, reduce weight loss and can prolong storage life  for about one year. Doses higher than 10 Kr reduce diallyl disulfide content  which gives typical garlic flavour. Storage life of garlic is prolonged and  loss in eight is also reduced by spraying 3000 ppm MH 3 weeks before  harvesting. Yamuna Safed (G 1), Yamuna Safed-2 (G 50) and G 323 are better  storer. Pre-harvest spraying of 0.1% carbendazim and disinfection of premises  for handling and storage of garlic also reduce post-harvest losses particularly  decay loss. Phosphorus and potassium application reduce weight loss in garlic  storage while nitrogen application increases it.<br />
<strong>PLANT PROTECTION </strong><br />
            Garlic is attacked by many diseases and insects pests.  Therefore garlic growers need to know the details of symptoms of diseases and  insect pests attacking garlic and their control measures for getting healthy  crop. Diseases and insects pests, and their control measures attacking garlic  crop are described as under:<br />
<strong>DISEASES </strong><br />
<strong>PURPLE BLOTCH </strong> <br />
            Purple blotch (<em>Alternaria porri</em>) appears on leaves  as small whitish sunken lesions with purple centres that rapidly enlarge. The  leaves fall over gradually. Spraying of Mancozeb @ 2.5 g/litre of water at 15  days intervals gives good control.<br />
<strong>STEMPHYLIUM BLIGHT </strong> <br />
            Stemphylium blight (<em>Stemphylium vesicarium</em>)  appears as small, yellow to orange flecks or streaks on leaf. These soon  develop into elongated, spindle-shaped to ovate elongate, diffused spots, often  reaching the leaf tips. They usually turn gray at the centre, brown to dark  olive brown with the development of conidiophores and conidia of the pathogen.  The spots frequently coalesce into extended patches blightening the leaves and  gradually the entire foliage.<strong></strong><br />
<strong>CERCOSPORA LEAF BLIGHT</strong> <br />
            Caused by <em>Cercospora duddiae</em>, this disease appears  on leaves as small, ash-coloured and irregular shaped spots scattered on leaf  lamina. The spots coalesce gradually and results in blightening of foliage.  Spraying of ziram or captan @ 2.0 g/litre of water or copper oxychloride @ 3.0  g /litre of water at fortnightly intervals gives good control.<br />
<strong>POWDERY MILDEW</strong> <br />
            Powdery mildew is caused by <em>Leveillula taurica</em>.  Distinct pale-yellow patches of variable size on abaxial surface of leaf  associated with powdery mass are its main characteristics. Sulphur fungicides @  2.0 g/ litre of water if sprayed at regular intervals of 15 days after disease  appearance gives good control.<br />
<strong>MOSAIC DISEASE</strong> <br />
            Garlic plants infected with mosaic virus show typical  symptoms of chlorotic mottling and strips on first emerging leaf followed by  pale-yellow broken stripes, resulting in typical mosaic pattern on matured  leaves. Yellowish dots on leaves, whitish leaf margin or twisting of leaves are  also recorded on a few cultivars. Generally symptoms are mild on younger leaves  than on matured leaves. Bulbs harvested from mosaic affected plants after  maturity remains smaller in size and cloves are fewer in number. Since virus is  transmitted through aphids, spraying of monocrotophos @ 0.5 ml/litre of water  or methyl demeton @ 0.75 ml/litre of water is useful.<br />
<strong>INSECT PESTS </strong> <br />
<strong>THRIPS </strong> <br />
            Thrips (<em>Thrips tabaci</em>) are perhaps the most  important insect pests attacking garlic. They are most common during warm  weather. They feed on leaf surfaces, causing them to whiten or silver. They are  slender about 1/25&quot; long usually hide in angles of leaves. Spraying of  Malathion @ 1 ml/ litre or methyldemeton @ 0.75 ml/ litre of water gives good  control if sprayed at frequent intervals. Four sprays of fluvalinate (0.04%) at  fortnightly interval at Karnal and malathion (0.1%) at Nasik gave best  performance in controlling thrips. Phorate @ 1 kg ai/ha at planting and 30 days  after planting controls thrips effectively. <br />
<strong>STEM AND BULB NEMATODE </strong> <br />
            Caused by <em>Ditylenchus dipsaci</em>, it is a tiny worm  almost invisible to the naked eye which invades the tissues of garlic, and can  seriously reduce the yield. The infestation causes the basal portion of mature  plants to swell and become spongy and frequently broken by longitudinal splits.  The tissue rots, the leaves and stems become rotten and twisted and the plant  is stunted. In severely infested plants, basal plants may be so rotted that it  pulls away when the plant is lifted, leaving the roots in the ground. The  nematodes are, however, not common in garlic in India. <br />
Pre-planting soil  fumigation with dichloro-propene-dichloropropane mixture @ 500 kg/ha is  recommended. Ethylene dibromide and dibromochloropropane (Nemagon) should not  be used as these leave residues in soil. <br />
<strong>MITES </strong> <br />
            The eriophyid mite, <em>Aceria tulipae</em>, a common pest  of garlic is so small that its infestations are frequently over-looked. Young  garlic plants injured by mites usually have destroyed and twisted leaves with  conspicuous yellow or light green streaking. The leaves may not emerge readily  from the cloves and leaf blades separate poorly after emergence. Bulbs stored  for long period may be severely attacked by mites. The cloves wither and bulbs  lose their firmness. <br />
<strong>RHIZOGLYPHUS CALLAE AND  GLYCOHAQUS DOMESTICUS</strong> <br />
            These may attack on bulbs in storage. Fumigation of dry  bulbs with methyl bromide after harvesting and before storage controls the  mites. Application of methyl bromide @ 1kg/1000 cubic feet for 2 hours at 26ºC  is recommended. <br />
<strong>PHYSIOLOGICAL DISORDERS</strong> <br />
            Sprouting of bulbs in the field is noticed sometimes  towards the start of maturity stage of bulbs particularly when there are winter  rains or excessive soil moisture and nitrogen supply. This disorder is,  however, not of permanent nature and varies from variety-to-variety.  Early-planting also causes sprouting. Splitting is also noticed sometimes in  some varieties, which is due to delayed harvesting or irrigation after long  spell of drought. For past few years rubberification problem is noticed in  Rajkot area and also Nilgiri hills of Tamil Nadu. It is increasing day-by-day.  The actual cause for the disorder was since not identified, a trial was planned  in collaboration with TNAU at HRS, Ooty, during 1995-96. The effects of  insecticides, fungicides, micronutrients and growth regulator were studied. It  was observed that rubberification was totally controlled by application of  micronutrients i.e. zinc sulphate and ammonium molybdate. It was also  controlled by neem cake insecticides and growth regulator like GA. <br />
            Further studies are required to eliminate this problem in  different areas as the incidence is noticed variably in different areas.<br />
            The aerial bulbil formation is also quite common in  garlic where lower temperature prevails for more periods or there is more  temperature variation. It, however, does not affect much on yield or quality of  bulbs and varietal variation is noticed where G-282 is seen more prone for this  type of effect.<br />
            The rubberification and premature sprouting of bulbs are  main physiological disorders in garlic. The reasons for these disorders are  summarized as under for hill grown garlic in Tamil Nadu.</p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Rubberification and premature sprouting of bulbs are       noticed mostly in fields which are located in low-lying areas of watershed       where there is heavy deposition of nutrients along with silt during heavy       rains. </li>
			    </ul>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>These problems are severe in garlic fields which are       more frequently irrigated than the normal requirements of garlic bulbs. </li>
			    </ul>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>With the application of higher levels of nitrogen,       there is an increased level of pre-mature sprouting of bulbs which results       in splitting and rubberification of bulbs. </li>
			    </ul>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Rubberification incidence also increases when higher       level of nitrogen is applied in the form of urea. </li>
			    </ul>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Due to increased levels of nitrogen, in addition to the       increased production of rubberized, there is an increased level of thrips       incidence in leaves during the later stage of crop. The thrips lacerate       leaves and cause severe damage to the crop. Through lacerated wounds by       thrips, there is a severe incidence of blast disease, caused by <em>Botrytis       allii, </em>when crops is 70-90 days old, which further deteriorates the       quality of garlic bulbs. </li>
			    </ul>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Short duration type of garlic (Mettupalayam type) is       more susceptible than long duration type (Singapore type). </li>
			    </ul>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Premature sprouting of bulbs is more in the crop (April-August)       when there is high moisture level in soil at maturity of crop due to heavy       rains. </li>
			    </ul>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Delayed harvest during rainy season has increased       premature sprouting and splitting of bulbs. </li>
			    </ul>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Wider spacing of cloves at the time of planting       increases uptake of nitrogen and water by the individual plants which       increases premature sprouting and rubberification of garlic bulbs. </li>
