				<p><strong>Climate and soil</strong><br />
				  Cool and moist  climate is most favourable for growing turnip. However, it can also be grown  where summers are mild. The roots develop best flavour, texture, and size at a  temperature of 10°–15°C. The short day length and cool weather favour proper  development of roots. The long day and high temperature induce early bolting  even without adequate development of roots. In hot weather, roots become  fibrous, tough and more pungent. The Asiatic types can tolerate high  temperature, while temperate types are quick-growing and flourish well under  cool weather.<br />
				  Turnip can be  grown in all kinds of soils but it grows well in loam soil having sufficient  humus. The well-drained, sandy loam soil is ideal for its cultivation. The  extremely light sandy soil or too heavy soils should be avoided. In such soils  either the plant growth is hampered or forked or defective roots are formed  which are unfit for market.<br />
                  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
				  Turnip varieties are divided  into 2 groups- Asiatic or tropical types and European or temperate. These can  further be classified on the basis of root shape as well as skin and flesh  colour. The varieties recommended for cultivation are:<br />
                  <strong>Early Milan Red Top</strong><br />
				  Its roots are  deep flat with purplish red top and white underneath. The flesh is pure white,  well grained, crisp and mildly pungent. The top is very small with 4–6 sessile  leaves. It is an extra early and very high yielding variety.<br />
                  <strong>Golden Ball</strong><br />
				  Its roots are  perfectly globe shaped, medium sized and smooth. It has bright, creamy yellow  skin and pale amber coloured flesh of fine texture and flavour. The top is  small, erect with cut leaves.<br />
                  <strong>Punjab Safed 4</strong><br />
				  An early  maturing variety, commonly grown in Punjab and Haryana. The roots are pure  white, round, medium-sized with mild taste.<br />
                  <img border="0" width="214" height="211" src="lec29_clip_image010.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="Purple Top White Globe Turnip" title="" /><strong>Purple Top White Globe</strong><br />
				  It is a heavy-yielder and large-rooted  variety. The roots are nearly round, upper part purplish, lower portion is  creamy. The flesh is white, firm, crisp and mildly sweet flavoured. Top is  small, erect with cut leaves. It is suitable for growing during cooler months.<br />
                  <strong>Pusa Chandrima</strong><br />
				  Its roots are  medium to large, nearly flattened globe to globular, smooth, pure white skin  with fine grains. The flesh is sweet and tender. Top medium and leaves not so deeply  cut. It is an early maturing (50–60 days), heavy cropper with an average yield  of 400q/ha. It is suitable for sowing from October to December in plains.<br />
                  <strong>Pusa Kanchan</strong></p>
				It is a selection from the cross of Asiatic  (Local Red Round) and European (Golden Ball) varieties. It contains good  qualities of both the parents. The roots look just like the Local Red Round.  The skin is red, flesh is creamy yellow with excellent flavour and taste. The  leaf top is shorter than the Local Red Round. It becomes ready for harvesting  in about 10 days later than
				<p>the local parent. Its roots can be kept for a longer time than  Local Red Round in field without becoming spongy.<br />
                    <strong>Pusa Swarnima</strong><br />
				  The roots are  flattish round with creamy-yellow skin and pale amber coloured flesh of fine  texture and flavour. Its top is medium; leaf blade is not so deeply cut. It is  suitable for growing from June to October in hills and October to December in  plains. It matures in 65–70 days.<br />
  <strong>Pusa Sweti</strong><br />
				  Attractive,  white roots of Pusa Sweti mature 45–50 days after sowing. A very early maturing  variety, it is suited for October sowing in plains.<br />
  <strong>Snow Ball</strong> <br />
				  This variety  is an early temperate type with medium sized small top. Its leaves are erect,  cut and medium green. The roots are round, smooth with pure white skin. The  flesh is white, fine grained, sweet and tender.<br />
  <strong>Cultivation</strong><br />
				  The method of  land preparation for turnip is the same as for radish. Asiatic turnips are sown  from July to September, whereas European types from October–December in  northern plains of India. In hills, sowing time is usually from July–September.  Its seeds are sown directly either in lines or on ridges. Normally, flat beds  are used for sowing turnip but sowing in low lying area or during the rainy  season should be done on ridges. Seeds are sown on ridges or rows 30cm apart  while a spacing of 5–7cm is kept within the row. The seeds are sown 1.5cm deep.  Seeds can be mixed with sand or ash to facilitate uniform sowing. Generally  thinning is done 10–15 days after germination. The plants are spaced 10–15cm  apart within rows. Bold seeds germinate better than the medium ones. About  90–95% seeds germinate. Seeds remain viable for 4–5 years under good storage  conditions. Seeds take 4–6 days to germinate.<br />
  <strong>Manuring and  fertilization</strong> <br />
				  The quantity  of manures and fertilizers to be applied depends upon climate, fertility  status, pH level and texture of the soil. The proper time of application is  equally important to facilitate optimum intake of plant nutrients for good  harvest. Different doses of NPK have been recommended for various agroclimatic  zones of India. However, a basal dose of 20–25 tonnes/ha of farmyard manure  should be applied at the time of land preparation. This is supplemented by  applying 70–100kg of N and 50kg/ha each of P and K. The complete dose of P, K  and half of N should by applied before sowing. Phosphatic and potassic  fertilizers are applied 7–8cm deep before sowing. The remaining half of N is  given in 2 split doses: first at the time of root formation and the second during  development of root knobs.<br />
				  Micronutrient  requirement is almost similar to that of radish. Intake of B, Ca and Mo is more  in turnip. Therefore, deficiency of these micronutrients is overcome by  spraying 1kg/ha of Micnelf MS-24 one or two times depending upon the  requirement. It helps to control hollow-stem, pith formation and brown heart in  turnip.<br />
  <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
				  Irrigation  requirement of turnip is similar to that of radish. This is generally irrigated  at 8–15 days interval depending upon weather conditions. The increase in  moisture stress drastically affects its yield. Therefore, optimum required  moisture is maintained by irrigating the crop at proper time.<br />
  <strong>Interculture</strong><br />
				  About 2–3  hoeings are done to keep the crop weed-free and to conserve moisture. The earthing-up  is done during second and third hoeings after top dressing of nitrogenous  fertilizers to produce better quality roots. Usually 2–3 weedings are done till  the crop is harvested. However, at the latter stage of crop growth, the fully  developed leaves also restrict the weeds. The pre-emergence application of  herbicide, Tok E-25 (Nitrofen) @ 2kg/ha effectively controls the weeds.<br />
  <strong>Seed production</strong><br />
				  The method of  raising seed crop as well as the techniques of seed production is the same as  for radish. The Asiatic turnips produce seed in plains, whereas European ones  in hills only. The selected roots are used to prepare the stecklings by pruning  the root tip from the base and leave one-third of crown after trimming off the  top. These stecklings are transplanted 60cm × 60cm apart in the hills and 45cm  × 35cm apart in the plains. An isolation distance of 1,000–1,600m should be  kept from Chinese cabbage, mustard and other turnips to avoid contamination by  crossing with these crops. Application of 84kg of N, 50kg/ha each of P and K  results into good seed yield in turnip. When 70% of the pods turn light yellow,  they should be harvested immediately to avoid shattering and damage by birds.  On an average, seed yield of 5–6q/ha is obtained.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting and  postharvest management</strong><br />
				  The fully  developed tender roots of turnip are uprooted on attaining the marketable size.  Normally the roots are harvested when they are 5–10cm in diameter depending  upon the variety. The roots become tough and fibrous if harvesting is delayed.  The harvesting should be done in the evening. The yield of turnip varies with  varieties as well as growing season. On an average it yields 200–400q/ha.<br />
  <img width="270" height="199" src="lec29_clip_image002_0000.jpg" align="left" hspace="9" vspace="6" alt="Turnips" />             Its harvested  roots along with the green tops are properly washed to remove the adhered soil.  The side roots are trimmed off. These are sent to the market in baskets either  along with green tops or after cutting them off near the surface of the crown.  After removing old and diseased leaves the foliage is made into bunches for  marketing. The roots are sorted into different grades according to colour,  shape and size to give an attractive appearance in the market. Then these are  immediately transported to the market and disposed off. The roots can be stored  safely for 2–3 days under cool and moist conditions. However, it can be stored  for 8–16 weeks at 00C with 90–95% relative humidity.<br />
  <strong>Physiological disorder</strong> <br />
				  Whip tail is  caused due to deficiency of Mo. This is more common in acidic soils. Young  leaves become narrow, cupped, showing chlorotic mottling especially around the  margin, develop deep patches which ultimately affect the root growth. The  affected plants are removed from the field during thinning. Further appearance  of this disorder can be controlled by liming the soil and bringing the pH to  6.5. However, it is controlled by the application of 1.2kg/ha of sodium or  ammonium molybdate.<br />
