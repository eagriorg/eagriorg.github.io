                    <strong>(Syn: Elephant foot yam) <em>Amorphophallus paeoniifolius</em></strong><br />
                    <strong>(Syn: <em>A. campanulatus </em>(Roxb.) Blume) (2n = 28)</strong><br />
				  (Hindi: <em>Suran, Zamikand</em>) Family: Araceae<br />
			    <p>Elephant foot yam is a remunerative  and profitable stem tuber crop.  The crop  is gaining popularity due to its shade tolerance, easiness in cultivation, high  productivity, less incidence of pests and diseases, steady demand and  reasonably good price.  Tubers are mainly  used as vegetable after thorough cooking.   Chips are made of starch-rich tubers.   Tender stem and leaves are also used for vegetable purpose.  Tubers contain 18.0% starch, 1-5% protein and  upto 2% fat.  Leaves contain 2-3%  protein, 3% carbohydrates and 4-7% crude fibre.   Tubers and leaves are quite acrid due to high content of oxalates.  Acridity is usually removed by boiling fairly  for a long time.  Cultivation of elephant  foot yam is limited to India, Philippines, Sri Lanka and South East Asia.<br />
				  Unlike other tubers, <em>Amorphophallus </em>roots have many medicinal  uses and are widely prescribed by Ayurvedic physicians.  <em>Amorphophallus </em>corm is a good source of phyto-aestrogens and is effective alternate of  complementary to conventional hormone replacement thereby for symptoms associated  with menopause and chronic degenerative diseases in women.<br />
  <strong>Botany</strong><br />
				  Cultivated species <em>A. paeonifolius </em>is a robust herbaceous  plant 1.0 – 1.5 m tall.  Large dissected  tripartite leaves constitute the luxuriant outspreading crown-like foliage,  borne on a fairly thick single upright “stem”.   The aerial “pseudostem” which is round with characteristic irregular  blotches is botanically a leaf petiole.<br />
				  Though crop is perennial due to  underground stem, it is treated as an annual with duration of 8-9 months.  It is usually harvested when top becomes  yellow and withers (8-9 months after planting).   It flowers once in 1-3 years.   Inflorescence consists of a bell-shaped spathe surrounding a central  yellow spadix and is borne on a very short stalk.  It appears almost at ground level.  Although wild species flower and set seeds  profusely, cultivated species fall to set seeds under normal condition due to  extreme protogyny coupled with delay in opening of spathe.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

                    <strong>Climate and soil</strong><br />
                </p>
	      <em>            <p>Amorphophallus is a tropical /  subtropical crop and hence thrives well under warm humid climate with a mean  annual temperature of 30-35oC and a well distributed rain of  1000-1500 mm spread over a period of 6-8 months.  It grows well on a variety of soils.  Well drained sandy loam or sandy clay loam  with near neutral soil reaction is ideal for the crop.  Soil should be rich in organic matter with  adequate amount of available plant nutrients.<br />
                    <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
                    <strong>Sree Padma</strong>–  Developed at CTCRI, Thiruvannthapuram; yield 42 t/ha<br />
                    <strong>Gajendra</strong>–  Developed at APAU, Hyderabad.<br />
                    <strong>Propagation</strong><br />
                  <em>Amorphophallus </em>is propagated through corm.  Corms  harvested during November are stored in well ventilated rooms.  Before planting during February, the corm is  cut into setts of 750-100 g. each bearing a portion of central bud.  Cut corms are smeared with cow dung slurry or  wood ash and allowed to dry in partial shade.   Rapid seed corm production technique suggests use of cormels and mini  sett transplants of 100 g size for planting at a closer spacing of 45 x 30 cm.<br />
                  <strong>Cultivation practices</strong><br />
				  After one or two ploughings, pits of  size 60 x 60 x 45 cm are made at a spacing of 90 x 90 cm during February.  For harvesting small to medium sized tubers,  distance between pits is reduced to 60 x 60 cm.   Pits are half filled with top soil and well dried farmyard manure @  2.0-2.5 kg/pit and wood ash.  Planting  material is placed vertically in the pit.   After compacting the planted tubers, pits are covered with organic  mulches like green leaves or paddy straw.   Apply fertilizer @ 40 kg N, 60 kg P2O5 and 50 kg K2O  / ha 45 days after plating along with mulching and application of cow dung or  compost after receipt of rains.  This is  followed by digging interspaces and light earthing up.  Top dressing is done with 40 kg N, 50 kg K2O  again one month after, along with shallow intercultural operations like  weeding, light digging and earthing up.<br />
                  <em>            Amorphophallus </em>is mainly grown as a  rainfed crop. During periods of late receipt of monsoon, a light irrigation is  given during early stages of crop. Crop is susceptible to water stagnation.<br />
				  Mulching immediately after planting  is the most important operation in <em>Amorphophallus. </em>It not only conserves soil moisture and regulates soil temperature, but  also suppresses weed growth.<br />
				  A plant usually produces a single  “stem”.  In case of more numbers, it is  advisable to remove it retaining only one healthy one.<br />
                  <strong>Pests and diseases</strong><br />
				  <em>Amorphophallus </em>is free from major pests and diseases except collar rot caused by <em>Sclerotium rolfsii.</em>  Water logging, poor drainage and mechanical  injury at the collar region favour disease incidence.  Disease can be managed by use of disease-free  planting material, removal of infected plants, improving drainage, application  of neem cake in soil, use of bio-control agents like <em>Trichoderma </em>and drenching soil with captan 0.2%.<br />
                  <strong>Harvest and yield</strong><br />
				  Underground corms are harvested with  pick axe or by digging when the top is completely withered and fallen.  Crop will be ready for harvest in 8-9 months  after planting.  However on better market  price, tubers can be harvested six month onwards.  Average yield is 30 - 40 t/ha.<br />

				<p><strong>Botany</strong><br />
				  Yam tuber is neither a root  structure nor a stem, but may have its origin as a hypocotyls structure.  Tuber grows from a small corm structure  located at base of stem.  In all yams,  tubers are renewed annually.  Tubers may  be single or two or three. <em>D. esculenta </em>produces  a large number of small and spindle shaped tubers.  <em>D.  bulbfera </em>and <em>D.alata </em>produces a  large number of small and spindle shaped tubers.  <em>D.  bulbifera </em>and <em>D.alata</em> produce  aerial bulbs called bulbils from axils of leaves.  Whole tubers or pieces of tubers with stem  are used for planting in yams.  Bulbils  can also used for propagation.<br />
				  Stem is weak and climbs on trees by  twining.  In <em>D. rotundata </em>stem remains erect upto one metre height.  Leaves are simple.  All species are dioecious.  Fruits are dehiscent tri-locular capsules.  Seeds are small and dispersed by wind.  Even though all the species have seed  dormancy for three months, <em>D. alata </em>does  not exhibit seed dormancy.  In <em>D. alata, </em>majority of male clones are  tetraploids (2n = 40) and majority of females have higher ploidy level (2n=60  or 80).<br />
                  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
			    Improved varieties developed at  Central Tuber Crops Research Institute (CTCRI), Sreekaryam, Thiruvananthapuram  in Kerala are given below:</p>
		    <p align="left"><strong>Greater yam</strong><br />
                    <strong><em>(Dioscorea  alata) </em></strong><br />
                    <em>(Hindi: Ratula) (2n = 20, 30, 40-80)</em> <br />
                    <strong>Sree Keerthi:</strong>Tubers  are conical with brown skin and white flesh having 20-22% starch.  It yields 25-30 t/ha in 9-10 months.<br />
                    <strong>Sree Roopa:</strong>Tubers  are digitate in shape with black skin and white flesh.  Productivity is 25-30 t/ha in 9-10 months.<br />
                    <strong>Sree Shilpa: </strong> Tubers are swollen, oval and smooth with black  skin and white flesh.  Yield is 28 t/ha  in 8 months.<br />
                    <strong>Indu:</strong> Indu is a high yielding (39.39 t/ha)  variety developed by Kerala Agricultural University.  Tubers are digitate with brownish black skin  and white to pale flesh.<br />
                    <strong>White yam (<em>D. rotundata</em>)</strong><br />
                    <strong>Sree Subhna:</strong>   Tubers are cylindrical with brown and partially hairy skin and white  flesh.  Yield is 35-40 t/ha in 9-10  months.<br />
                    <strong>Sree Priya:</strong> It produces 2-3 tubers having smooth surface  and good cooking quality.  Yield is 35-40  t/ha in 9-10 months.<br />
                    <strong>Sree Dhanya:</strong>This  is a dwarf and bush variety with spineless stem and tubers containing 23.3%  starch.<br />
                    <strong>Propagation and time of planting</strong><br />
				  In greater yam and white yam, tuber  pieces of 250-300 g size are used as planting material.  For this, tubers are cut longitudinally with  a portion of stem end and allowed to dry under partial shade after dipping in  cow dung slurry.  Planting is usually  done during March-April.<br />
				  Plough / dig land to a depth of  15-20 cm.  Take pits of 45 cm3  at a distance of      1 m.  Apply 1½ kg compost or well rotten cattle  manure in the pit and full up to ¾ with top soil.  Plant tubers and mulch with dry leaves.  Approximately 1800-2700 kg seed material is  required to plant one hectare.<br />
  <strong>Manuring</strong><br />
				  Apply cattle manure or compost @ 10  t/ha as basal dressing before planting.   A fertilizer dose of 80 kg N, 60 kg P2O5 and 80 kg  K2O per hectare in two split doses is needed for yams.  Half dose of N, full dose of phosphorus and  half dose of potash are to be applied within a week after sprouting.  Remaining nitrogen and potash may be applied  one month after the first application.   Top dressing of fertilizers should be followed by weeding and earthing  up.<br />
  <strong>Interculture</strong><br />
				  Vines are allowed to trail on shrubs  or trees or props for high productivity.   Tubers are harvested in 9-10 months when leaves turn yellow in  colour.  Harvesting is done by digging  surrounding, area and exposing tubers.</p>
				<p align="left"><strong>Lesser  Yam (<em>D. esculenta</em>) (2n = 40, 60, 90,  100)</strong><br />
				  Hindi:  (Suthni)<br />
  <strong>Sree Latha:</strong> Tubers are oblong to fusiform in shape with  creamy white flesh and greyish brown skin covered with thin hairs.  It yields 20-25 t/ha in 8-9 months.  Tubers have 18.4% starch content.<br />
  <strong>Sree  Kala:</strong> Tuber is sweet,  round and smooth.  Yield is 20-25 t/ha in  8-9 months.<br />
				  Cultivation of lesser yam is  different from that of greater yam or white yam.  Plough / dig the land thoroughly and make  small mounds at a distance of 70 cm after incorporating compost or well rotten  cow dung. Plant whole tubers of 100-150 g. Manuring and other cultivation  practices are similar to that of greater yam.   Trailing is necessary to expose leaves to sunlight.  It is done within 15 days after sprouting by  coir rope attached to artificial supports in open area.  Lesser yam is harvested in 8-9 months after  planting.  Harvesting is done by digging  out tubers carefully.<br />
				  Scale insect is a serious pest of  yam and is usually controlled by dipping planting material in monocrotophos  (0.05%).<br />
