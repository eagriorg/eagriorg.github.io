				<p align="center"><strong>Origin, area,  production, varieties, package of practices for RADISH</strong><br />
                    <strong> (<em>Raphanus  sativus </em>L.) (2n = 2x = 18)</strong><br />
				  (Hindi:  Mooli) Family: Brassicaceae<br />
			    <p align="center">Radish is grown for its tender  tuberous roots which are eaten raw as salad or as cooked vegetable.  It has a unique pungent flavour.  It is also used in <em>Parathas </em>which are taken with curd for breakfast in north India. It  has a cooling effect, prevents constipation and increases appetite and is more  nutritious when cooked with leaves.   Young leaves are also cooked as vegetable.  It is recommended for patients suffering from  piles, liver troubles, jaundice etc.   Juice of fresh leaves is sued as diuretic and laxative.  Radish is a good source of vitamin-C and  minerals.<br />
				  Rat-tail radish (<em>R. sativus </em>var. <em>caudatus</em>), which is similar to common radish, is grown for its long  slender pods which are used as salad or cooked vegetable.  It will not produce fleshy root as in radish.<br />
  <img border="0" width="150" height="240" src="lec28_clip_image002.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /><img width="155" height="229" src="lec28_clip_image004.gif" align="left" hspace="12" /><strong>Origin</strong><br />
				  Radish is originated in Europe and  Asia.  It is believed to have originated  from <em>Raphanus raphanistrum, </em>which is  widely distributed as a weed crop in Europe.<br />
                  <strong>Botany</strong><br />
				  Radish is an annual or biennial  depending on the ecotype / cultivar.  The  rosette leaves are lyrate, pinnatifid and vary in size from 10 cm to 15 cm in  small rooted cultivars to 45 cm in large rooted cultivars.  Edible portion develops from both the primary  root and hypocotyls.  Inflorescence is of  racemose type with white flowers.  Fruit  is a siliqua.  Seeds are yellowish when  mature and turn reddish brown with age.   Radish is cross-pollinated due to sporophytic self incompatibility.  Pollination is by honey bees and flies.  Stigma receptivity is maintained up to 4 days  after anthesis.  Selfing is by bud  pollination.  Flower buds are pollinated  two days prior to opening of flower by collecting pollen grains of previously  bagged flowers of the same plant.<br />

				<p align="center"><img width="125" height="178" src="lec28_clip_image008.gif" align="left" hspace="12" /><img src="lec28_clip_image010.gif" width="521" height="173" align="middle" /><br />
                  <img width="353" height="179" src="lec28_clip_image012.gif" /></p>
				<p><strong>Varieties</strong><br />
				  Radish varieties vary in shape,  sized and skin colour of roots and duration of cop.  The varieties can be divided into three  groups – European or temperate types.   Asiatic or tropical types and Indian types.  Temperate types are of small size, with  excellent quality and mainly used for salad purpose.  Tropical types are more pungent than  temperate types and have large roots.  An  indigenous type, Jaunpuri Giant, cultivated Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh, has roots  of 75-90 cm length, 50-60 cm girth and weight up to 5-15 kg.<br />

				<p><strong>Climate </strong><br />
            Ideal temperature for growth and  development of quality roots in radish is 10-15.5oC.  Though it can tolerate high temperature,  roots develop pungency under hot weather.   Hence, it should be harvested when roots are small and tender during hot  periods.<br />
<strong>Soil</strong><br />
            Being a root crop, radish requires  loose and friable soil, rich in organic matter.<br />
<strong>Land preparation and sowing</strong><br />
            In plains of North India, radish can  be grown throughout the year.  Since  temperate radish tolerates frost, it is successfully grown between September  and January in plains.  Tropical types  are sown from middle of September onwards.   If sowing is done later than November, it bolts earlier.<br />
            Land is ploughed to a fine tilth and  ridges of 25 cm height and furrows are prepared at 30-45 cm distance.  Seeds are sown continuously in ridges.  Spacing depends on type of varieties.  Indian tropical cultivars take longer time  and grow larger.  Distance between two  rows is kept at 45 cm and seeds are sown continuously on ridges.  Later they are thinned to keep a distance of  6-8 cm in a row.  European types will be  ready in 25-30 days and are sown at a closer spacing of 5-10 cm x 3 cm.  Accordingly, seed rate varies from 10.0 kg  for large varieties to 12.0 kg for temperate European types.  For round cultivars, sow seeds on soil  surface and put a layer of soil above it.   Seeds of large cultivars are sown 1.5-3.0 cm deep.  Usually seeds are sown in phased manner to  get continuous supply of roots.<br />
            Hafeez and Hudson (1967) narrated  beneficial effects of hardening radish seeds by subjecting them to 2 cycles of  wetting and drying in which they are allowed to absorb water equivalent to 25%  of weight and alter dried at 2.2oC.<br />
<strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
            Radish requires plenty of water from  sowing to harvest.  For rapid germination  and subsequent production of roots, soil should be moist and loose.  So irrigate immediately after sowing.  If irrigation is restricted, roots will be  tougher and pungent, making it unfit for marketing.<br />
<strong>Inter-culture</strong><br />
            In radish, the epicotyl’s grows up  and develops into root tubers.  As it  grows in size, there is a tendency to bulge out.  These roots are to be covered by way of one  earthing up, which will take care of weeds also.<br />
<strong>Harvesting</strong><br />
            Depending up on the cultivar, roots  will be ready for harvest in 25-55 days after sowing.  If harvesting is delayed, roots will become  bitter and pithy.  Harvesting is done  manually.  A light irrigation is given  before pulling out roots.  After harvesting,  roots are washed, made into bundles and marketed along with a few leaves.<br />
<strong>Yield</strong><br />
            European varieties yield 5-7 t/ha  while in Indian cultivars, it varies from 15-20 t/ha.  Radish roots can be stored for 2-3 days under  room temperature without impairing quality.   Roots can be stored for about 2 months at 0oC and 90-95% RH.<br />
<strong>Seed production</strong><br />
            Seeds of European varieties an  produced in hills and tropical types in plains.   As it belongs to family Cruciferae, it is cross-pollinated and  pollination is done by bees.  Hence,  provide isolation distance as in cabbage or cauliflower.  Wild mustard, wild turnip and wild radish  should also be removed from field.  Roots  left in <em>situ, </em>without harvesting,  produce maximum quantity of seeds.  One  additional earthing up is required during flowering and fruiting stages to  prevent lodging of plants.  For producing  quality seeds, roots are pulled out and true-to-type roots alone are  replanted.  Usual practice is to remove ½  to ¾ of lower root portion before planting.   However, it reduces yield considerably.   Hence, replanting roots with minimum injury is advisable for high  yield.  Seed yield varies from 600-800  kg/ha.<br />
<strong>Pests and diseases</strong><br />
            A few of the important diseases of  radish are <em>Alternaria </em>blight, white  rust and radish mosaic.<br />
Alternaria blight: It is caused by <em>Alternaria rapham. </em>Symptoms and control  measures already discussed under Cole-crops.<br />
            White rust (<em>Albugo candida</em>): It produces white powdery substance in patches on  under-surface of leaves.  Disease  symptoms appear on leaves and flowering shoots, which become deformed and  produce malformed flowers.  Use of  resistant cultivars like Arka Nishant and regular sprayings with mancozeb  (0.2-0.3%) are recommended.</p>
