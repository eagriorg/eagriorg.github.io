                    <strong>AMARANTHUS  - <em>Amaranthus </em>spp. </strong><strong>(2n  = 32, 34, 64) - </strong>(Hindi: <em>Chaulai</em>)<br />
                    <strong>Family: Amaranthaceae</strong><br />
			    <p> Amaranth is the most common leaf  vegetable grown in Kerala and Tamil Nadu.   Leaves and succulent stem are good sources of iron (38.5 mg/100g),  calcium (350-400 mg/100g), vitamin A and vitamin C.  Absorption of calcium from amaranth is  however poor.  The iron availability is  only about 15.2 – 53.6% of total iron.   High oxalate content (1-2%) and nitrate (1.8-8.8 g/ kg dry matter)  levels are reported from leaves of various species. Short duration, quick  response to manures and fertilizers, high yield, easiness in cultivation and  availability of diverse types suited to specific agro-climatic situations make  it a favourite crop of farmers to fit in any cropping systems.  Both leaf and grain types play a vital role  to combat malnutrition of poor people.<br />
  <strong>Origin and distribution</strong><br />
				  Centres of diversity for amaranth  are Central and South America, India, South East Asia with secondary centres of  diversity in West and East Africa.  Leaf  amaranth is a native of India.<br />
				  Taxonomists recognize two sections  in <em>Amaranthus, viz., Amaranthus and  Blitopsis,</em> Section A<em>maranthus, </em>includes  important grain types where the inflorescence is terminal.  Section <em>Blitopsis </em>includes leaf types and flowers are borne in clusters in leaf axils.<br />
				  Majority of leaf cultivars grown in  India belong to <em>Amaranthus tricolor. </em> Major species found in India are:</p>

				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Botany</strong><br />
            Amaranth is an annual herb with  erect growth and scarce to profuse branching habit.  Stem is succulent and green or purple or  mixed shades of these two.  Leaf is  simple, alternate, with obviate to lanceolate shape.  Leaf colour is green or red or with different  shades of above.  Flowers are borne  terminally and in axils of leaves in clusters.   Basic unit of inflorescence is called as glomerule.  Flowers are small, unisexual and  monoecious.  Most of cultivated types are  monoecious.  Proportion of male and  female flowers varies in an inflorescence.   Each glomerule consists of a staminate flower and a number of pistillate  flowers.  The extent of cross pollination  is governed by proportion of male and female flowers in an inflorescence and  position of inflorescence in plant.   Percentage of male flowers in a glomerule is 0.5 in grain types and  10.25 in leaf types.  According to Pal  and Khoshoo (1978), leaf amaranths are predominantly self pollinated due to  presence of a large number of male flowers per glomerule, terminal  inflorescence and development of axillary glomerules.  Grain types favour cross pollination.<br />
            Stigma of pistillate flower is  receptive several days prior to opening of staminate flowers in an  inflorescence.  Wind help in transfer of  pollen grains from male flowers of a glomerule / inflorescence / plant to  another glomerule / inflorescence / plant.   But grain species with colorful inflorescence are occasionally visited  by bees (Khoshoo and Pal, 1970).<br />
            Chromosome number varies with  species in amaranth.  The diploid species  have 2n=32 or 34.  A <em>tricolor </em>is with 2n=34 white <em>A.  cruentus </em>and <em>A. tristis </em>have  2n=32.  The tetraploid species, <em>A dubius </em>has 2n=64.</p>

                <p><strong>Varieties</strong><br />
                  Cultivated leaf amaranth varieties  and cultivars differ in size, shape and colour of leaves and stem, position of  inflorescence etc. and belong to different species.  A brief description of improved varieties  developed by different Research Institutes is given below:<br />

                    <strong>Ark Arunima (<em>A. tricolor</em>):</strong>A multicult variety  with broad dark purple leaves.  First  picking starts in 30 days after sowing and two subsequent cuttings at 10-12 days  interval.  Yield 27 t/ha.<br />
                    <strong>Climate and Soil</strong><br />
                  Amaranthus  is widely distributed in both tropical and sub tropical regions.  Leaf amaranth is a warm season crop adapted  to hot humid climatic conditions.  It is  grown throughout the year in tropics and in autumn, spring and summer seasons  in temperate regions.  Most of leaf types  are day neutral in habit but differ in their day length requirements and  respond differently to changes in photo and thermoperiodism. Grain types, <em>A. caudatus, A. cruentus </em>and <em>A. edulis </em>are short day species while <em>A. hypochondriacus </em>is day neutral.<br />
                  Amaranth comes up well in well  drained loamy soil rich in organic matter.   The ideal is pH is 5.5-7.5 but there are types which can come up in  soils with pH as high as 10.0.  Red  amaranth requires bright sunlight for colour development.<br />
  <strong>Land preparation and sowing</strong><br />
                  Amaranth is harvested by pulling out  and by frequent clippings (multicut).   Cultivation practices differ according to method of harvest, duration,  growth pattern of variety, etc.<br />
                  Land is prepared to a fine tilth by  thorough ploughing and harrowing.  Well  decomposed and powdered organic matter @ 20-25 t/ha is incorporated with the  soil at the time of final ploughing.<br />
  <strong>Direct sowing</strong><br />
                  For direct sowing, field is divided  into small plots of about 3.0-3.6 m long and 1.5-1.8 m width with irrigation  channels running between every two plots.   In case of irrigation by pot watering, reduce width of plots to 90-100  cm.  Amaranth seeds, being small in size,  are mixed with fine sand and sown uniformly by broadcasting.  The seeds are covered either by raking up  soil and by covering with a thin layer of sand or soil.  This is followed by a light irrigation.  Soil is kept moist by frequent  irrigation.  Grown up seedlings are  selectively pulled out at 30 days after sowing and marketed in small bundles  along with roots.  Seed rate for direct  sowing is 2.0-2.5 kg/ha.<br />
                  After first pulling, urea is  broadcasted in beds and irrigated for quick growth of remaining seedlings so  that second pulling out is possible 10-15 days after first pulling.  This is repeated so that final pulling is  over by 55-60 days after sowing.<br />
  <strong>Transplanted method</strong><br />
                  This is mainly practiced for  multi-cut varieties.  The land, after  thorough ploughing and leveling, is made into shallow trenches / basins of  50-60 cm width and convenient length.   Well decomposed farmyard manure is applied in trenches and thoroughly  incorporated in soil by digging.  20-25  days old seedlings, already raised in nursery, are transplanted in trenches at  20-25 x 10-15 cm spacing.  Seed  requirement for transplanted crop is only 500 g/ha.<br />
  <strong>Manures and fertilizers</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Amaranth is a heavy feeder and high  yielding crop.  20-25 tonnes of FYM and  50:25:20 kg NPK / ha are recommended as basal dose.  Under pulling out method, 20 kg N should be  top dressed twice during subsequent pulling out of seedlings.  For clipping varieties, a still higher dose  of 75:25:25 is advisable.  Apply N after  every clipping or cutting.  Foliar spray  of 1% urea or diluted cow urine at every harvest is good for promoting further  growth and for high yield.<br />
  <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
                  Grain amaranth is a drought tolerant  crop, but leaf amaranth requires frequent irrigation to keep soil moist.  Frequency of irrigation depends on soil.<br />
  <strong>Interculture</strong><br />
                  Amaranth is a short duration and  shallow rooted crop.  Provide light  hoeing to prevent soil crust formation after irrigation and to keep soil  loose.  Field also should be kept  weed-free, especially during initial stages.</p>
                <p><strong>Harvesting</strong><br />
            Amaranth is harvested early in the  morning by pulling out or by clipping.   In the first method, grown up plants are pulled out at 30, 45 and 55  days after sowing, along with roots, washed and sent to market in small  bundles.<br />
            In multi-cut method, first clipping  or cutting is done 25-35 days after sowing.   Subsequent cuttings are made at weekly intervals in Chhotti Chaulai and  10 days intervals in Badi Chaulai.<br />
<strong>Bolting</strong><br />
            Premature flowering or bolting is a  serious problem in cultivation of amaranth.   Quality and yield are deteriorated after flowering.  Bolting is usually associated with planting  of short day varieties during November-December, deficiency of nitrogen,  extreme high temperature and poor soil aeration.  Practices like raising of crop at ideal time  depending on locality, frequent application of nitrogen fertilizers and manures  and keeping soil loose by light hoeing prolong flowering.<br />
<strong>Seed production</strong><br />
            Provide an isolation distance of 400  m for foundation and 200 m for certified seed production in amaranth.  For seed production, seedlings are transplanted  at a wider spacing of 3-45 x 30 cm.  Crop  may be left for seed production after making one or two cuttings for vegetable  harvests.  Inflorescence is harvested  when glumes turn brown in colour and seeds turn black.  Spikes are initially dried in sun to 15%  moisture.  After drying, inflorescence is  threshed with pliable bamboo sticks for separation of seeds.  Seeds are then winnowed and sieved through 2  mm sieve.  Seeds are finally dried to 7%  moisture and stored.  Seed rate varies  from 450 kg to 500 kg/ha.<br />
<strong>Pests and diseases</strong><br />
            Leaf blight and white rust are major  problems in amaranth cultivation.<br />
<strong>Leaf blight (<em>Rhizoctonia spp</em>).</strong><br />
            Leaf blight disease is the most  severe during rainy season under warm and humid conditions.  Symptoms include appearance of white and  irregular spots on leaf lamina making the produce unmarketable.<br />
The  package suggested for control of leaf blight is given below:</p>

                    <strong><em>Beta  vulgaris var. bengalensis</em></strong><br />
                            <p>Spinach  beet is one of the most common leafy vegetables of tropical and sub tropical  regions. The popular palak growing states include Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal,  Maharashtra and Gujarat. However, Palak is not very popular in South India. It  is primarily used as potherb. It is a rich Source of vitamin A and C and also  contains appreciable amount of protein, calcium and iron. The leaves contain  low oxalic acid. </p>

                <p><strong>Origin and taxonomy </strong><br />
                  Spinach  beet is most probably a native of Indo Chinese region. It was known in China as early as 647 AD. Spinach beet,  swiss chard and garden beet has a chromosome number 2n=2x=18, indicates their  close relationship. Leaves of this crop  might have been first used in Bengal and hence it is known as <em>Beta vulgaris var. bengalensis </em><br />
                  The  basic methods employed for the development of palak include introduction,  selection especially mass selection and hybridization. Mass selection is also employed for the maintenance of  cultivars. The best individual plants are selected on the, basis of their  phenotypic performance and their seeds are composited for raising the following  generation of large nµmber of plants are selected to avoid inbreeding depression. <br />
                  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
                  <strong>Punjab Green:</strong> This  cultivar was developed by Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, through  selection. Its plants are semi-erect; foliage is shining dark green, thick,  long and broad. The leaves are succulent and free from sourness. There is mild  purple pigment on the stem. It is ready for first cutting 30 days after sowing.  Its average yield is 3 tonnes/ha. It is slow bolter. <br />
                  <strong>Pusa Jyoti:</strong> This  cultivar was developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi  by polyploidization of the culture as a result of induced mutageneis using All  Green as a source material. It has very big leaves with dark­ colour. Leaves  are thick, tender, succulent and crisp. The plants are very vigorous, quick  growing and regenerate quickly after each cutting. It yields about 50 tonnes  /ha in 6-8 cuttings. <br />
                  <strong>HS 23:</strong> This  cultivar was developed by Haryana Agricultural University, Hissar, Harayana  through selection. It produces dark green, large, thick, tender and juicy  leaves. It is a quick growing cultivar and is ready for first cutting 30 days  after sowing. A total of 6-8 cuttings at two weeks interval can be obtained. <br />
                  <strong>Ooty 1:</strong> It was  developed at Horticultural Research Station, Ooty of Tamil Nadu Agricultural  University through selection from an introduction from Himachal Pradesh. Leaves  are green with a length of 40-50 cm and breadth of 8-10cm. The crop comes to  first harvest 45 days after sowing. Subsequent harvests can be done once in 15  days for 4 times. The yield is 1.5 tonnes/ha/cutting.<br />
                  <strong>All Green:</strong> It was  developed at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi It produces  green tender leaves and gives about 6-7 cuttings at 15-20 days interval. It  yields about 12 tonnes/ha. <br />
                  <strong>Pusa Harit:</strong> This  cultivar was developed by hybridization between sugar beet and local palak at  IARI Regional Station, Katrain, HP. It produces thick, green, large and  slightly crinkled leaves. It is a heavy yielder and has very late bolting habit  as it has low chilling requirement.<br />
                  <strong>Jobner Green:</strong> This  was developed at Jobner campus of University of Udaipur by selection from a  spontaneous mutation detected from a local collection, Sl. No 5. It produces  green, large, thick and tender leaves with strong flavour having entire margin.  It is a high yielder and gives an average yield of 30 tonnes/ha. <br />
                  <strong>Pusa Bharati:</strong> It is  the latest variety at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi. It  produces green, tender leaves. It has higher vitamin C content and beta  carotene than Pusa Jyoti. It is very high yielder and gives an average yield of  50 tonnes/ha. <br />
                  <strong>Climate and soil </strong><br />
                  Although  spinach beet is a winter season crop, it can be growth throughout the year  under mild temperature conditions. It can tolerate frost better than other  vegetables. It can also tolerate warm weather but high temperature leads to pre­mature  bolting without giving economic yield.   Palak can be grown on any type of soil possessing good fertility and  drainage but sandy loam soil is most suitable. Although, Palak can tolerate  slightly alkaline soil; high yields of better quality greens are produced in  neutral soils having a pH of 7.0. <br />
                  <strong>Sowing and spacing </strong><br />
                  The main  sowing season in plains is from last week of August to second week of November.  In places with mild climate, it may grow throughout the year. In hilly regions,  palak is sown from March-May. To improve germination, seeds are soaked in water  overnight before sowing.<br />
                  Sowing  can be done either by broadcast method or by line sowing. Line sowing is more  desirable as it facilities weeding, hoeing and harvesting. Line spacing is  maintained at 20cm and thinning IS done to maintain plant spacing within lines  at about 5cm. Seed rate varies with the crop season. For winter crop, use  10-15kg seed/ha and for summer crop 25-30kg/ha seed is required.<br />
                  <strong>Manuring and fertilizer requirement </strong><br />
                  As palak  is a leafy vegetable, it requires more nitrogen for crown growth. It is better  to apply fertilizers based on the soil analysis. In the absence of soil test,  PAU recommends 25 tonnes of farmyard manure, along with 87.5kg N and 30kg P2O5/ha.  Apply whole of farmyard manure and P205 and half of N at  the time of soil preparation. The remaining half N may be applied in two split  doses, one after each cutting followed by a light irrigation <br />
                  <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
                  In case  of insufficient soil moisture, apply first irrigation immediately after sowing.  Subsequent irrigations may be given at an interval of 4-6 days during summer  and 10-12 days during winter. However, rainy season crop does not require much  irrigation. <br />
                  <strong>Interculture and weeding </strong><br />
                  Hand  weeding is still a common practice to control weed. Generally 2-3 hoeing cum  hand weeding are required to control weed. It also helps to loosen soil for  proper aeration. <br />
                  <strong>Harvesting </strong><br />
                  The crop  will be ready for harvesting in about 3-4 weeks after sowing.  Subsequent cuttings should be taken at an  interval of 20-25 days depending upon variety and season. During summer, only  one harvesting is recommended. Harvesting is not done early in the morning  because there is dew on the crop. After harvesting it is washed, trimmed,  graded and bunched before marketing. <br />
