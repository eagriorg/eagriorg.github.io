                    <strong>Origin  and History</strong><br />
			    <p>The probable centre of origin of  potato is in South America in the central Andean region. Evidence indicates  that potatoes were cultivated for centuries by South American Indians and the  tubers were used as a common article of food. The Spaniards during invasion  found this economic plant worthy of introduction into Europe. The Spanish people  brought potato from Peru to Spain in 1565. Sir Francis drake probably brought  them to England about 1586. Following its introduction in to European  agriculture, potato became an important food crop of Italy, France, and  Ireland. During the famine years, the potato crop became valuable food crop in  Ireland. Potato was introduced to India from Europe in the beginning of the  seventeenth century, probably by the Portuguese, who were the first to open  trade routes to the east. The first mention of potato in India occurs in  ‘Terry’s account of a banquet at Ajmer given by Asaph Khan to Sir Thomas Rao in  1615. Potato was grown in many gardens of Surat and Karnataka in about 1675.  Cultivation of potato in northern hills started later than plains but became as  cash crop much earlier. Cultivation of potato was beginning first in the  Nilgiri hills in the 1822. The spread of potato is given in Figure1.<br />
  <strong>Nutritive  value and uses</strong><br />
				  It is one of the important crop of  the world. In India, it is used only as a vegetable. Sometimes it is also mixed  with other vegetables. It is also used for making of chips, halwa, gulab jamun,  rasgulla, murabha, kheer, guzia and barfi etc. According to Aykroyd (1941), it  contains 74.7 per cent water, 22.9 per cent sugar, .6 per cent protein, 0.1 per  cent fat, 0.6 per cent mineral matters, 0.01 per cent calcium, 0.03 per cent  phosphorus and 0.0007 per cent iron, while according to Macgillivray (1953), it  contains 77.8 per cent water, and food value per 100g of edible portion is  energy 85 calories, protein 2 g, calcium 13 mg , vitamin A 40 IU, ascorbic acid  12 mg, thiamine 0.11 mg, riboflavin 0.06 mg and niacin 1.18 mg and according to  Chatfield (1949) raw potato also contain in 100 g, edible portion: Na 3 mg, K  410 mg, Ca 14 mg, Mg 27 mg, Fe 0.8 mg, Cu 0.16 mg, P 56mg, S 29 mg and Cl 35  mg. The potato tuber may contain an alkaloid (Solanine), if it is exposed to  light. It is poisonous compound but 70 per cent of it is removed when potatoes  are peeled. This alkaloid may cause sickness or death both to live stock and  the human beings. Nadkarni (1927) has reported the following medicinal uses of  potatoes:<br />
				  It is anti-scorbutic. Persons with  neurotic and liver dyspepsia digest it well. It is also employed as an,  diuretic and galactagogue, nervous sedative and stimulant in gout. The leaves  in the form of extract are employed as an antispamodic in chronic cough  producing effects as those of optimum etc. potato grind into a paste is applied  as plaster to burns caused by fire with good results. The juice of the potato  is a dark colored liquid due to the presence of citric and succinic acids.  Potatoes may be mealy or non-mealy. Mealy potatoes are those in which the  cells, on cooking, separate from one another so that they may be piled up in  loose flour with air between them instead of remaining in a solid mass with  water in the small intercellular spaces. But this is absent in immature  potatoes due to low quantity of starch. Mealiness and high starch are  associated with high specific gravity. According to Covdon and Boussard (1897)  disruption of potatoes in cooking is partly due to turgidity of tissues, the  more turgid they are more easily do they fracture and permit the ready  penetration of boiling water.<br />
  <strong>Area  and Production</strong><br />
				  In  India out of total 5335447 ha of land under vegetables, potato occupies nearly  20.79 per cent area. The area (1109000 ha) under potato, during the year  1995-96 followed percentage change of –2.30, -10.56, -5.91 and 3.70 over  1991-92, 1992-93, 1993-94 and 1994-95, respectively. Production of potato was  18843300 MT during the year 1995-96, having 26.32 per cent share in the total  vegetable production.  Production  increased by 3.56, 1.97, 8.34 and 8.29 per cent over 1991-92, 1992-93, 1993-94  and 1994-95 respectively. The productivity of potato was 16.99 MT/ha, whereas  the highest 24.4 MT/ha was of West Bengal in the country (NHB, 1998) potato is  grown in almost all the states of India. It is mainly grown in the states like  Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Punjab, Karnataka, Assam and Madhya Pradesh. The  major potato producing belts in India are as given below (NHB, 1998).</p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Himachal  Pradesh: </strong>Shimla,  Lahul Spiti and Mandi.</li>

                    <strong>Classification,  Botany and Floral Biology</strong><br />
                    <strong>Classification</strong><br />
				  The  potato was first domesticated in the high plateau region of the Peruvian and  Bolivian Andes and has been grown for several millennia. A total of seven  cultivated species were domesticated and they remain the most important crop in  the high Andean, regions, where the greatest genetic diversity of cultivated  potato is concentrated (Engel, 1970). The cultivated potatoes species are as  given below:<br />

				<p><strong>The  commercial potato generally belong to two species</strong><br />
                  <strong><em>Solanum andigenum</em></strong><strong>:</strong> it is not very common. Plants have thin and long stem,  small and narrow leaflets. Flowers are produced more profusely. It has long  stolons and mostly coloured deep- eyed tubers.<br />
                  <strong><em>Solanum tuberosum</em></strong><strong>:</strong> It is more common, plants have shorter and thicker stem  larger and wider leaflets.<br />
In  addition to two species, there are also some important species, which shows  resistant to biotic and abiotic. Theses species are given in Table 2.<br />

<strong>Climatic  Requirements</strong> <br />
Potato is  basically cool season crop. It grows well from sea level to snow line, where  sufficient moisture and fertile soil are available. It is grown in winter in  plains of India. However, in northern hills, it is grown as summer season crop.  Potato is a long day plant but cultivated as~ day plant. It requires favourable  environmental conditions such as low temperature and short day conditions at  the time of tuberization for rapid bulking rate. About 20°C temperature is good  for tuber formation and it reduces as the temperature increases. Tuberization  is badly affected at about 300C temperature. At higher temperature,  the respiration rate increases and the carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis  are consumed rather than stored in tuber. High temperatures at any part of  growing period affect the size of leaflets, thereby reducing the tuber  formation. It grows best under long day conditions sunshine along with cooler  nights are essential for reducing the spread of diseases. <br />
<strong>Soil  Conditions</strong> <br />
Potato can  be produced on a wide range of soils, ranging from sandy loam, silt loam, loam  and clay soil. Soil for potato should be friable, well aerated, fairly deep and  well supplied with organic matter. Well- drained sandy loam and medium loam  soils are most suitable for potato cultivation. Soil structure and texture has  a marked effect on the quality of the tuber. Light soil is preferred, because  they tend to promote more uniform soil temperatures and make harvesting of the  crop easier. Alkaline or saline soil is not suitable for potato cultivation.  They are well suited to acidic soils (pH 5.0 to 6.5) as acidic conditions tend  to limit scab diseases.<br />
<strong>Planting  Time</strong><br />
<strong>In  Plains</strong><br />
<strong>Early Crop</strong><strong>:</strong> Third week of September to first week  of October.<br />
<strong>Main crop:</strong> First week of October to third week  of October.<br />
<strong>Late  Crop:</strong> Third week of  October to first week of November<br />
<strong>II. In Hills</strong><strong>: </strong>Potato is planted in  hills from the third week of February to second week of April. In the southern  hills near Ootacamund  in Nilgiris, planting  is done three times in a year, i.e. in the month of February, April and  September In the plateau regions of Maharashtra, Bihar Madhya Pradesh, potato  is raised in rainy and winter seasons.. In the Mysore plateau, the summer and  winter crop is planted in April-June and in October-December, respectively. <br />
<strong>Seed  Rate, Methods of Sowing and Spacing</strong><br />
The seed  requirements for a hectare on the basis of seed size are given below: <br />
Large size-  25-30 q/ha; Medium size- 15-20 q/ha; Small size- 10-15 q/ha; Out tubers- 8-12  q/h2:-' Potato is planted mainly by two methods:<br />
<strong>1. Ridge and Furrow Method:</strong> In this method, the ridges are  prepared. The length of the ridges depends on slope of the plot. Too long  ridges and furrows arc not supplied with irrigation water conveniently. The  potato tubers are planted on is let into furrows.<br />
<strong>2. Flat Bed Method</strong><strong>:</strong> In this method, the whole plot is  divided into beds of convenient length and width. The shallow furrows are  opened and potato tubers are planted at recommended distance. The tubers are  covered with the original soil of furrows. When the germination is completed  and plants become 10 to 12 cm height, earthing should be done. Suitable plant  spacing in relation to potato seed grades are given below:</p>

				<p><strong>Nutritional  Requirements and Their Management</strong><br />
				  Soils poor  in organic matter content should be supplied with 250 - 500 q/ha of farmyard  manure or compost during land preparation, preferably a fortnight before  planting. Potato plant is a heavy feeder. When it is grown in medium type of  soils, it needs 100 to 150 kg nitrogen, 80 to 100 kg phosphorous and 80 to 100  kg potassium per hectare. Two - third to three fourth quantity of nitrogen  along with whole quantity of phosphorus and potassium is applied at the time of  planting. Remaining one fourth to one third nitrogen is applied 30 to 35 days  after planting i.e. at the time of first earthing up or when plants become 25  to 30 cm in height either in the form of top dressing or as a foliar feeding.  Spraying of essential micronutrients such as boron, zinc, copper, iron,  manganese, molybdenum etc. is done when crop is showing deficiency symptoms.<br />
  <strong>Intercultural  Operations</strong> <br />
				  In potato  crop, both types of weeds are found i.e. broad-leaved weeds as well as narrow  leaved weeds-The use of weedicides in potato crop in general is not essential  because earthing up operation destroy almost all weeds, if some how, weed  plants are growing on ridges, they may be pulled out by hands. Pre- emergence  application of nitrogen @ 1.0 kg a.i./ha or alachlor @.2.0 kg a.i./ha or post  emergence application of propanil @ 1.0 kg a.i./ha may be used ill solution  fom1 (800-1000 litre/ha). Care should be taken while spraying of post-  emergence herbicides that they should not come in the contact to potato plants.  Proper development of tubers depends upon aeration, moisture availability and  proper soil temperature. Therefore, proper earthing up is necessary. Earthing  should be done when the plants are 15 to 22 cm ill height. Generally earthing  is done at the time of top dressing of nitrogenous fertilizers. The ridges  should be high enough to cover up tubers. If necessary, a second earthing may  be done after two -week of the first one. A mould board plough or a ridger may  be used for earthing up in large area.<br />
  <strong>Use of  Plant Growth Regulators</strong><br />
				  Soaking of  potato seed tuber in CCC at 500 mg/l (Schedule and Pandita, 1986), sodium  ascorbate at  100 mg/l (Murthy et al..  1975) cytozyme at 5 per cent (Pandita and Hooda, 1979), Singh and Kaur, 1981)  or foliar sprays with ethephon at 400 mg/l (Murthy and Banerjee, 1978, Pandita  and Hooda, 1979 a, Sekhon and Singh, 1985), CCC at 25 mg/l or garlic acid at  10-100 mg/l(Kumar and Agarwal, 1978) increased tuber yield. Sidda Reddy (1988)  also obtained higher tuber yield with foliar sprays of mixtallol at 1 or 2  mg/l.<br />
  <strong>Water  Management</strong><br />
				  Before  coming to the planting operation. It should be kept in mind that the sufficient  soil moisture is available for satisfactory sprouting. If not then light  pre-irrigation or just after planting may be given. The rate of water use is  low till 30-35 days after planting; it means that the first irrigation is  essentially done within 30-35 days after planting. However, when soil moisture  seems insufficient for sprouting, intervals of first irrigation should be  reduced. Further, irrigation is done as and when crop needs. As regards method  of irrigation in potato, the furrow method is commonly followed.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting,  Yield and Storage</strong><br />
				  Harvested  potatoes are heaped under shade for a couple of days, so that their skin  becomes hard and soil adhering with them is also separated out. Under good crop  management, 350-450 quintals of marketable potatoes of good quality can be  produced from one hectare land. The sorting operation is the most important, in  that all cut tubers, bruised, injured by insects-pest and disease are removed.  Sorted healthy tubers are graded in to different grades based on diameter of  the tubers reduce the prices in the market. Therefore, such tubers should be  sorted and marked separately. Over sized tubers are great in demand for chips  making. Very small sized tubers are also not remaining unsold. These tubers are  purchased by poor people for making vegetable by partially Cushing them before  cooking. However, both the over sized and under sized are quite unsuitable for  seed purposes. Potatoes can be stored in the cold storage at the temperatures  of 4 to 7oC and relative humidity. <br />
  <strong>Diseases  and Pests</strong><br />
  <strong>Diseases</strong><br />
  <strong>Non-Viral  Diseases</strong><br />
  <strong>Early  Blight (<em>Alternaria solani</em>)</strong><br />
				  The  infection appears on lower .leaves with necrotic spots having concentric rings.  The fungus survives in the soil. In diseased plant debris. The collateral host  is tomato. High moisture and low temperature are favourable for disease.<br />
  <strong>Control  Measures</strong> </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Follow  crop rotation</li>
				  <li>Collect  and bum plant debris after harvesting</li>
				  <li>Start  sprays the crop Dithane M-45 at 0.2 per cent 30 to 35 days after planting and  repeat I0 to 15 days interval</li>
				  <li>Grow  early blight tolerant varieties such as Kufri Naveen, Kufri Sjndhuri and Kufri  Jeevan. </li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Late  Blight (<em>Phytophthora infestans</em>)</strong><br />
				  The  infection appears at the tips or edges of the lower leaves with circular or  irregular water soaked spots. White downy fungus growth appears on the  underside of the leaves around the spots. Cloudy weather is conducive for very  fast spread of the disease. In case of sever incidence all above ground parts  may show rotting. Later the disease may spread to tubers and initiate rotting. <br />
  <strong>Control  Measures</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Plant  only healthy disease free certified seed tubers. </li>
				  <li>Spray the crop thoroughly with  diathane M-45 (2.0 kg/ha) or diathane Z- 78 (2.5 kg/ha) or difolatan (2.5  kg/ha) well in advance to general appearance of disease. The spraying  operations should remain continue at narrow interval of 5 to 6 days during  cloudy weather. (iii) Dig out tubers when foliage is completely dry or cleaned.  (iv) Grow late blight resistance varieties like Kufri Navaharl. (v) Avoid  applying in excess nitrogen and irrigation.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Black  Scurf (<em>Rhizoctonia solani</em>)</strong><br />
				  The  infected plants killed, stem canker may also be formed. Affected plants may  form aerial tubers. On tubers, black sclerotial bodies are formed. It is a soil  as well as tuber borne disease.<br />
  <strong>Control Measures</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Always  sow certified seeds</li>
				  <li>Treat the seed tubers with any organo  mercurial fungicides containing 6 per cent mercury {agallol, aretan, emisan  etc.) for about 5 to 10 minutes before the planting and also seed tubers before  keeping in the cold storage. (iii) Dip the tubers in 1.75 per cent solution of  sulfuric acid for 20 minutes. (iv) Apply Brassicol at 30 kg per hectare in the  soil at the time of sowing. (v) Apply sawdust at 25 q/ha with recommended doses  of nitrogen at least 15 days before sowing.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Common  Scab of Potato (<em>Streptomyces scabies</em>)</strong><br />
				  It survives  in soil years together and on infected tubers in cold storage. It may also  spread through manure. Affected tubers show the superficial roughened areas of  corky tissue, often slightly below the plane of healthy skin of tubers. Low  soil moisture is favourable for proliferation of causal pathogen.<br />
  <strong>Control  Measures</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Obtain  healthy, disease free seed tubers for planting. </li>
				  <li>Disinfect the tubers by dipping in  suspension of mercurial fungicide e.g. emisan-6 or agallol- 6 at 0.25 per cent  concentration for 5 minutes, (iii) Plant the tubers shallow. (IV) Keep the soil  wet during tuberization. (v) Follow crop rotation with non-host crops including  beets, carrot etc. (VI) Maintain soil pH 5.0 to 5.3.   </li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Black  Leg or Soft Rot (<em>Erwinia spp</em>.)</strong><br />
				  It is  caused by different species of bacteria. The base of shoots develops a  blackened shriveled cortex and its growth is stunted. Leaflets become reddish  in colour at the tips, branches become stiffened and more upright than normal.  The affected haulms are jet black in colour at the soil level. The tubers  become watery and upon rotting give off offensive sulphurous odour.<br />
  <strong>Control  Measures</strong>: </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Obtain  healthy seed tubers for planting. </li>
				  <li>Avoid  planting of cut seed potato. </li>
				  <li>Avoid  planting too early and too late in the season. </li>
				  <li>Collect  and destroy affected plants as and when seen in the field. </li>
				  <li>Avoid  injury to tubers during harvesting, transit and storage.</li>
				  <li>Wash  the tubers with chlorinated water before storage.</li>
				  <li> Keep the stores well ventilated, dry and cool. </li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Bacterial  Brown Rot or Wilt Disease</strong> (<strong><em>Pseudomonas solanacearum</em></strong>)<br />
				  Affected  plants show dwarfing and bronze discolouration of the leaflets. When affected  stem or tubers cut across, the browning of the xylem vessel is seen, and upon  squeezing, the whitish bacterial ooze may come out.<br />
  <strong>Control  Measures</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Obtain  healthy, disease free seed tubers for planting. </li>
				  <li>Collect  and destroy infected plants. </li>
				  <li>Avoid  flowing rain or irrigation water from diseased field to healthy one.</li>
				  <li>Disinfect cutting knife with a  suitable bactericide solution, whenever diseased tubers are cut. </li>
				  <li>Follow crop rotation with non-host  crops such as maize, soybean and red top grass for at least three years in the  field, </li>
				  <li>Reduce the application of organic  manure (it promotes activity of bacteria) but apply high doses of inorganic  fertilizers (decrease the activity). </li>
				  <li> Treat the seed tubers in 0.02 per  cent sueptocycine for 30 minutes after giving five mm deep cut. </li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Charcoal  Rot (<em>Macrophmina phaseoli</em>)</strong><br />
				  The roots  of the affected plants become brown in colour. The rotting starts on the stem  portion. The skin of the stern becomes ash coloured.lne dark lesions appear at  the lenticels of the tubers and also round the stern end of tuber. Charcoal rot  is common during the hot and dry months in late season crops. <br />
  <strong>Control  Measures</strong> </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Obtain disease free seed tubers for  planting. Hill potatoes are nearly free from this pathogen. </li>
				  <li>Grow  early maturing varieties such as Kufri Alankar or Kufri Chandramukhi. </li>
				  <li>Irrigate  crop at regular intervals. </li>
				  <li>Seed tubers may be treated with  ageUal-6 or aretan at 0.25 per cent solution before  </li>
			    </ol>
				<p>    storage. The treated tubers should not be  eaten.<br />
                    <strong>Wart  Disease of Potato (<em>Synchytrium endobioticum</em>)</strong></p>
				<p>It is a caused by the fungus. Affected plants  show warty out growth protuberances on sterns, stolons and tubers. The roots  are not affected. The wart consists of distorted,</p>
				<p>proliferated-branched  structures grown together into a mass of hyper parasitic tissue. It is  difficult to control once it has been established in a field.<br />
                  <strong>Control  Measures</strong> </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Avoid  growing potatoes in known wart-affected soil. </li>
				  <li>Obtain disease free seed tubers for  planting. (iii) Soil treatment with 5 per cent formalin is effective but very  costly. (iv)Grow wart tolerance varieties like Kufri Sherpa, Kufri Jyoti, Kufri  Jeevan and Kufri Muthu. </li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Viral  Diseases</strong><br />
                    <strong>Leaf  Roll</strong><br />
				  A virus known as potato leaf roll  virus, potato virus 1, solanum virus 14 or Corium solani Holmes causes it.  Transmission of virus in nature occurs through infected tubers and through  insect, an aphid (Myzus persicae). Affected plants become dwarf, more upright  thin normal, the leaves are rolled, especially the lower one. They are thick  and leathery.<br />
  <strong>Mosaic  Disease</strong><br />
				  Potato crop is affected by mainly  three types of mosaic. </p>

				<p><strong>Phytoplasma  Diseases</strong><br />
                    <strong>Potato Witches Broom</strong><br />
				  Infected  plants develop many axillary and basal shoots giving 'witches broom' appearance  and develop small, pigmented tubers. These tubers sprout even attached to  infected plants (Nagaich et al., 1974). The disease is transmitted by grafting  and leafhopper (Orosius albicintus). Tuber transmission is also very high. The  pathogen can infect tomato, brinjal, <em>Datura fastuo.va</em>, <em>D. metel,  Nicandra physaloides</em>, <em>Vinca rosea</em> and <em>Calendula officinalis</em>.  This disease can be controlled by hot water treatment of 'witches broom'  affected tubers at 50 °C for 10 minutes, causes degeneration of pathogen and  plants developed from such tubers did not develop symptoms upto 6 to 7 weeks.<br />
  <strong>Purple  Top of Potato</strong><br />
				  The typical  symptoms are purple pigmentation and rolling of basal parts of leaflets of  young top leaves. The affected plants are stunted have many axillary shoots  with aerial tubers. Root system is poorly developed (Nagaich and Giri, 1973).  It causes phloem fluorescence. The disease is transmitted by grafting and  leafhoppers (Alebroides nigrocutellatus, Orosius alibicinctus (and Seriance  equata), Tuber transmission is also common but the extent varies with age of  plants, the host range of pathogen includes tomato, tobacco, brinjal, clove,  Datura stramonium, Calelldula officinalis, Cyphomandra betaceu etc, Phyalis  floridana, Vinca rosea, Oxytetracycline, benlate, cycloheximide etc. are highly  effective and causes 70 to 96 per cent remission of symptoms.<br />
  <strong>Marginal  Falvescence of Potato</strong> <br />
				  Flavescence  or chlorosis along the margins of leaflets of upper leaves and small, narrow  leaflets are prominent symptoms, affected plants are stunted and produce  clusters of small tubers, which have shorter dormancy and produce hairy  sprouts. It causes phloem fluorescence (Nagaich and Giri, 1973). The disease is  transmitted by grafting and hopper, Seriana equate the disease can infect other  hosts like, tomato, tobacco, brinjal, calendula officinalis, physalis  flloridana, vinca rosea, and cyphomandra betacea. Treatment of affected plants  with antiamoebin + benlate or benlate + BP causes remission upto 80 per cent.<br />
  <strong>Potato  Phyllody</strong><br />
				  The disease  is characterized by extreme hairiness and roughing of leaves and stems.  Chlorotic leaves develop small leaflets but enlarged petioles. Infected plants  develop several naked androecia as small yellow &quot;rosettes&quot; and  axillary aerial tubers Phyllod flowers are enlarged and have cupped clays and  corolla (Khurana et al 1983). It has wide host range and includes Dianthus  barbatus, Pisum sativum, Lycopersicon chilense, Phyalis floridana, Solunum  nigrum and Daucus carota. The pathogen can be eliminated by subjecting infected  tubers to hot water treatment at 50 °C for 10-15 minutes.<br />
  <strong>Pests</strong><br />
  <strong>Cut  Worms</strong> <strong>(Agrotis spp, Euxoa spp)</strong><br />
				  They cut  the sprouts at ground level. They feed only at night. They also attack tubers  and make holes, thereby reducing market prices. <br />
  <strong>Control  Measures</strong> </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Spray  the crop with dursban 20 EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water or drench the plants,  where the damage is noticed.</li>
				  <li>Apply  phorate 10 G granules at 10 kg I per hectare on soil around the plants and rake  the soil thereafter. </li>
				  <li>Use  only well rotten farmyard manure.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Epilachna  Beetle</strong><br />
				  Both the  adults and larvae of this beetle feed on skeletonization of leaves.<br />
  <strong>Control  Measures</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Pick  up the eggs, larvae and adults by hands. </li>
				  <li>Spray  the crop with carbaryl at 0.1 per cent.</li>
				  <li>Dust  the crop with sevin dust at 30 kg per hectare.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Leaf  Eating Caterpillars<em> (Spilosoma obliqua, Spodoptera exigua</em></strong>):<br />
				  Both the caterpillars cause damage by  feeding potato leaves.<br />
  <strong>Control  Measures</strong><br />
				  (i) Spray the crop with thiodon 35 EC  or endocel at 0.15 per cent<br />
				  (ii) Making border around the field  with carbaryl dust would be effective control. <br />
  <strong>Aphids (<em>Myzus  persicae</em></strong>)<br />
				  Aphids  sucks the sap from leaves. Affected plants become weak, leaves become yellow  and curl downwards. Aphid secretes honeydew, which gives rise to sooty mould  and other fungal diseases.<br />
  <strong>Control  Measures</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Spray  the crop with rogor or metasystox or nuvacron or monocil at 1 ml per liter of  water, and repeat the spray 10 to 12 days interval</li>
				  <li>Apply  thimate 10 G granules at 10 kg per hectare in furrows at the time of planting.</li>
				  <li>Cut  the haulms in the first week of January to check the transmission of virus  through seed potatoes.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Jassids</strong><br />
				  They are  slender wedge shaped green hopping insects. They are diagonally. They suck sap  from under surface of leaves causing yellowing, curling and later burning of  leaves called 'hopper bums' <br />
  <strong>Control  Measures</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Spray  the crop with metasystox at 0.1 per cent.</li>
				  <li>Apply  thimet 10 g granules at 10 kg per hectare in furrows at the time of planting.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Potato  Tuber Moth (Phthorimaea operculella)</strong><br />
				  It is major  pest of potato in storage. It can also attack in the field. It bores and makes  tunnel into the potato tubers.<br />
  <strong>Control  Measures</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Sow  healthy insect free potato tubers.</li>
				  <li>Use  only well rotten farmyard manure.</li>
				  <li>Do earthing carefully, so that tuber  is not exposed in the field to ovipositing female moths</li>
				  <li>Spray  the crop with carbaryl or nuvacron or monocil at 0.1 per cent. </li>
				  <li>Disinfect  the go down with Malathion at 0.05 per cent before storing potatoes. </li>
				  <li>Sort  out all affected tubers before storage.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Golden Nematode (Globodera rostochiensis, Heterodera  rostochiensis)</strong><br />
				  It is also  known as potato root ell worm or potato cyst nematode. The infected plants  produced additional rootlets near the soil surface. Later, outer leaves become  prematurely yellow and die.<br />
  <strong>Control  Measures</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Keep  the infested area in quarantine to prevent the spread</li>
				  <li>Avoid  growing tomato or brinjal in infested soil. </li>
				  <li>Follow  crop rotation excluding solanaceous crop.</li>
				  <li>Treat  the soil with DD at the rate of90 gallons per hectare. </li>
