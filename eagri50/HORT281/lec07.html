				<p align="center"><strong>Origin, area, production, varieties, package of  practices for Cucurbitaceous vegetables </strong><br />
				  <p>Crops  belonging to family Cucurbitaceae are generally known as ‘Cucurbits’.  It consists of a wide range of vegetables  either used for salad purpose (cucumber) or for cooking (all gourds), pickling  (West Indian gherkin) or as dessert fruit (muskmelon, water melon) or candied  or preserved (ash gourd).  As a group,  cucurbits occupy the largest area in India and in other tropical countries.  Its use is not primarily because of calories,  minerals or vitamins since they are generally low to moderate in nutrients with  a few exceptions like bitter gourd (rich in vitamin C 96 mg/100g), parwal and  chow chow (calcium – 531 mg and 140 mg / 100 g respectively).  From the nutritional point of view, cucurbit  seeds are valued for their high oil and protein contents.  Seed proteins of cucurbits are comparable to  that of legumes and are richer in methionine.<br />
				  Taxonomic classification of the  family is differently by botanists.  The  family Cucurbitaceae comprises about 117 genera and 825 species in warmer  parts.  Chakravarthy (1982) estimated 36  genera and 100 species in India.<br />
  <strong>General features</strong><br />
				  Cucurbit vegetables have the  following common features:</p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Long tap root system – Tap root       may grow up to 175-180 cm and laterals are confined to top 60 cm.  Hence crops like bottle gourd, ash gourd       and parwal are largely utilized in river bed cultivation.</li>
				  <li> Branched stem-Stem is 3-8 branched and       prostrate / climbing and spread up to 9-10 m in <em>Cucurbita </em>and <em>Lagenaria.  </em>Crops like <em>Cucurbita pepo </em>have short internodes and are bushy.  Nodes usually produce roots by touching       on soil</li>
				  <li>Leaves are simple, mostly 3-5       lobed, palmate and rarely pinnately lobed (<em>Citrullus </em>sp.).</li>
				  <li>Tendrils on axils of leaves are       simple in <em>Cucumis, </em>simple or       bifid in others and absent in bush types.</li>
				  <li>Cucurbits are highly cross       pollinated and pollination is done by honey bees and bumble bees.  Flowers are born in axils of leaves and       are solitary or in racemose clusters.        Individual flowers are unisexual, large and showy.</li>
				  <li>Fruit is essentially an inferior       berry and is called as “pep” due to hard rind when mature.  Fruits can be stored for long period in       ash gourd, pumpkin, oriental pickling melon, etc. while keeping quality is       less in cucumber, snake gourd, bitter gourd, etc.  The fruits of all cucurbits except chow       chow are many seeded.</li>
				  <li>Seeds are borne in parietal       placentation-Placenta is the edible portion in water melon while in ash       gourd, ridge gourd and smooth gourd it is endocarp.  In muskmelon, edible portion is mostly       pericarp with a little mesocarp.</li>
				  <li>Cucurbits are mostly seed       propagated.  A few are vegetative       propagated like parwal and coccinia.</li>
				  <li>Most cucurbits are annuals except       chow chow and coccinia, both having perennial habit.</li>
				  <li>Cucurbitacins – Majority of       cucurbits are characterized by presence of bitter principles,       cucurbitacins at some portions of plant and at some stages of       development.  Cucurbitacins are       tetracyclic triterpins having extensive oxidation levels.  Its highest concentration is in fruits       and roots and is less in leaves.        Pollen grain also carries fairly good amount of bitter       principles.  This is a common       problem in oriental pickling melon, cucumber and bottle gourd and is       rarely noticed in ridge gourd and snake gourd.  The consumers usually remove fruit tips       during conception to avoid possible chance of bitterness in fruits.</li>
				  <li>Sex forms – A wide range of sex       forms like monoecious, andro monoecious, gynandro monoecious and dioecious       forms are noticed in the family.</li>
			    </ol>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li><em>Hermaphrodite       form - </em>This is       the most primitive form and bisexual flowers only are produced in a       plant.  This is noticed in Satputia       variety of ridge gourd and in a few lines of cucumber and mush melon.</li>
				  <li><em>Monoecious       form - </em>This is       the advanced form and plants produce both male and female flowers in a       plant.  Majority of the cucurbits       exhibit monoecious condition.</li>
				  <li><em>Andromonoecious       form </em>– Muskmelon       and some cultivars of water melon produce both male and bisexual flowers       in a plant.  However, non dessert       forms like oriental pickling melon, photo under <em>Cucumis melo </em>are monoecious.</li>
				  <li><em>Gynomonoecious </em>- This is       noticed in cucumber and the plants produce female and bisexual flowers.</li>
				  <li><em>Gynoecious       form </em>-Lines producing female flowers       alone are rarely noticed in cucumber and have got great potential for       commercial F1 production.</li>
				  <li><em>Trimonoecious       form</em>- This is a       condition wherein, the male, female and bisexual flowers are produced in a       single plant</li>
				  <li><em>Dioecious       form </em>– Male and       female flowers are produced on separate plants in parwal, coccinia and       kakrol.</li>
			    </ul>
				<strong><br clear="all" />
                </strong>
                <p><strong>Flowering</strong><br />
                  Majority of cucurbits start  flowering 30-45 days after sowing and it follows a definite sequence.  An alternate sequence of male and female  flowers follows upto fruit set.  The first  4-6 flowering nodes bear male flowers and alter female flowers.  Developing fruits in a vine determine  production of further female flowers further down in the vine.  In crops where immature fruits are harvested  at tender stage, this kind of inhibiting mechanism will not be  perceptible.  But in melon, pumpkin, ash  gourd etc. even if perfect or female flowers are produced in the vine, fruits  may not set or develop fully or shed in immature condition.  That is why number of fruits / vine in a seed  crop will be less (4-5) than in a vegetable crop (12-15) in bottle gourd, ash  gourd and cucumber.<br />
  <strong>Pollination</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Pollination takes place early in  morning between 6-8 am in cucumber, pumpkin, muskmelon and watermelon.  Pollination is altered in the day when  temperature is high in bottle gourd and ridge gourd.  In snake gourd and pointed gourd, anthesis  takes place during night and pollination early in the morning.<br />
                  In pumpkin, pollen production is  more while in muskmelon, pollen production is scanty and pollen grains are  sticky due to oily film surrounding them.<br />
                  Extent of cross pollination in  cucurbits is 60-80%.  They are  entomophilous and bees, beetles and moths cause pollination.<br />
  <strong>Sex modification</strong><br />
                  Majority of cucurbits are monoecious  and sex ratio (male: female) ranges from    25-30:1 to 15:1.  Sex ratio is  influenced by environmental factors. High N content in the soil, long days and  high temperature favour maleness.   Besides environmental factors, endogenous levels of auxins,  gibberellins, ethylene and abscisic acid also determine sex ratio and sequence  of flowering.  A primordium can form  either a female or a male flower and it can be manipulated by addition or  deletion of auxins.  Endogenous  application of plant growth regulators can alter sex form, if applied at 2-4  leaf stage.  High ethylene level induces  female sex and is suggested to increase female flowers in cucumber, musk melon,  summer squash and pumpkin. In cucumber, maleic hydrazide (50-100 ppm) GA 3  (5-10 ppm), Ethrel (150-200 ppm), TIBA (25-50 ppm), boron (3 ppm) also induce  female flowers.<br />
                  Gibberellins promote maleness and  are antagonistic to the action of ethylene and abscisic acid.  In fact, gynoecious line of cucumber is  maintained by inducing male flowers through spray of GA 3 (1500-2000 ppm).  Silver nitrate (300-400 ppm) also induces maleness.</p>
