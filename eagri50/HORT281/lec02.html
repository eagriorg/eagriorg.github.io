				<p align="center"><strong>vegetable gardens</strong><br />
                    <strong>Kitchen garden or nutrition garden</strong><br />
			    <p>Kitchen garden or home garden or  nutrition garden is primarily intended for continuous supply of fresh  vegetables for family use.  A number of  vegetables are grown in available land for getting a variety of  vegetables.  Family members do most of  works.  Area of garden, lay out, crops  selected etc. depend on availability and nature of land.  In rural area, land will not be a limiting  factor and scientifically laid out garden can be established.  In urban areas, land is a limiting factor and  very often crops are raised in limited available area or in terraces of  buildings.  Cultivation of crops in pots  or in cement bags is also feasible in cities.<br />
				  The unique advantages of a kitchen  garden or home garden are :</p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Supply fresh fruits and       vegetables high in nutritive value</li>
				  <li>Supply fruits and vegetables free       from toxic chemicals</li>
				  <li>Help to save expenditure on       purchase of vegetables and economize therapy</li>
				  <li>Induces children on awareness of       dignity of labour</li>
				  <li>Vegetables harvested from home       garden taste better than those purchased from market.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Sites selection and size</strong><br />
				  Choice for selection of site for a  kitchen garden is limited due to shortage of land in homestead.  Usually a kitchen garden is established in  backyard of house, near water source in an open area receiving plenty of  sunlight.<br />
				  Size and shape of vegetable garden  depends on availability of land, number of persons in family and spare time  available for its care.  Nearly five  cents of land (200 M2) is sufficient to provide vegetables  throughout year for a family consisting of five members.  A rectangular garden is preferred to a square  plot or a long strip of land.<br />
  <strong>Layout </strong><br />
				  Layout of garden and selection of  crops suited to each season depends on agro-climatic conditions prevailing in  the area.  Depending on climatic and  seasonal changes, modifications are to be done in layout and crop  allotment.  General features / principles  to be followed in the layout are follows :</p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Perennial vegetables like       drumstick, curry leaf and bilimbi should be allotted to one side of the       garden so that they may neither shade remaining plants nor they interfere       with intercultural operations.        Shade loving vegetables like water leaf may be planted in perennial       plot.  One or two compost pits may       be provided on one corner of kitchen garden for effective utilization of       farm / kitchen waste.</li>
				  <li>Fences on all sides should be       made with barbed wire or with live stakes.        Fencing on four sides may be planting chekkurmanis, ivy gourd,       dolichos bean, trailing cowpea and ridge gourd.  Fence may be made strong by planting       agathi  (Sesbania grandiflora) at       1.0 m. distance along the fence.  An       arch made of red or green Basella may be erected at entry point or gate of       kitchen garden.</li>
				  <li>After allotting areas for perennial       crops, remaining portion is divided into 6-10 equal plots for raising       annual vegetable crops.  By       following scientific crop rotation, three annual crops can be raised in       the same plot.  Companion cropping       or accession cropping, inter cropping and mixed cropping can be followed       for effective utilization of space.</li>
				  <li>Provide walking path at centre as       well as along four sides.  Path can       be made attractive by planting red and green amaranth or indeterminate       tomato on either side.</li>
				  <li>Utilize ridges, which separate       individual plots for growing root and tuber crops.</li>
				  <li>As intensive and continuous       cropping is done in a kitchen garden, fertility and texture of soil may be       maintained by applying adequate quantities of organic manure       frequently.  Organic farming should       be given thrust for a kitchen or home garden.  However, in order to harvest good crop,       chemical fertilizers are also essential.</li>
				  <li>Since fresh vegetables are       directly utilized, follow clean cultivation, mechanical removal of pest /       disease affected plants, planting of resistant varieties, biological       control, use of bio-pesticides or bio-fungicides for pest and disease       control in a kitchen garden.</li>
				  <li>In a kitchen garden, preference       should be given to long duration and steady yielding varieties than high       yielding ones, which require constant care.</li>
				  <li>Crop arrangement : While       allotting or arranging crops in each sub-plot, care should be taken to       plant varieties / crops at ideal time of planting or season.  Principles of crop rotation also should       be followed in continuous cropping.</li>
				  <li>A bee-hive may be provided for       ensuring adequate pollination of crops besides obtaining honey.</li>
				  <li>A cropping pattern for a model       kitchen garden in the warm humid tropical condition of Kerala is furnished       below.  However, choice of the crop       depends on the likes and dislikes of family members.</li>

				<p><strong>Market garden</strong><br />
				  Market gardens are established  within 15-20 km of city to supply fresh vegetables to nearby local market.  Cropping pattern in a market garden depends  on demands of local market.  Mostly high  value crops, early varieties and varieties or crops which do not stand long  distance transport (amaranth, yard long bean, bitter gourd etc.) are grown on  an extensive manner in market garden.   High cost of land and labour is compensated by high price of produce,  low transport cost and availability of municipal compost.  Due to increasing cost and pressure on land  near big cities and fast developing transportation facilities, market vegetable  gardens in big cities are on verge of extinction.</p>
				<p><strong>Truck garden</strong><br />
				  Truck gardens are usually  established in rural areas for supplying a few vegetable crops to a distant  market.  Here cultivation of a few  specialized crops is done on an extensive scale in large area under ideal soil and  climatic conditions.  Relatively cheap  labour and land, mechanical cultivation and high yield result in low production  cost in a truck garden.  However,  involvement of middlemen in marketing and cost of transportation reduce net  income.<br />
  <strong>Vegetable garden for processing</strong><br />
				  Vegetables like tomato, peas,  potato, sprouting broccoli, spinach, lima bean, gherkin and onion are utilized  by processing industries for canning, dehydration, freezing, pickling and for  making other processed products in developed countries.  For regular supply of specialized varieties  and crops to processing industries, vegetable gardens are established near  processing factories.  In India, this  type of gardens is found in Punjab and a few other states for supplying tomato  for processing industries.  Varieties  meeting processing requirements only are cultivated here and supply of seeds  for sowing, cultivation practices and supply of vegetables to processing  industry are mostly based on some agreement between factory owners and farmers.<br />
  <strong>Vegetable garden for seed production</strong><br />
				  Annual seed requirement of major  vegetables in India is around 51,000 tonnes.   Major share of requirement is met with home saved seeds of farmers.  With advancement of technologies, especially  development of improved varieties and hybrids, seed production has become a  specialized job requiring great expertise.<br />
				  Vegetables for seed production are  grown in idea soil, climate and disease-free conditions.  Each crop / variety is grown in specified  isolation distance meeting all the field and crop standards.  Timely inspection and rouging are also done  to maintain seed purity.  Handling of  seed crop curing, threshing, cleaning, package and storage are specialized jobs  requiring thorough knowledge.  Since  pests and diseases affect seed field more than that of vegetable field, timely  crop protection measures are to be taken, especially for control of seed borne  diseases.<br />
  <strong>Special Systems of Vegetable Farming</strong><br />
				  Vegetables are cultivated during  specific seasons in areas where soil and climatic conditions are ideal and  water is available in plenty.  It is also  grown as rainfed crop depending on receipt of rain.  Specific regions and villages scattered  throughout the country are famous for cultivation of specific vegetables.  To meet increasing demand of vegetables  cultivation is also undertaken in adverse climatic conditions by adjusting time  of planting or creating favourable situations for growth of plants under  natural conditions or by constructing temporary or permanent structures.<br />
				  Special systems of cultivation  followed in India are :</p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Cultivation in protected       structures like glass houses, poly houses, rain shelters etc.</li>
				  <li>Hydroponics</li>
				  <li>Floating type of cultivation</li>
				  <li>River bed cultivation</li>
				  <li>Organic farming</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Cultivation in protected structures</strong><br />
				  In developed countries, vegetables  are grown under protected structures like green houses to tide over  unfavourable weather conditions like extremely low temperature, snow fall  during winter and frequent rains during summer.   Green houses are framed or inflated structures covered with transparent  or translucent materials, large enough to grow crops under partial or fully  controlled environmental conditions, to get optimum growth and  productivity.  They allow solar radiation  to pass through it but traps the long wave thermal radiation emitted from  inside and increases inside-temperature by 10-12oC. This “green  house effect” helps for vegetable forcing in cold climate.  Evaporation from soil and plants also raise  humidity inside.  Carbon dioxide released  by plants inside increases rate of photosynthesis during daytime.  Optimum CO2 concentration in a  green house atmosphere is between 700-900 ppm.   CO2 enrichment to 1200 ppm increases photosynthesis Hence, CO2  is supplemented in green house through natural CO2 generators kept  in green house or directed through pipes or by use of liquid CO2.<br />
				  A comparison of productivity of  different vegetables under open and green house conditions furnished in ‘table  1 is self-explanatory.  In addition to  manifold increase in productivity, green house cultivation also results in long  fruiting span, high quality and less incidence of pests and diseases.<br />

				<p>            Depending on cladding material used,  the structures are called as glass houses or poly houses.<br />
                    <strong>Glass house</strong><br />
				  Roof and all the four sides of glass  houses are covered with glass sheets.   Green house effect increases temperature inside glass houses.  Most of the glass houses are provided with  heating systems.  During summer, cooling  devices are also provided.  Temperature,  humidity, light and carbon dioxide are also controlled through computerized  micro processor system for providing ideal conditions.  CO2 enrichment is done inside the  glass house for increasing yield.  High  value and highly productive crops like tomato, capsicum, cucumber, musk melon,  water melon and spinach are grown in high-tech glass houses in developed  countries like USA, UK, West Germany USSR, Japan, Spain, Italy, Rumania,  Bulgaria etc.  Trailing cucurbits like  cucumber and muskmelon are pruned to encourage vertical growth and are trained  to different systems like arch way system, inclined cordon system or vertical  cordon system.  In tomato, mostly  indeterminate F1 hybrids are trained to vertical poles.  Plants are fed with optimum amount of  nutrients through drip irrigation and foliar spray.  The high initial outlay for erection of glass  houses and for providing glass house environment is compensated by long  duration, prolonged harvesting periods, high yield and good quality.<br />
  <strong>Poly-house</strong><br />
				  Recent advancements in  petrochemicals and plastics led to replacement of costly glass houses to less  costlier poly-houses for growing vegetables.   In developed countries like Japan, Spain, Italy, Holland, Israel and UK  poly-houses are utilized for commercial production of vegetables under adverse  climatic conditions.  In Japan, 84% of  area under poly-houses is utilized for vegetable cultivation.  In India, poly-house technique has made it  possible to cultivate crops like cabbage, cauliflower, knol khol, tomato,  onion, spinach and fenugreek throughout the year.  Due to encouragement by the Government, area  under poly-houses in India was increased from a mere 5 ha in 1983 to more than  2000 ha. during 2006.  Poly-houses in the  country are mostly located in Bangalore, Pune, Delhi, Hyderabad and  Uttaranchal.  At present, poly-houses are  mainly utilized for nursery raising of vegetable crops, hybrid seed production  and off-season cultivation of high value vegetable crops like tomato, capsicum  and cucumber in metropolitan cities.<br />
				  Poly-houses are large structures  made of aluminium or galvanized iron or locally available wooden materials  using ultraviolet stabilized low density polythene or transparent plastic film  as cladding materials for growing plants under controlled or partially  controlled environment.  Based on climate  control devices and materials used, poly-houses are classified into low cost,  medium cost and high cost poly-houses.<br />
  <strong>Low cost poly-house</strong><br />
				  Low cost poly-houses are not  provided with any climate control device.   This is a zero-energy chamber made of 700 gauge polythene sheet  supported on bamboo or locally available materials.  During winter of mild sub-tropics poly-houses  are completely closed at night and as a result temperature inside would be 5-10oC  more than outside.  During daytime,  poly-houses are kept open to allow natural ventilation.  During summer, temperature inside the  poly-houses are reduced by providing shade nets, frequent watering and by  opening the walls.<br />
  <strong>Medium cost poly-house</strong><br />
				  In medium cost poly-houses, all four  sides are completely covered and temperature inside is controlled by  providing.  “Fan and pad cooling system”,  shade nets and micro-sprinklers.  During  winter, hot air blowers are necessary to maintain higher temperature.  It has a single layer covering of ultraviolet  stabilized polythene of 800 gauge thickness on G1 pipes of 15 mm bore.<br />
  <strong>High cost poly-houses</strong><br />
				  It is provided with fibreglass  covering with full climate control devices.   Temperature, humidity, light, day length and winds are automatically  controlled using computers.  Sensors and  data loggers are provided in glass house to detect variation and to record  climatic factors.  High-tech structures  are also provided with fully automatic fertigation system, sprinklers, misting  system and fumigation devices.<br />
				  Approximate cost estimated for one  square meter in low, medium and high cost structures were Rs.125-500,  Rs.500-1,000 and Rs.1,000 and above respectively.  However, due to escalation in prices of  component parts cost of various structures were increased considerably.<br />
				  Depending on shape of roof, poly  houses are of Lean type, Even-span or Gable type, Uneven span type, Ridges and  furrows type, Saw-tooth type or Quonset type. <br />
				  Poly-houses are mostly of Quonset  types in which roof is semi-round.  Pipe  arches or trusses are supported by pipe pure lines running along green houses  and are covered by UV stabilized polyethylene sheets.  The ideal size of a structure is 30-37.5 m in  length, 9.0 m width, 2.5 m and 3.5-4.5 m height at the sides and  centre</p>
				<p>          Even-span type is with roof slopes of  equal width slanting uniformly to either side.   This is mostly constructed at level lands and its height is 2.5-2.75 m  at sides and 3.75-4.25 m at centre.   Ideal size with fibre glass covering is 9 m width and 30-37.5 length. <br />

				<p><strong>Rain Shelters</strong><br />
				  This is naturally ventilated low  cost green house to protect plants from direct rain.  Rain shelters are the most suited protection  structures in high rainfall states like Assam and Kerala.  It is provided with roof claddings of UV  stabilized low density poly-ethylene film and sides are fully open.  Mostly even span structure is used for  construction of rain shelters.<br />
				  Major bottle-neck of protected  cultivation in glass / poly houses is the high initial investment. Nearly 50%  of cost in protected cultivation is for structure alone.  Maintenance cost of fully automatic  structures also will be very high.   Continuous cultivation of crops in one and same site depletes the soil  and needs replenishment frequently.   Sufficient care also should be taken to avoid incidence of pests and  diseases in protected structures.<br />
                  <strong>Trench cultivation </strong> <br />
				  Vegetable cultivation is impossible  at sub-zero winter temperature of high altitude places.  Trench cultivation, otherwise called as  underground green house technology, is a simple and economically viable  technology for growing vegetables during winter.  This technology is being utilized by farmers  of Ladak and Leh regions of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir for  extending vegetable production from three to eight months.<br />
				  For making underground green house,  a trench of 10 m length, 3.3 m width and 1.25 m depth is made.  After digging, it should be filled by fertile  surface soil up to a height of 30 cm.  To  avoid crumbling of walls, the trench can be constructed with help of stone  masonry.  Wooden poles are used to hold  polythene sheets over trench.  Vegetables  like beet leaf, spinach, vegetable mustard, fenugreek, Swiss chard, Chinese  cabbage, celery, parsley, coriander and mint are the most suited crop for  cultivation.  Crops utilize subsoil  temperature, which is higher than prevailing atmospheric temperature.<br />
                  <strong>Tunnels</strong><br />
				  Tunnel is used for initiating early  germination of different summer crops like cucurbits.  During rainy season also, a plastic tunnel  can be provided to protect mid-season varieties of cucumber raised in nursery  against rains.  Plastic tunnels are  extensively used in cold desert of Ladakh for raising vegetable nursery and to  obtain early crops.  In tunnels,  environment is made congenial for growth of plants when atmosphere is  unfavourable.  Plastic tunnels are made  using UV stabilized corrugated or plain fibre reinforced plastic sheets using  metallic wire or frames to provide support to film in tunnel shape.<br />
                  <strong>Hot beds and Cold frames</strong><br />
				  Structures like hot beds and cold  frames are used for growing vegetables in winter.  These beds provide an early start for crops  like tomato, cucumber, okra, pepper, cabbage, muskmelon and watermelon.  Hot frame can be made of wood, cement or  brick stone and is prepared above ground.   The pit is filled with a mixture of well rotten farmyard manure, ash and  soil.  Artificial heating is employed.<br />
				  Cold frames are similar to hot beds  except for absence of any form of artificial heat.  Cold frames are wooden or concrete structures  with plastic on top, which trap heat from sun, making temperature several  degrees higher.<br />
                  <strong>Hydroponics</strong> <br />
				  Hydroponics is the technique of  growing crops in soil-less media using nutrient solutions.  It provides a method of growing plants in  areas where soil is lacking or soil is present but contaminated with disease  causing organisms or toxic substances.   This technology is suited for growing high value vegetables like tomato,  capsicum, lettuce, water melon, musk melon etc.   Here roots of plants are floated in nutrient solution provided with  circulating air or bubbling air.  The  plants are kept in proper position with supports.<br />
				  The Defense Research Laboratory,  Haldwani in Uttaranchal made extensive works on hydroponics and has suggested  the following model for a hydroponics system.<br />
				  The basic components of hydroponics  are :</p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Shallow fibre glass trays /       plastic trays (60 cm length x 40 cm width x 12.5 cm depth) in which plants       are grown.</li>
				  <li>A collection tank / nutrient       solution storage tank.</li>
				  <li>A pump which circulates the       nutrient solution from reservoir to growing trays through polyethylene       tubes.</li>
				  <li>A sequential timer to control       operation of pump.</li>
				  <li>An aerator connected to reservoir       through polyethylene tube, to aerate nutrient solution to maintain oxygen       level in nutrient solution.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Seedlings  are planted on trays covered with thermocol sheets which provide support to  young plants and keep roots of plants and nutrient solution in darkness.  A uniform slope is maintained in trays for  free flow of nutrient solutions and to avoid water stagnation in trays.  For proper growth, plants must be supplied  with all nutrients.  To prepare nutrient  solution, various fertilizers are mixed in a particular proportion and  dissolved in water as per the following   table.<br />

  <strong>Cultivation of vegetables in floating  bases in lakes</strong><br />
				  In Dal lakes of Kashmir, vegetables  are cultivated in floating bases made up of roots of Typha grass growing wild  in the lakes.  The base is first prepared  by weaving of roots of Typha grass.  Then  fertile soil rich in humus is placed on the grass base and seeds are sown.  All the intercultural operations including  watering are done with the help of boats.   The floating garden can be dragged to different places for specific  purposes.  Most of the summer vegetables  supplied to Srinagar are from these floating gardens.<br />
  <strong>Cultivation of vegetables in river bed</strong><br />
				  Growing of cucurbits in river beds  or river basins constitute a distinct type of farming.  These areas are called “diara lands” in UP  and Bihar.  In river beds of Jamuna,  Ganga, Goamti, Sarayu and other tributaries in Haryana, UP and Bihar and other  rivers in the remaining states, cucurbits like bottle gourd, ash gourd, parval,  pumpkin and melona are commonly grown.   It is a type of vegetable forcing during winter from November-February  in North India.  In Kerala, fertile  basins of rivers Pamba and Manimala are utilized for growing crops like yard  long bean, bitter gourd and snake gourd.   Cucurbits like ash gourd, pumpkin, bottle gourd and water melon are  cultivated during summer season in river beds of Bharathapuzha in Kerala.<br />
				  River beds are formed by alluvian  and diluvian action of rivers and due to inundation caused by swollen river  during South West monsoon.  Fresh silt  and clay deposited every year during monsoon months make the land suitable, for  growing vegetables literally on sand.   Even though upper layer of sand seems unsuitable for cultivation,  subterranean moisture seeped from adjacent river streams, makes it possible to  grow early crops.  Cucurbits are adapted  to this situation due to long tap root system.<br />
				  The system consists of  identification of areas where there is silt deposit and water level is around  2.0 m below.  After identifying the  areas, trenches at 2.0-3.0 m spacing or pits at 4.0 m distance are dug after  cessation of South West monsoon, late in October.  Making pits in sand is a skilled work.  Individual pits of 1.0 m diameter are taken  to a depth of 1.0-1.5 m.  After removing  top layer of sand, lower silt is dug and raised almost ¾ height of the  pit.  Finally it takes the shape of a  pillar inside the pit surrounded by sand on all sides.  A handful of assorted seeds are sown on this  silt.  Most cucurbits are grown in  November-December.  Before sowing,  trenches are manured with farmyard manure / cakes or other decomposed  wastes.  Since winter temperature in  North India falls down to 1-2oC, protection is done by planting grass stubbles  (<em>Saccharum</em> spp.).  It has the following uses :</p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Checks sand drifting on the dug       up trenches and covering the hills sown with seeds.</li>
				  <li>Provides partial protection from       chilling winds.</li>
				  <li>The grass is available for       spreading over the sand when the vines grow and cover the sand.</li>
				  <li>Prevent the sand being blown off       with vines, especially when too hot summer winds sweep the areas in May.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Due  to prevalent low temperature, sprouted seeds are sown in trenches / pits during  November – December and mixed cropping of several cucurbits like musk melon,  water melon, pumpkin, bottle gourd, ridge and smooth gourds are practiced.  Sometimes seedlings get covered with drifting  sand due to wind.  This has to be exposed  from sand in all days.  In Bihar pointed  gourd (parval) is also grown wherein the rooted cuttings are planted.  Plants are pot watered initially until the  roots touch the water regime down below.<br />
				  Channel  irrigation starts when plant start vining.   Small ponds or wells are dug in river and water is drawn using picota or  by using kerosene or diesel engines.  For  preventing seepage of water, mud is mixed with water in main channel.  This mud plasters the channel through which  water flows to pits without much seepage loss.   Irrigation is done once in 2 or 4 days.   In some parts, young seedlings are also transplanted.  Since the silt soil is rich in humus, carried  from the forests, fertilizer application was not essential during earlier  periods.  Due to depletion of soil  fertility, fertilizer application has become necessary in several sites and the  top dressing is done twice, 20-25 days after sowing and alter.  Fertilizers are applied away from the plants  in shallow side trenches.  When it starts  vining, trenches are leveled, stubbles are spread in the inter-spaces for  spreading plants on sand.  In years of  un-seasonal rainfall or floods in river, the crops may get lost and re-sowing  has to be done.River bed system is developed through native ingenuity of  farmers.  The home saved seeds are used  for cultivation.  Yield is variable,  depending on location.  Since only a  single crop is taken in a year, pest and disease incidence is comparatively less  in river bed system of cultivation.<br />
  <strong>Organic farming</strong><br />
				  The basic principles to be followed  in organic farming are:</p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Cultivate crops in the ideal       cropping season: The ideal time of sowing for each vegetable crop is       standardized for different agro-climatic zones.  However, minor alterations are to be       made to suit to specific localities.</li>
				  <li>Avoid off-season cultivation of       vegetables in traditional growing areas since it may result in heavy       incidence of pests and diseases.</li>
				  <li>Cultivate varieties already       acclimatized in the locality.        Priority should be given to medium yielding varieties tolerant to       pests and diseases rather than high yielding varieties.</li>
				  <li>Select pest and diseases       resistant varieties in areas and seasons when severe incidence of pests or       diseases are expected.</li>
				  <li>Follow scientific crop rotation       practices regularly in vegetable cultivation.</li>
				  <li>Raise a leguminous crop and       plough back to soil at its pre flowering stage before cultivating a heavy       feeding vegetable crop in particular site.</li>
				  <li>Practice shifting type of       cultivation and keep land fallow at least one season in a year.</li>
				  <li>Plough back all the crop residues       to the soil whenever a crop is over.</li>
				  <li>Practice composting regularly for       converting biodegradable wastes to organic manures.  Fungi like <em>Pleurotus</em> sp., and earthworms (<em>Eudrillus eugineae</em>) can be effectively utilized for making       compost at a faster rate and for making it nutrient rich.</li>
				  <li>Locally available organic       materials like farmyard manure, poultry manure, goat manure, green leaves,       organic cakes, fish meal, bone meal, etc. may be given priority for use in       the organic farming.  Apply farmyard       manure or compost as basal dose and organic concentrates like organic       cakes, poultry manure, vermin-compost etc. as top dressing.</li>
				  <li>Use weeds as mulches or cover it       with soil for converting to organic matter.</li>
				  <li>In organic farming, native       strains of bio-fertilizers like <em>Rhizobium</em>,  <em>Azotobacter,</em> blue green algae, azolla, phosphate solubilizing bacteria and fungi,       mycorrhizal fungi, etc. may be utilized for fixing nitrogen and increasing       availability of phosphorus to plants.        The enzymes and hormones produced by microorganisms also impart       favourable effects on growth and productivity of crops.</li>
				  <li>Burning pits before sowing or       practice solarisation to control soil borne pests and diseases.</li>
				  <li>Remove alternate hosts of pests       and diseases and follow eco-friendly pests and disease control measures       like cutting and removal of pests and diseased plants or plant parts, trap       cropping, use of colour, sticky and other traps for attracting and killing       insects.</li>
				  <li>Promote biological control of       pests and diseases by promoting parasites and predators.</li>
				  <li>Home made insecticides like neem       oil – garlic mixture, neem kernel suspension, tobacco decoction, etc. have       wide use for control of pests and diseases in organic farming of       vegetables.  Plants like <em>Andrographis</em> sp.,  <em>Clerodendron</em>, <em>Eucalyptus</em> etc. also have values       in pest control.</li>
				  <li>Micro       organisms like viruses, fungi, bacteria etc. Are currently utilized in pest       control under organic farming.        Nuclear polyhedrosis viruses (NPV) for control of <em>Heliothis armigera</em>, bacteria like <em>Pseudomonas fluorescens</em> against       diseases incited by <em>Phytophthora,       Pythium, Rhizoctonia, Fusarium, Colletotrichum, Rolstonia,</em> and <em>Xanthomonas; Bacillus thuringiensis</em> for control of insect pests <em>Plutella </em>sp., <em>Heliocoverpa </em>sp., <em>Earias</em> sp. etc.; fungi like <em>Fusarium pallidoroseum</em> for control       of aphids are useful in organic farming.        Fungal antagonists like <em>Trichoderma </em>sp.
