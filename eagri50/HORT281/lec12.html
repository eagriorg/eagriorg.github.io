  <strong>Origin  and History </strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Cabbage originated from a wild non  heading type, ‘Cole wart’ (<em>Brassica oleracea</em> <em>var. sylvestris</em>).  The genus Brassica includes about 100  species, majorities of which are native to the Mediterranean region.  The crop is attributed to Mediterranean  centre of origin.  It is also considered  that the real headed cabbage was evolved in Germany.  The Savoy cabbage originated in Italy and  spread to France and Germany in the sixteenth and seventh centuries.  At present, cabbage is grown in Caribbean  countries, Indonesia, Malaysia, Central East and West America.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

          <p><strong> </strong><strong>Nutritive  Value and Uses</strong><br />
                    <strong>             </strong>Cabbage  leaves are low in calories (27 per cent), fat (0.1 per cent) and carbohydrates  (4.6 per cent).  It is good sources of  protein (1.3 per cent) which contains all essential amino acids, particularly  sulphur containing amino acids.  Cabbage  proteins are comparable to pea proteins, in biological value, digestibility and  NPU. Cabbage is an excellent source of minerals such as calcium (39 mg), iron  (0.8 mg), magnesium (10 mg), sodium (14.1 mg), potassium (114 mg) and  phosphorus (44 mg).  It has substantial  amounts of β carotene provitamin A), ascorbic acid, riboflavin, niacin and  thiamine.  Ascorbic acid content varies  from 30-65 mg per 100 g fresh weight.   Cooking or shredding of cabbage and leaving it exposed to air can result  in substantial loss of ascorbic acid.   Red cabbage is a rich source of anthocyanin pigments.  Both mono and diacylated cyanidin derivatives  have been identified in red cabbage.   Cabbage contains thermo labile sulphur compounds, which evolve sulfurous  odours.  The major volatile sulfur compounds  (dimethyl disulfide and hydrogen sulfide) of cooked cabbage are derived from a  precursor of 1, S methyl cysteine sulfoxide, a free amino acid.  The presence of 2-propenyl isothiocyanate in  both white and red cabbage and 3-butenyl isothiocynate in red cabbage has also  been reported.<br />
                  Cabbage  is used commonly as vegetables. It is also used for salad mixed in tomato,  green chilies, beetroot etc.  Flavour in  cabbage leaves is due to the glycoside sinigrin.  Cabbage contains goitrogens which cause  enlargement of thyroid glands.  The  thioglucosides with their associate enzyme (s) impart the desirable culinary  flavour to cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower.   The thioglucosides (sinigrin) are non goitrogenic which depends upon  enzymatic hydrolysis in presence of the enzyme (progoitrin and epi-goitrin) is  the precursors of an anti thyroid compound called goitrin.  The goitrin is formed subsequent to  hydrolysis and then through cyclization of an unstable isothiocyanate containing  hydroxyl group.  The total glucosinolate  content of white cabbage cultivars ranged from 299-1288 ppm, whereas the  goitrin content varied from 1.2 to 26.0 ppm.   Although the enzymatic hydrolytic products from the glucosinolates are  goitrogenic, some of these breakdown products have anticancerous  properties.  It has also been reported  that most of the goitrogen properties of cabbage could be lost during  cooking.  Cabbage is well known for its  medicinal properties.  In ayurvedic  medicine, cabbage leaves are prescribed for cough, fever, skin diseases, peptic  ulcers, urinary discharge and hemorrhoids.   Fresh cabbage juice is reported to contain a heat labile antipeptic  ulcer component.  A clinical study has  indicated that concentrated cabbage juice is significantly effective in healing  peptic ulcers.  Cabbage is one of the  best sources of a sulphur containing amino acids.  Fresh cabbage juice is reported to have anti  bacterial activity and has been shown to inhibit the growth of various strains  of lactic acid bacteria.  Cabbage is also  reported to have significant anti cancer activity.  Model studies and epidemiological data in  humans have confirmed the protective role of cabbage studies and  epidemiological data in humans have confirmed the protective role of cabbage on  the development of cancer.<br />
                    <strong>Area  and production </strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>India is the third largest cabbage producer in the  world.  It is mainly grown in the states  like Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Bihar, Assam, West Bengal, Maharashtra and  Karnataka in the country.  Area,  production and productivity from 1987-1988 to 1998-99 in India are given in  Table - 1.<br />

  <strong>Climatic  Requirements </strong> <br />
				  Cabbage  can be grown easily under a wide range of environmental conditions but cool  moist climate is most suitable.  The  optimum soil temperature for seed germination is (22-26.2oC).  The optimum temperature for growth is between  (25.2 to 34.2oC).  Whereas,  temperature above 43.2oC, growth is arrested in most of the  cultivars.  Minimum temperature for  growth of cabbage is just above 0oC.   It is reported that after cold treatment at 4 to 10oC  for 7-9 weeks, the plant bolt sooner and  flower more abundantly than when exposed to such temperatures for shorter  period but before this temperature treatment, plants must have passed juvenile  phase. (Nieuwhoff, 1969).<br />
  <strong>Soil  Conditions</strong> <br />
				  Cabbage  can be grown in wide range of sandy to heavy soils.  Early cultivars grow well in light soils,  whereas, maturing ones perform better on heavy soils.  However, well-drained soils give larger  yields.  The optimum pH of soil for  cabbage cultivation is between 6.0-6.5.   Most of the cabbage is somewhat tolerant to salt.  In saline soils, the plants show die back of  leaf margins and dark foliage and it become more susceptible to diseases like  black leg.<br />
  <strong>Sowing  Time</strong><br />
				  Seed-sowing  time varies in different parts of India.   In hills, especially, in high hills, seeds are sown in May - June for  summer / autumn crop.  In the hilly areas  which receive heavy rains, the summer and autumn crop is rather limited and  sowing is undertaken in autumn to harvest them in late spring in early summer  by over watering them.  In the plains of  northern India, sowing in situ or in seedbed starts from early August and  continue till November for the late cultivars.   In eastern India, sowing is generally started from mid to late  September.  Sowing is delayed further for  areas in the southern hills except in the western and southern peninsular,  where the crop can be grown almost round the year by selecting proper cultivars  / hybrids.<br />
  <strong>Seed  Rate, Methods of Sowing and Transplanting Distance</strong> </p>
				<p>About 200-500 g/ha seed is required.  Cabbage is a transplanted crop.  In India, the seeds are sown in a  seedbed.  In the plains, the seed beds  for early crop require cover to save the small seedlings from rains, while in  the high hills, it may be better to grow them under glass flames or poly  tunnels.  However, the seedlings of mid  season or late cultivar may be raised in the open.  The soil of nursery bed should be well  prepared and free from disease organisms.   The sieved well rotten farmyard manure or compost 2 2-3 kg/m2  must</p>
				<p>be  added in the seedbed.  Before sowing, the  seed should be treated with any one of fungicide like Thiram, Cerasan, Agrosan  or Bavistin @ 2 g/kg seeds.  The optimum  spacing between rows in the nursery bed is 10 cm and the depth of sowing should  be 1.5-2.5 cm.  For planting one hectare  200-300 m2 seedbed at the rate of 1 to 2 g per sq. m is  required.  One-gram seed would give rise  to about 1000 seedlings.  After sowing,  the seed is properly covered with a thin layer of mixture of fine manure and  soil.  The beds are leveled gently.    A regular and good moisture supply is  needed for rapid germination of seed and the optimum growth of seedlings.  To keep the upper soil of seedbed moist, a  thin layer of dry grass is spread on the beds and watering is done in the form  of shower either with watering cane or with the help of a sprinkler.  But, the seed bed cover should be removed as  soon as the emergence of young seedlings above the ground starts.  If there is over crowding of seedlings due to  thick sowing, the extra seedlings should be thinned out.  Attention should also be given for control of  diseases and insect pests in the nursery.   “Damping off” caused by different fungi <em>viz</em>. <em>Pythium spp.  Rhizoctonia spp</em>. is common and severe disease in nursery.  The spray of blitox-50 @ 0.3 per cent is  effective against this disease.<br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Generally, 4-6 weeks old seedlings are ready for  transplanting but older seedlings up to 8 weeks age can also be  transplanted.  However, older seedlings  have adverse effect on the establishment and growth of young plants.  The optimum time of transplanting varies in  different climatic conditions.  The  planting in plains of India can be done from August to December and in hills  from April to August.  Early maturing  cultivars like “Golden Acre” does well in the plains because of shorter cool  period, while, “Drum Head Late”, “Pusa Drum Head” and other late maturing  varieties performs better in hills, where, cool temperature are available for  longer duration.  However, cultivars of  all maturity groups can be grown in hills of north India by planting on  suitable altitudes at optimum time.  The  planting distance may be varying according to cultivar, planting season and  soil conditions.  The following distances  are generally recommended on the basis of maturity of cultivars <em>viz</em>.,  for early 45 x 45; cm or 60 x 30 cm, mid 60 x 45 cm and late 60 x 60 cm.  The planting is done on the flat land, ridges  or in furrows depending on climate and soil conditions.  For early planting, ridge method will be more  suitable, especially, in areas where the rain occurs at the time of  planting.  In saline soils, planting  should be done in furrows.<br />
                  <strong>Nutritional  Requirements and Their Management</strong> <br />
Manure’s  and fertilizers requirements in cabbage are depend upon fertility status of the  soil which is determined by soil testing.   However, if soil testing is not possible, then 200-250 q/ha farmyard  manure should be applied.  It should be  thoroughly mixed in the soil before 15-20 days of transplanting.  The quantity of nitrogen, phosphorous and  potash varies from place to place, as given in Table 2.<br />

				<p><strong>Water  Management</strong><br />
				  Cabbage  is very sensitive to soil moisture.   Maximum growth and yield can only be obtained when a plentiful supply of  water is available to the plants throughout the growth.  First irrigation is given just after  transplanting of seedlings and thereafter, irrigation may be done at 10-15 days  interval according to season and soil conditions.  But optimum soil moisture should be  maintained regularly.  Cabbage is usually  irrigated by furrow method of irrigation.   Excessive irrigation in early stages causes superficial rooting and  washing down of nutrients.  Heavy  irrigation should also be avoided when the heads have formed, as it will result  in splitting of heads.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting,  Yield and Storage</strong> <br />
				  The  harvesting   of cabbage is done when the  heads reach at marketable size.  The  early cultivars grown under comparatively warmer conditions develop loose head  at the initial stage, but became harder at maturity.  In some cultivars, the heads start cracking  soon after the maturity.  In such cases,  the quality of head is deteriorates fast, if harvesting is delayed.  Hence, harvesting should be done at right  stage for getting good quality head.  The  early cultivars take 60-80 days, medium 80-100 days and alter 100-130 days for  harvesting after transplanting.  The  yield of early cabbage variety ranges between 300-400 q/ha, whereas, medium and  late cabbage 400-600 q/ha in northern plain.   Cabbage can be stored at 0oC and 90-95 per cent RH for about  2 to 8 months (Mercontilia, 1989).<br />
  <strong>Diseases  and Pests</strong><br />
  <strong>Diseases</strong><br />
  <strong>Fungal  Diseases</strong><br />
  <strong>Downy  Mildew (<em>Perenospora parasitica</em>)</strong><br />
				  Plant  can be infected at any time during their growing period.  Young plants infected early show a white  mildew growth mostly on the under side of leaf.   Later, however, slight yellowing shows up the corresponding upper  surface.  The young leaf may drop  off.  Older leaves usually persist and the  infected areas enlarge as they turn tan and papery.  When the disease is severe the whole leaf  dies.<br />
  <strong>Control  Measures </strong><br />
				  It  can be controlled by spray the seedling in the nursery bed with copper  oxychloride (0.3 per cent)<br />
  <strong>Wire Stem (<em>Rhizoctonia solani</em> Kuhn)</strong><br />
				  It  may attack different stages of growth.   Young seedlings suffer the worst.   Young plants shows soft water soaked post on the skin just above the  ground.  The cotyledons wither and the  plant eventually falls over and perishes.   The fungus also causes head rot in cabbage.  The first sign of infection is a reddish  brown discoloration on the stem at the soil level.  The area is constricted and the plant may be  bent or twisted without breaking.<br />
  <strong>Control  Measures</strong><br />
				  Regulating  moisture levels, seed treatment and soil drenching with Dithane M-45 (0.2 per  cent) or Bavistin (0.1 per cent) can be used for protection against the  disease.</p>
				<p><strong>Black  Spot (<em>Alternaria brassicae</em> (Berk) Sacc.)</strong><br />
				  The  first symptom is a small dark spot on the leaf surfaces.  As the spot enlarges, concentric rings  develop.  The diseased spot enlarges  progressively and defoliate plants.  It  is a destructive disease on seed crop, affecting pods and seeds.<br />
  <strong>Control  Measures</strong><br />
				  Spray  Captan (0.2 per cent) or Copper oxychloride (0.5 per cent) for the control of  disease (Sridhar, 1982).<br />
  <strong>Cabbage  Yellow (<em>Fusarium oxysproum </em>f. sp<em> conglutinans</em> (Wollenweber)  Snyder and Hansen)</strong><br />
				  Affected  plants have a sickly dwarfed yellow appearance, lower leaves drop one by one  and growth of the plant becomes stunted.   The fungus is seed borne and can also in soil persist many years.  Disease development is promoted by warm  weather conditions.<br />
  <strong>Control  Measures</strong><br />
				  Disease  management is difficult.  Field  sanitation, crop rotation and using disease free seeds are useful for  controlling the disease up to some extent.   Since, resistant cultivars are available, it is better to use them  rather than to try other means of control.   There are two types of resistant reported.<br />
  <strong>Type  A</strong><br />
				  Single  dominant gene controls the resistance, found first in cabbage cultivars All  Head Early, Copenhagen Market, Glory of Enkhuizen (Walker and Wellman,  1928).  It is stable at different soil  temperature.  This apparently has been  derived directly from <em>B.</em> <em>oleraceae</em> var. <em>sylvestris.</em><br />
  <strong>Type  B</strong><br />
				  The  cabbage cultivar Wisconsion Hollander has this type of resistance.  Both A and B types are found in Wisconsion  All season.<br />
  <strong>Black Leg (<em>Phoma lingam</em>) (Tode ex Fr.) Desm</strong><br />
				  It  occurs in most of the regions especially in area with rainfall during the  growing period.  The fungus is carried by  the seed and hence it may occur from the early stage.  Stem of the affected plant when split  vertically, shows severe black discoloration of sap stream.  Whole root system decays from bottom  upward.  Frequently, the affected plants  fall over in the field.<br />
  <strong>Control  Measures</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>As  the main infection is through seeds, hot water treatment can be prevented</li>
				  <li>Spraying  Copper oxychloride or with Organomercuric compound and </li>
				  <li>Use  of resistant variety like Pusa Drumhead.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Bacterial  Diseases</strong><br />
                    <strong>Black  Rot of Crucifers (<em>Xanthomonas capestris </em>pv<em>. Campestris</em> (Pammel)  Dowson)</strong><br />
				  The  disease was first observed in the USA on cabbage in 1891, but the causal  bacterium was identified during 1895.  In  India, disease was first described in 1928 on cabbage from Pune, Maharastra  (Patwardhan, 1928).  The infected plant  become stunted, often one side of cotyledon turn yellow to black bend down and  drop off prematurely.  Many lower leaves  are also shed off early.  The remaining  leaves may turn yellow with blackened veins.   Development of ‘V’   shaped  chlorotic to yellow lesions take place from the leaf margin.  The vein and vein let turn black and the leaf  tissue necrotic and brittle.  Lesion  progress towards the midrib and from this systematic infection further spread  into stem and root.  Vascular tissues in  affected parts become conspicuously black, followed by internal break down of  fleshy tissue.  Black sunken spots may  develop on succulent seed stocks and siliqua.<br />

				  Considerable  reduction in disease has been observed when seeds are treated with Plantomycin  (100 ppm) (Kishan, 1981a) or Agrimycin 100 (100 ppm) (Rao and Kishan, 1986) or  Streptocyclin (100 ppm) (Shah et al., 1985) or Auromycin (1: 1000) (Trivedi and  Patel, 1972).<br />
  <strong>Spot  of Cabbage (<em>Pseudomonas cichorii</em> (Swingle) Staff)</strong><br />
				  It  was first reported from USA in 1956.  In  India, it was reported by Trivedi and Patel (1972) in 1961 from Solan.  The spots on cabbage heads are circular to  oblong, translucent, buff to brown, 7-12 mm in diameter, sunken and having  typical donations.  Lesions on the inner  leaves are irregular on outline, almost black in colour and localized near the  margin of young leaves.  The vascular  bundles of stem become dark brown.  Elongated  and sunken lesion, 5-7 cm in size also develops on petiole and mid ribs of the  lower leaves.<br />
  <strong>Control  Measures</strong><br />
				  As in  black rot of cabbage.<br />
  <strong>Club  Root (<em>Plasmodiophora brassicae</em> War.)</strong><br />
				  This  is a typical root parasite.  Club root is  particularly prevalent in soils with a pH above 7.  Once affected, it causes irregular galls on  the roots and these on the lateral roots take the shape of spindle.  Leaves become yellowish and wilt.<br />
  <strong>Control  Measures</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>At  the planting time, 250 ml of 0.05 to 0.10 per cent solution of mercuric  chloride may be applied for direct control. </li>
				  <li>Roots  are treated with 4 per cent calomel paste before transplanting and </li>

                <ol>
                  <li>Most  of the insecticides recommended for diamond back moth control are also  effective against leaf Webber.</li>
                  <li>In  biological control, major natural mortality factors for leaf webber was  recorded parasitization by <em>Bracon hebetor</em> Say and <em>Palexorusta  solennis</em> (Wlk) in the late larval   instars (Singh, 1978).</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Mustard  Sawfly (<em>Althalia lugens proxima</em> Klug)</strong><br />
                  The  blackish caterpillar that attacks all Cole crops and feed on leaves of young  seedling in the early stages.  The  infested leaves become curl and falls on the ground when touched.<br />
  <strong>Control  Measures </strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>If  low infestation and number of attacked plants are few, hand picking of  caterpillar, is the best method of controlling the larvae. </li>
                  <li>Dusting  the plants with sevin @ 20-25 kg per hectare or spraying the same @ 5 g per  litre of water is also effective to control this insect.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Mustard  Aphids (<em>Lipaphis erysimi </em>Kalt)</strong><br />
                  This  is a greenish white small insect that attacks cabbage and other cole crops,  when there is a cloudy weather.  They  suck the sap from the plants.  The  affected leaves get curled and plants wither and die.<br />
  <strong>Control  Measures</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Aphid  can effectively be controlled by spraying the crop with any one of the  insecticides like Methyl Dematon (Metasystox-25 EC, Hexasystox-35 EC, etc.) or  Dimethoate (Rogar 30 EC, Methoate 30 EC, Sumidon, Demidon, etc. @ 1 ml per  litre of water or Phosphomidon (Demacron 100 EC, Sumidon, Demidon, etc.) @ 0.5  ml per litre of water, starting just after the germination of seed and  subsequently at an interval of 15 days.</li>
                  <li>Soil  application of Phorate 10 G @ 15 kg/ha or Thimmet 10 G @ 12 kg per hectare in  two doses i.e., half at the time of planting and other half at the time of  earthing up has also been effective against aphids.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Diamond  Back Moth (<em>Plutella xylostella</em> L.) </strong> <br />
                  In  India, it was first recorded in 1914 (Fletcher, 1914) on cruciferous  vegetables.  A small slender pale green  caterpillar that feeds on leaves and makes holes in them.  The infested crop becomes unsuitable for  marketing.</p>
                <p><strong>Control  Measures</strong><br />
The  pest can be control by (i) Foliar spray twice or thrice Cypermethrin (0.2 kg  a.i.) or Femvalerate (0.1 kg a.i. /ha) or Sulprofos (1.0 kg a.i./ha) or  Prothiophos (0.75 kg a.i./ha). (ii) Under All India Co-coordinated Vegetable  Improvement Projects on control of diamond back moth (DBM) results revealed  that against DBM and leaf Webber, three sprays of Femvalerate @ 50g.a.i./ha has  found to give maximum cost benefit ratio at IIHR, Bangalore (Anon, 2000).  The use of mustard as trap crop proved quite  effective in controlling diamond back moth incidence.  Hence, this practice has been recommended to  control diamond back moth throughout India.   Mustard crop should be sown 15 days before cabbage planting.  Two to three sprays of Dichlorphos @ 1 kg a.i./ha  in mustard and two sprays of Cartap hydrochloride @ 500 g.a.i./ha or 5 per cent  neem seed kernel extract in cabbage, starting from primordial stage of the crop  at 15 days interval has been recommended.<br />
<strong>Cabbage Borer (<em>Hellula undalis</em> F.) </strong><br />
A  white brown caterpillar that mines the leaves and feed on shoots.  Later, it burrows into the stem of  cabbage.  The affected plants wilt,  remain dwarf or may even die.<br />
<strong>Control  Measures</strong><br />
Chemicals  recommended for diamond back moth and leaf Webber control are also effective  for cabbage borer.<br />
<strong>Cabbage  Butter Fly (<em>Pieris brassicae</em> Linn.)</strong><br />
The  maggots first attack the young rootlets and then burrow into the main  roots.  The affected plants become  yellow, wilt and sometimes they may die.<br />
<strong>Control  Measures </strong><br />
Sprays  of 0.15 per cent Carbaryl and 0.4 per cent fungicide give adequate   control of the pest (Atwal and Singh, 1969).<br />
<strong>Painted  Bug (<em>Bagada crucifer</em> arum Kirk.)</strong><br />
The  adult and nymph of this pest suck the sap from the plants and retard their  normal growth.<br />

<strong>Seed  Production and Seed Certification Standards</strong><br />
<strong>Seed  Production</strong><br />
<strong>Climatic  Requirements</strong><br />
Cabbage  thrives in a relatively cool, moist climate with moderate rainfall, well  distributed during the growing season.   It can withstand frost in the head stage.  It requires a dormant period of cool  temperature to bolt and initiate seed stalks and flower.  Cool temperatures, however, are effective  only after stem diameter, is one cm at least.   In temperate climates, this occurs during the winter after the first  season growth.  Flowering and seed  production follow in the second year.   Headed plants form seed stalks when exposed to mean temperature of about  5oC for six to eight weeks.   In India, seed production of cabbage is possible only in hilly areas.<br />
<strong>Land  Requirements</strong><br />
Land  to be used for seed production of cabbage should be free from volunteer plants.<br />
<strong>Methods  of Seed Production</strong><br />
Being  a biennial, cabbage requires two seasons to produce seed.  In the first season, the heads are produced  and in the following seasons seed production follows.  The seed crop can be left in situ or  transplanted during autumn.  In situ  method is usually followed for certified seed production and the later for  nucleus seed production.<br />
            <em>In situ</em> method, the crop is  allowed to over winter and produce seed in their original position, i.e. where  they are first planted in the seedling stage.   In the transplanting method, the mature plants are uprooted.  After removing whorls, the plants are  immediately reset in a well prepared new fields in such a way that he whole  stem below the head goes underground with the head resting just above their  surface.<br />
            There are three methods to produce  seed of cabbage.<br />
<strong>Stump  Method</strong><br />
In  this method, when the crop in the first season is fully mature, the heads are  examined for true to type.  The plants  with off type heads are removed.  Then  heads are cut just below the base by means of a sharp knife, keeping the stem  with outer whorl of leaves intact.  The  beheaded portion of the plant is called “stump”.  The heads are marketed and the stumps either  are leaf in situ replanted in the second season i.e. during autumn.  The following spring, after the dormancy is  broken, the bud sprout forms the axils of all the leaves and leaf scars.<br />
<strong>Advantages</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Gives  extra income by way of sale of heads. </li>
                  <li>The  crop matures 12-15 days earlier than the head intact method and </li>
                  <li>Seed  yield is slightly increased.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Disadvantages</strong><br />
                  In this method, flowering shoots are  decumbent and require very heavy staking otherwise they breakdown very easily  while interculturing or spraying.<br />
  <strong>Stump  with Central Core Method</strong><br />
                  In  this method, when the crop is fully mature in the first season, the heads are  examined for true to type.  Plants with  off type heads are removed and rejected.   Then the heads are chopped on all sides with downward perpendicular cuts  in such a way that the central core is not damaged.  This is an improvement over stump method in  that the shoots arising from the main system are not decumbent.  During the last week of February and until 15th  March, when the heads start bursting, two vertical cross cuts are given to the  head.  Taking care that the central  growing point is not injured.  In the  absence of such cuts, the heads burst out irregularly and sometimes the growing  tip is broken.  The operation is  completed by going around the field twice or thrice during this period.<br />
  <strong>Advantages</strong><br />
                  (i)  Shoots arising from the main stem are not decumbent, hence very heavy staking  is not required and (ii) Seed yield is increased.<br />
  <strong>Disadvantages</strong><br />
                  The  chopped heads cannot be marketed.<br />
  <strong>Head  Intact Method</strong><br />
                  In  this method, when the crop is fully mature in the first season, the heads are  examined for true to type.  The plants  with off type heads are removed from the field.   The head is kept intact and only a cross cut is given to facilitate the  emergence of a stalk.<br />
  <strong>Advantages</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>The  removal for heads (stump method) or chopping of heads on all sides (central  core intact method) is not required.   This saves time and labour.</li>
                  <li>Very  heavy staking is not required.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Disadvantages</strong><br />
                  The seed yield is slightly low as  compared to stump, or stump with central core intact method.<br />
  <strong>Brief  Cultural Practices (<em>in situ</em> Method)</strong><br />
  <strong>Time  of Sowing and Transplanting</strong><br />
                  The  sowing time of different varieties should be so adjusted as to complete head formation  by the end of October or first week of November, at that time, the mean  temperature falls to 10oC or below, at this temperature, the heads  stand best for over wintering.  Early  varieties like ‘Golden Acre’ should be sown from 10th to 25th  July and transplanted when the seedlings are three to four week old, during the  second fortnight of August.  This sowing  time must be strictly adhered to, as the crop from the early sowings has  matured head during September (20oC).  The heads get infected with bacterial stock  rot, which sometimes is very severe.  The  late crop, planted during September does not form heads and bolts directly  during spring and the seed grower is not able to ascertain purity of the crop.  Medium late varieties like Bruppe’s Sure  Head, and alter varieties like Drum Head, which takes about 2 to 3 months to  produce mature heads, should be sown during the second and first fortnight of  June, respectively and transplanting finished by the first week of August.  The mean temperature 22.5oC, 20oC  and 14oC of August, September and October, respectively, afford  optimum requirements for growth and head formation. The later transplanted crop  starts head formation during spring and continues up to June and usually does  not produce seed stalks.<br />
  <strong>Method  of Nursery Sowing</strong><br />
                  The  seeds are sown in raised nursery beds in a manner as described earlier in  commercial production of cabbage.<br />
  <strong>Source  of Seed and Seed Rate</strong><br />
                  Obtain  nucleus / breeder’s / foundation seed from source approved by a seed  certification agency.  For main season  and alter varieties, 375 to 400 g seeds/ha and early varieties, 600-700 g  seeds/ha.<br />
  <strong>Preparation  of Land for Transplanting</strong><br />
                  Prepare  the land to a fine tilth by repeated ploughing and harrowing followed by  leveling.<br />
  <strong>Manure  and Fertilizers</strong><br />
                  Cabbage  grows satisfactorily only when the supply of organic mater is liberal.  For good crop, apply 500 to 600 quintal of  farmyard manure per hectare at the time of land preparation.  Apply 100 kg/ha I nitrogen, 60 kg/ha  phosphorus and 60 kg/ha of potash by drilling, or by broadcasting, sufficiently  before transplanting the seedlings.  Give  another dose of 50 kg/ha nitrogen as surface application at the time of seed  stalk emergence during March.  Extra  application of nitrogen may be given as and when there is a need before  flowering starts, depending upon the condition of the crop.<br />
  <strong>Transplanting</strong><br />
                  Three  to four week old seedlings are transplanted.   Transplanting should preferably be done in the evening and the field  irrigated immediately afterwards.<br />
  <strong>Spacing</strong><br />
                  Late  varieties - 60 x 60 cm; Medium varieties 60 x 45 cm; Early varieties 45 x 45  cm.<br />
  <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
                  Cabbage  requires a continuous supply of moisture.   Irrigate the crop as frequently as required.  Heavy irrigation should, however, be avoided  when the heads have formed.  A sudden  heavy irrigation after a dry spell may cause bursting of heads.<br />
  <strong>Hoeing  and Weeding</strong><br />
                  At  least three weddings and hoeing till the end of October are essential.  One weeding and earthling up during November  and December and the second during March when seed stalks have emerged, control  weeds and also help in proper drainage during winter and thereafter.<br />
  <strong>Staking</strong><br />
                  After  the flower stalk are sufficiently developed, staking is necessary to keep the  plants in an upright position.<br />
  <strong>Handling  the mature head</strong><br />
                  After  the planted crop has fully developed heads at the close of autumn, the next  step is the handling of these plants for seed production.  Handling of plants can be done by any one of  the three methods i.e. stump, stump with central core intact methods, described  earlier.<strong></strong><br />
  <strong>Rouging</strong><br />
                  The  first rouging is done at the time of handling of the mature heads.  All off type plants, diseased, or otherwise  undesirable types, are removed at this stage.   The second rouging is done before the heads start bursting.  The loose leafed, poorly heading plants and  those having a long stem with heavy frame must be rouged out at his stage.  It is highly undesirable to keep such poor  plants in the seed plots.  Subsequent  rouging for off types, diseased plants affected by, black leg, soft rot or leaf  spot should be done from time to time as required.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting  and Threshing</strong><br />
                  Cabbage  starts seed stalk elongation from 10-20th March when the mean  temperature rises to 10-13oC.   Flowering and pod formation starts during the first week of April at  mean temperature of 13-18.5oC.   From 15th April to 15th May, the crop is in full  flush of flowering and fruiting.  The  ripening of pods commences by 15th June to 20th   June and the harvesting continues up to  second week of July.  At mean temperatures  below 20oC during June and July, the maturity of crop is delayed at  least by a fortnight and the harvesting may continue up to July end.  To avoid shattering of seeds, the whole crop  is harvested in two or three lots with sickles.   Generally, the early plants are harvested first, and when the pod colour  is about 60-70 per cent of the rest of the crop changes to yellowish brown, it  is harvested completely and piled up for curing.  After 4-5 days, it is then threshed with  sticks and sifted with hand    sifters.  After thoroughly drying,  seeds are cleaned and stored.<br />
                <strong>Seed yield: </strong>500-600 kg per hectare.</p>
