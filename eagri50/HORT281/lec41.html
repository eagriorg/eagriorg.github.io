				<br />
                  <strong>Scientific Name &nbsp;:</strong> <em>Polianthes tuberosa</em> L. <br />
                  <strong>Family&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;: </strong>Amaryllidaceae<br />
                  <strong>Common Name &nbsp;:</strong> Tuberose<br />
                  <strong>Hindi  Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :</strong> Rajanigandha <br />
                  <strong>Origin and History </strong><br />
Tuberose is a native of  Mexico from where it spread to the different parts of the world during 16th  Century. It is believed that tuberose was brought to India via Europe in 16th century. <br />
<strong>Uses/Medicinal</strong><br />
            They  are use<img width="228" height="292" src="lec41_clip_image002.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="http://www.countryliving.com/cm/countryliving/images/CLX060109_073_1_5-de-38189031.jpg" />d for making artistic garlands, floral ornaments, bouquets and  buttonholes. The long flower spikes are excellent as cut flowers for table  decoration. The flowers emit a delightful fragrance and are the source of  tuberose oil which is used in high value perfumes and cosmetic products.  Furthermore, fragrant flowers are added along with stimulants or sedatives to  the favourite beverage prepared from chocolate and served either cold or hot as  desired. The bulbs are reported to contain an alkaloid lycorine, which causes  vomiting. The bulbs are rubbed with turmeric and butter and applied as a paste  over red pimples of infants. Dried tuberose bulbs in the powdered form are used  as a remedy for gonorrhoea. In Java, the flowers are eaten along with the  juices of the vegetables.<br />
<strong>Area and Distribution</strong><br />
            Tuberose  is cultivated in large scale in France, South Africa, North Carolina, USA and  in many tropical and subtropical areas including India. In India, the  commercial cultivation of tuberose is done mainly in Mysore, Devanhalli taluk  (Karnataka), East Godavari, Guntur, Chitoor, Krishna, Distt. (Andhra Pradesh),  Coimbatore and Madurai (Tamil Nadu), Pune, Thane, Sangli (Maharashtra), Bagnen,  Kolaghat, Midnapore, Panskura, Ranaghat, Krishnanagar (West Bengal). At present  the total area under tuberose cultivation in the country is estimated to be  about 3,000 hectare.<br />
<strong>Botanical Description </strong><br />
            Tuberose  is half-hardy, perennial, bulbous plant. Bulbs are made of scales and leaf  bases and stem remains concealed within scales. Roots are mainly adventitious  and shallow. Flowers have a funnel shaped perianth and are fragrant, waxy  white, about 25 mm long. Stamens are six in number, ovary 3 locular, ovules  numerous and fruits are capsule.<br />
<strong>Climatic Requirement</strong><br />
            In  India, commercial cultivation of tuberose is confined to warm humid areas with  average temperature ranging from 16° to 30°C. Tuberose is also grown in hilly  areas up to 1200 to 1500 meter height. Moist or humid and temperature are the  two main factors responsible for the increasing or decreasing the production.  Temperature over 40°C leads to decrease the length of spike and quality of  flowers. Likewise, fall in temperature or incidence of frost damages the plant  and the flowers. It prefers sunny situation and should not be grown on shady or  semi-shady situation which drastically reduces the flower yield. <br />
Tuberose although not strictly photosensitive, long-day  exposure promotes vegetative growth as well as early emergence of the first  flower spike and also increases the length of flower spike. A day length of 16  hours promoted growth and flowering. <br />
<strong>Soil Requirement</strong><br />
            Tuberose  should be grown in well-drained place, as it cannot tolerate water logging even  for a short period. Tuberose is grown in wide range of soils from light sandy  to clay soils including those affected by salinity and alkalinity conditions.  Fertile loamy and sandy having pH range from 6.5 to 7.5 with good aeration and  drainage are ideal for tuberose cultivation.<br />
<strong>Varieties</strong><strong>: </strong>There are four types of tuberose <br />
<strong>Single:</strong> With one whorl of  corolla and are highly scented which are chiefly used for concrete extraction. Concrete content  has been observed to be 0.08 to 0.11 per cent.  Loose flowers are used for making floral ornaments. Single, Kalyani Single, Shringar, Prajwal, Rajat Rekha, Hyderabad  Single, Culcutta Single are main varieties

				<p><strong>Field Preparation and  Sowing</strong><br />
                    <strong>Preparation of field</strong> <br />
				  The field should be  ploughed deep to a good tilth by 2-3 ploughings (45 cm) and properly manures.  The field is left for 15 days that destroys the weeds and insect-pest. Well  rotten cow dung or farmyard manure, at the rate of 50 tonnes per hectare should  be incorporated in the soil. After field preparation, the plots of appropriate  size should be prepared.<br />
  <strong>Spacing</strong><br />
				  Bulbs  are planted at a spacing of 30x20 cm or 20x20 cm at a depth of 4-6 cm.  40,000-50,000 bulbs are required for one acre planting of tuberose.<br />
  <strong>Propagation</strong><br />
  Tuberose  is propagated by bulbs. In general, bulbs having diameter between 1.5 and 2.5  cm are suitable for planting. About  1.25-1.5 lakh bulbs (800-900 kg) are required for planting one hectare. </p>

<p><br />
  <strong>Seed treatment          </strong><br />
  These  bulbs are first thoroughly cleaned and treated with Bavistin (0.2%) for 30  minutes. Dipping the  bulbs in 4% solution of thiourea can break the resting period. Pre-plant  storage of bulbs at 10°C for a period of 30 days to improve the plant growth,  increased spike and flower yield. <br />
  Pre-planting treatment of bulbs with  GA3, etherel or thiourea promoted early appearance of flower and  produced highest number of longer spikes with  maximum number of florets. <br />
<strong>Season:</strong> Planting done in the month of March-April in plains and April-May  in hills.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Nutrient Management</strong> <br />
            In  general, a basal dose consisting of FYM @ 10 kg/sq m, single super phosphate  and murate of potash each @ 80 g/sq m, 10-15 days prior to the planting of  bulbs is recommended. Nitrogen @ 15 g/sq m should be applied in three split  doses. First one-third dose is given at the time of planting of bulbs, second  at 60 days after planting and the third when flowering starts.<br />
<strong>Water and Irrigation  Management</strong> <br />
            It  is very essential to irrigate before planting to provide optimum moisture for  sprouting and further irrigation should be avoided until the bulbs are  sprouted. During summer, irrigation should be given at weekly interval or even  earlier in case soil dries out and during winter at 10 days interval.<br />
<strong>Weed Management</strong><br />
            Manual  weeding is effective and should be done at monthly interval. <br />
<img width="278" height="224" src="lec41_clip_image002_0001.jpg" align="middle" hspace="12" alt="http://www.biolandes.com/photo-produit/ph--Tubereuse-biolandes-1232024218.jpg" /></p>
<p>For chemical weed control, Atrazine @1.0-1.5 kg /ha in 1000 litres of  water is sprayed immediately after planting of bulbs.<br />
                    <strong>Pest Management</strong><br />
				  The  important insects are thrips, aphids and weevil. Thrips and aphids are  controlled by the spray of Rogor or Metasystox @ 1.75 to 2.0 ml/litre. The  weevils can be controlled by the spray of Thiodon @ 2.0 mg/litre. <br />
                  <strong>Bud borer (<em>Helicoverpa armigera</em>) </strong> <br />
			    This can be  controlled by the spray of endosulfan (0.2%), monocrotophos (0.2%) or Thiodan  (0.5-0.8%). </p>
<strong><br clear="all" />
                </strong>
                <p><strong>Nematodes </strong> <br />
                  Tuberose is damage by nematodes and  resulting extensive yield losses. Nematodes like too-knot nematode (<em>Meloidogyne  incognita </em>and <em>M. javanica</em>) and reniform nematode (<em>Rotylenchulus  renioformis</em>) and also greasy steak caused by <em>Aphelencoids besseyi </em>have  been reported to be responsible for complete wiping out of tuberose flower  industry. Application of Furadon @ 2 g/plant or carbofuran @ 2-5 kg/ha, neem @  1 tonne/ha controls nematode infestation. <br />
  <strong>Disease Management</strong><br />
  <strong>Stem rot</strong><br />
                  The  disease symptom is preceded by the appearance of prominent coarse mycelial  masses on leaf surface at or near the soil level. The infection is caused by <em>Sclerotium  rolfsii</em>. The disease can be controlled by soil application of brassicol or  Zineb (20%) at the rate of 30 kg per hectare. Also, the incidence can be  minimized by reducing soil moisture or planting at wider spacing.<br />
  <strong>Flower Bud rot </strong><br />
                  It  is caused by <em>Erwinia</em> sp. Results in dry rotting of the buds with brown  surched necrotic discoloration of peduncles. The diseased plants should be  uprooted and destroyed. The disease can be controlled by the spray of  Streptomycin (0.01%)<br />
  <strong>Leaf blight or Botrytis blight </strong> <br />
                  Fungal disease caused by Botrytis  elliptica. The disease can be controlled by spraying the plant with ammonical  copper (2%) or Greeno (0.5%). The treatment should be repeated at 15 days  interval. <br />
  <strong>Alternaria leaf spot </strong> <br />
                  Fungal disease caused by <em>Alternaria  polyanth. </em>The disease can be controlled by the spray of Mancozeb (0.2%) or  Iprodione (0.2%) at 10 days interval.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting</strong><br />
  <img width="348" height="206" src="lec41_clip_image004_0001.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="http://www.biolandes.com/photo-produit/ph--Tubereuse-biolandes-1232024158.jpg" /><img width="264" height="206" src="lec41_clip_image006_0000.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7FSbc2LoHGM/SKDixZDdUiI/AAAAAAAABPI/byvmNVJEvWQ/s400/rajni.jpg" /></p>
                <p>            Flowering  of tuberose starts 80 to 100 days after planting and flowering time is July  onwards. Tuberose flowers all the year round. <br />
  Spikes are harvested at bud-burst stage preferably in the  morning before sunrise or late in the evening by clipping with a sharp knife or  secateurs that gives a clean cut. About 4-6 cm basal portion has to be left to  allow the growth of bulb. The lower portion of the cut spikes immediately after  harvest, are to be immersed in water for prolonging life of spikes. For loose  flower purpose individual flowers are plucked early in the morning. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Lifting, Curing,  and Storage of Bulbs </strong> <br />
                <img width="252" height="206" src="lec41_clip_image008_0000.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="http://www.vuatkerala.org/static/eng/advisory/agri/floriculture/tuberose/image/bulbs.jpg" />Bulbs reach maturity at the cessation  of flowering when the leaves become yellow and dry during winter  (February-March) in North India. At this stage, irrigation is withheld and the  soil is allowed to dry. The leaves are cut off at the ground level and the  bulbs are dug out. After digging, the bulbs are lifted out and the adhering  earth shaken off neatly and thoroughly. The offsets are then separated out by  hand, which are used as seed-stock for the next season. The bulbs are the  graded based on the size into mature (&gt; 1.5 cm diameter) and immature (&lt;  1.5 cm diameter). Cleaned and graded bulbs are placed on sheives to dry or  cure. To hasten curing, artificial heat of 27o to 35o C  may be applied. The bulbs must be stirred or have their position changed every  few days to prevent fungal attack and rotting. The  bulbs are also treated with 0.2 per cent Bavistin or mancozeb powder to prevent  them from rotting. An ambient air temperature of at least 18oC for  four to six weeks or exactly six weeks at 30oC stimulates the yield of  commercial sized bulbs. Longer storage at 30oC advances flower spike  yield but the quality of spike deteriorates and the bulb number decreases. <br />
      <strong>Yield</strong><br />
  The  yield of loose flowers/spike depends on variety, planting distance and climate  condition prevailing in the area. One hectare of tuberose plantation yield 4-5  lakhs of spikes per year from single varieties, 10.5 tonnes/ha of loose flowers  may be harvested. In addition, 20 tones/ha of bulbs may be harvested after 2-3  years.</p>
<strong><br clear="all" />
                </strong>
                <p><strong>Post Harvest Activities</strong><br />
                    <strong>Grading </strong> </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> The flower spikes  are graded according to the stalk length, length of rachis, number of flowers  per spike and weight of spikes. </li>
                  <li>Straight and strong stem of uniform length and uniform  stage of development are preferred. </li>
                  <li>Flowers should be free from bruises and diseases and  pests. </li>
                  <li>Florets are graded according to their size for loose  flowers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Packing and  Transport </strong> <br />
                  For room decoration, long spikes are  preferred and are sold in bundles. Each bundle contain 100 spikes. To avoid damage of the flowers and buds, the whole bundle should  be wrapped in soft, white tissue paper or polythene. These bundles  are packed in rectangular bamboo baskets lined with Hessian cloth. <br />
                  For long distance  transport, they are packed in square boxes or airy baskets  but packing in cardboard boxes is more suitable which can be easily transported  by rail, bus or by truck.      Loose flowers are packed in bamboo baskets  holding about 10-15 kg flowers and the baskets are covered with muslin cloth  and are transported to the nearby wholesale market where they are sold by  weight. <br />
  <strong>Holding solutions </strong> <br />
                  A holding  solution consisting of sucrose 2% + Al2(SO4)3 300 ppm was  found best for increasing the post harvest life and quality of cut spikes of  tuberose.</p>
                <p align="center"><img width="184" height="256" src="lec41_clip_image010_0000.jpg" align="middle" hspace="12" alt="http://www.marketmanila.com/images/azu1.JPG" /><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Extraction of Oil and Quality Control</strong><br />
                  The  flower oil is extracted by effleurage and solvent extraction with petroleum  ether. Freshly picked flowers, before they open are effleuraged. About 150 kg  of flowers yield 1 kg of absolute of enfleurage which contains 11-15% of steam  volatile oil. Extraction of tuberose flowers with petroleum ether yield 0.08 –  0.14 per cent of concrete. The concrete contains 3 – 5 per cent of a steam  volatile oil. Out of the approximate total yield of 30,000 kg of loose flowers  from one hectare, in three years, 27.5 kg of ‘concrete’ could be obtained. This  concrete in turn will yield about 5.50 kg of absolute. One hectare of tuberose  plantation may yield upto 12 kg of concrete.<br />
  <strong>Marketing and Export Potential</strong><br />
                  Graded spikes are usually stored less than 24 hours  before they are packed and shipped to the markets. Most tuberose flowers are  shipped in refrigerated trucks. Spikes must be held in an upright position.<br />
  <strong>Miscellaneous  Information</strong> <br />
  <strong>Ratooning</strong> <br />
                  In  November-December, when the temperature drops, the leaves of the plants turn  yellow and die and the plants undergo dormancy. Digging of bulbs should be done  at this stage. With the increase in temperature the crop regains growth from  the previously planted bulbs which is termed as ratooning. The ratoon crop  results in more number of spikes but reduces number of florets, length of  spikes and weight of flowers. Therefore, ratoon crop should be used only for  loose flower or oil extraction purpose.<br />
                  For  ratooning in tuberose, the yellowing plants should be twisted from the ground  level which leads to early maturing of bulbs. For the proper growth and  development of plants, fertilizer dose as given in the main crop should be  applied in two equal split doses in January-February and April. All other  cultural practices should be done as in case of main crop. There is early  flowering in ratoon crop as compared to main crop.<br />
  <strong>Important Tips and Best  Practices for Crop Cultivation</strong> </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Treat the bulbs will 0.2%  Bavistin before planting. </li>
                  <li>The recommended doses of  fertilizers must be applied. </li>
                  <li>The bulbs of 1.5 -2.5 cm  diameter should be planted in for better growth and harvesting. </li>
                  <li>No hoeing/weeding should  be done till the sprouting takes place. </li>
                  <li>Crop is sensitive to  water stagnation so ensure proper drainage or otherwise planting be done on  bund. </li>
