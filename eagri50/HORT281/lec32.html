                  <strong>DRUMSTICK</strong><br />
                  <strong>(<em>Moringa olerifra </em>Lam.) (2n = 22)</strong><br />
(Hindi : Seeng, Sahgan) Family : Moringaceae<br />
            <p>Drumstick is grown for its  nutrient rich tender, but full grown pods, leaves and flowers which are used  for culinary preparations.  Fruits are  rich in vitamin C (120 mg/100g), carotene (110 mg), phosphorus (110 mg) and  minerals like magnesium (28 mg), potassium (259 mg), sulphur (137 mg), chlorine  (423 mg) etc.  The crop is grown in  homesteads for family sues or cultivated commercially for market.  Tender leaves and flowers are comparable to  that of colocasia in vitamins and minerals and have great role for combating  malnutrition of urban and rural masses.   Certain morigna types principally grown for its foliage are reported  from West Indies.  Drumstick roots are  good substitute for horse radish.  Root,  bark and seed have many industrial uses also.<br />
<strong>Origin and distribution</strong><br />
            Originated in  South West India, drumstick became a popular vegetable in South Indian  states.  The crop is widely distributed  in India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Singapore, Malaysia, Cuba, Jamaica and Egypt.<br />
<img width="276" height="205" src="lec32_clip_image002_0000.gif" align="left" hspace="12" /><strong>Botany</strong><br />
            Drumstick is a  small or medium sized perennial tree of about 10 m height with fragile and  corky stem.  The leaves are usually  tri-pinnate with elliptic leaflets.  Pods  are pendulous and length ranges from 20 cm to 100 cm.  Seeds are trigonous with wings on angles.<br />
Flowers are produced on current season growth on large and erect  panicles or monocladial cyme.  Flowers  were yellowish creamy white and sweet smelling.   Individual flowers are bisexual, zygomorphic and pedicellate.<br />
            Calyx and corolla  consist of five sepals and petals.   Androecium also has five stamens alternating with five stamindodes.  Gynoecium has a superior, one celled and  three carpelled ovary containing many ovules on parietal placentation.  Stigma is truncate.<br />
            Flowering in  drumstick varies from place to place and is greatly influenced by rain,  temperature, humidity, wind, soil temperature, soil moisture etc.  Under South Indian condition, one or two  distinct peak periods of flowering noticed.   Peak period of flowering in central parts of Kerala is December-January  while in southern part it is February-March and July-August with maximum flowering  in February-March.  Under Coimbatore and  Bangalore conditions, flowering seasons are March-May and July-September  respectively.  Anthesis continues  throughout the day.  Two anthesis peaks  i.e., 2.00 p.m and 4.00 a.m. are noticed at Thiruvannthapuram.  In most parts of Tamil Nadu, flowering is  from 4.30 a.m. to 6.30 p.m.<br />
<img width="216" height="219" src="lec32_clip_image004_0000.gif" align="left" hspace="12" /><img width="264" height="216" src="lec32_clip_image006_0000.gif" align="left" hspace="12" />            In southern part of Kerala, stigma becomes receptive one  day prior to flower opening and continues with maximum receptivity on the day  of opening and a sudden decline thereafter.

				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Varieties / cultivars</strong><br />
			    A number of local  cultivars are known by the place of their cultivation.  Details of local cultivars are given:</p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li><strong>Jaffna moringa</strong><em> - </em>a perennial type which bares       60-90 cm long pods with soft flesh and good taste.</li>
				  <li><strong>Chavakacheri muringa <em>- </em></strong>a       perennial type producing 90-120 cm long pods.</li>
				  <li><strong>Chemmuringa</strong><em>- </em>This perennial       type flowers throughout year and bears red tipped fruits.</li>
				  <li><strong>Yazhpanam muringa </strong>– same as Jaffna type</li>
				  <li><strong>Pal muringai</strong><em> – </em>Pods having thicker pulp and       better taste</li>
				  <li><strong>Puna muringa</strong><em>­</em>– Thinner fruits.</li>
				  <li><strong>Kodikal muringa</strong>–<strong> </strong>produces short pods of 15-20 cm       long and is sued as support for betel vine plants.  Propagated by seeds.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>There are only a few named  varieties and the details are given below:</strong><br />
                    <strong>KM-1 (Kudumianmalai 1)</strong>– Bushy variety propagated through  seeds.  Plants come to bear 6 months  after planting and can be rationed for 2-3 years.  Productivity 400-500 fruits / year.  Developed at Anna Pannai, Kudumianmalai of  Pudukottai.<br />
                    <img width="198" height="196" src="lec32_clip_image008_0000.gif" align="left" hspace="12" /><strong>PKM </strong>– 1 <strong>– </strong>This “seed moringa”, propagated through seeds is developed at  Horticultural Research Station, TNAU, Periyakulam.  Plants grow to a height of 4-6 m and come to  flower in 90-100 days after planting.   The first harvest starts 160-170 days after planting and on an average  each tree bears 200-225 fruits / year.   Pods are 65-70 cm long with 6.3 cm girth and 150 g weight.  Fruits are green coloured and highly pulpy.<br />
                </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><img width="206" height="190" src="lec32_clip_image010_0000.gif" align="left" hspace="12" /><strong>PKM 2</strong>– This “seed moringa”, propagated through  seeds, is also developed at Horticultural Research Station, TNAU,  Periyakulam.  Pods are extra long (125-130  cm), pulpy and suitable for homestreads.<br />
                    <strong>Dhanraj</strong>– This is also an annual drumstick propgated  through seeds and is evolved at KRC College of agriculture, UAS, Arabhavi,  Karnataka.<br />
				  Crop improvement programmes in the Department of Olericulture,  Kerala Agricultural Unviersity, Vellanikkara resulted in the development of  three promising perennial drumstick clones <em>viz.,</em> MO 70, MO 95 and MO 44  and one annual seed drumstick, AD 4.<br />
                  </p>
				<p><strong>Climate and soil</strong><br />
				  Drumstick is  predominantly a crop of dry and arid tracts.  However intensive cultivation with good  irrigation and systematic cultural practices will give good yield especially  for annual type.  The plant put forth  luxuriant growth at 25-30oC.   Higher temperature results in heavy flower shedding.  Crop is also injured severely by frost.  Though the crop comes up well in all types of  soil, performance is better in sandy loam rich in organic matter.  A pH range of 6.0 – 6.72 is most ideal.<br />
                  <strong>Propagation</strong><br />
				  Perennial types  are propagated through limb cutting of 90-100 cm length and 5-8 cm  diameter.  Annual types are propagated by  seeds.  Average seed weight is 0.288 g  and 10 g contain 35 seeds.  Seeds @ 625 g/  ha can be either sown in pits or transplanted after raising seedlings in  polythene bags.  Transplanting of seedlings  can be made one month after sowing.  It  is always advisable to raise a few plants additionally in polythene bags for  purpose of gap filling.  Time of sowing  of seeds for annual seed drumstick or planting of limb cuttings varies from  region to region depending on receipt of monsoon.<br />
                  <strong>Land preparation</strong><br />
			    Field is ploughed  3-4 times.  Apply FYM @ 20 t ha-1 at last  ploughing.  Take pits of size 45 x 45 x  45 cm at a spacing of 6.0 x 6.0 m for perennial types and 2.5 x 2.5 m for annual  types, apply 10 kg FYM and fill up pits.</p>
				<p><strong>Interculture and manuring</strong><br />
				              To facilitate  side branches, shoot may be nipped off when the seedlings are at 75 cm  height.  Apply 100 g Urea, 100 g Super  phosphate and 50 gm MOP and irrigate heavily.   Top dress plants with 100 g Urea again 3 months after first  application.  Provide light irrigation  for early emergence of seedlings for annual type.<br />
				              After harvest of  main crop, annual types are cut back tone meter height from ground level for  rationing.  These rationed plants develop  new shoots and start bearing four to five months after rationing.  Likewise about three ratoon crops can be  taken.  At each and every ratoon crop,  plants are supplied with N, P and K nutrients as already mentioned along with  20-35 kg of FYM and irrigate.<br />
                  <strong>CURRY LEAF</strong><br />
                  <em>Murraya koenigii</em><br />
                  Rutaceae<strong></strong><br />
                               Curry leaf (<em>Murraya  koenigii</em>) is an important perennial tree vegetable. Its leaves are used  mainly to improve the taste and flavour of foods. Leaves are slightly pungent  and retain their flavour even after drying. Ground curry leaf with mature  coconut kernel and spices forms an excellent preserve. It grows wild in the  foothills and plains of the Himalayas from Kumaon to Sikkim. In south India,  especially in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, at least one curry leaf plant  is found in each homestead. Recently it has gained importance as a commercial  crop. It is cultivated commercially in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. It is also  cultivated in West Bengal, Assam and Deccan Plateau.<br />
                  <strong>Climate and soil</strong><br />
                               Curry leaf can  be cultivated in a wide range of soils. Red sandy loam soil is ideal for its  cultivation. It can tolerate temperature up to 37°C. But below 16°C, its growth  is affected.<br />
                  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
                               There are 2 improved  varieties of curry leaf - DWD 1 and DWD 2. Both of these have a good aroma.  They have an oil content of 5.22% and 4.09% respectively. They are mainly  cultivated in Karnataka. DWD 1 is sensitive to winter season. During winter its  growth is poor, whereas DWD 2 is winter insensitive. It gives higher yield than  DWD 1. ‘Senkaampu’ is a local cultivar grown in many parts of Tamil Nadu.<br />
                  <strong>Cultivation<br />
Propagation</strong><br />
             Curry leaf is mainly  propagated through seeds. For raising seedlings, well-ripe fruits are collected  from high-yielding plants. The seeds are sown either in nursery or polybags  filled with a mixture of 1:1:1 sand, soil and farmyard manure. Seeds germinate  in 3 weeks. One-year-old seedlings are planted in the main field.<br />
<strong>             </strong>It can also be  propagated by root suckers. There are a number of root suckers near its plants.  They are separated from the main plant during rainy season and planted  immediately in the main field.<br />
<strong>Planting</strong> <br />
             Planting in the  main field is done during the monsoon season. The main field is ploughed  thoroughly. Pits of 30cm × 30cm size are dug at a spacing of 4m × 4m. Farmyard  manure @ 10kg/pit is applied.<br />
<strong>Manuring and  fertilization</strong><br />
             Usually curry  leaf plant is not given inorganic fertilizers. But for higher yields, its plant  may be given 10kg farmyard manure and NPK @ 60:80:40g/plant/year. The  fertilizers may be applied at the onset of the monsoon.<br />
<strong>Aftercare</strong> <br />
             The pit should  be irrigated if there is no rain. The plant should be irrigated at 3-day  intervals, if there are no rains. The field should be kept weed free. The  plants should be trained and pruned to maintain a height of 1m. Their terminal  buds are removed to encourage lateral branching. A minimum of 5–6 branches are  kept per plant.<br />
<strong>Harvesting and  Post-harvest management</strong><br />
             Curry leaves are  picked 15 months after planting. Commercial harvest can be started from 3 year  old plants. With good management, normal yield can be obtained up to the age of  20–25 years. The leaves can be harvested at two and a half to three months  intervals, the average yield being 20–25 tonnes/ha.<br />
<strong><em>Coccinia grandis </em></strong><strong>(L.) Voigt.</strong><br />
<strong>Syn: <em>Coccinia indica</em> and <em>C. cordifolia</em> </strong><br />
            The ivy gourd, <em>Cocccinia grandis </em>(L) Voigt, is  commonly known as <em>kundru </em>or <em>tondli. </em>It is a climbing perennial  having small (4-5 cm long and 1-2cm in diameter) ovoid or elliptical. The  fruits are smooth and bright green with stripes which become scarlet red on  ripening. The roots are long and tuberous. The leaves have five lobes with  serrated margin.<br />
            The ivy  gourd is cultivated in India, tropical Africa, Malaysia and other south east  Asian countries, and China. In India it is widely grown in southern; eastern  and western regions, mainly in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharastra,  Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. <br />
            It has about 30 species, occurring  mostly in Africa. Only one species- <em>Coccinia grandis </em>(L.) Voigt. - is  cultivated. It is a perennial found naturally in India and tropical Africa. A  monoecious species is cultivated and the species, <em>C</em>. <em>abyssinica </em>is  grown in Ethiopia for its edible tuberous roots. In India <em>C. grandis </em>(L.)  Voigt. <em>(Coccinia indica </em>Wight &amp; Am.) is distributed in northern  plains and terai regions, extending to peninsular region. </p>
				<p align="center"><img src="lec32_clip_image003_0000.gif" width="472" height="144" border="0" align="middle" usemap="#MicrosoftOfficeMap0" /> </p>
				<p><strong>Origin  and distribution</strong> <br />
				  About 30 species of the genus <em>Coccinia </em>occur wild in Africa. The cultivated species, <em>C. grandis</em> (L) is found growing in nature in  the tropics of India and southeastern Asia besides Africa. It was domesticated  in India and Southeast Asia. In India, the ivy gourd, known as  &quot;bimba&quot; It has been recorded in the Mahabharat period.<br />
				  The ivy gourd is a diploid with  2n=24. Extensive studies on karyotype and chromosome biology have revealed a  pair of heteromorphic chromosomes in the male plant. There is a large  chromosome in the male plant and two x chromosomes in the female plant. The  male plant has 22 autosomes with a pair of XY chromosomes and the female plant  with 22 autosomes and a pair of chromosomes. Polyploidy does not affect  dioecism and male is always heterogametic with Y chromosomes<br />
                  <strong>Genetics  and Breeding </strong> <br />
				  There are no reports on genetics and  breeding of ivy gourd. Almost all the present day cultivars ivy gourd have been  developed by farmers as clonal selections, mainly from seedling progenies  spontaneous mutations. The fruits of the different varieties vary in shape,  size and stripe pattern. There are also few types in which plants with male  flowers are absent and the fruits produced on the female plants are  parthenocarpic. Some types having bitter fruit, not suitable for human  consumption, are also found occasionally.<br />
                  <strong>Area  and production</strong><br />
				  The data on area and production of  ivy gourd are not available.<br />
                  <strong>Uses</strong><br />
				  The immature fruits are cooked and  used in sambar or fried. The tender shoots are also eaten. Leaves, stems and  roots have medicinal uses in ayurvedic and native systems for treatment of skin  diseases, bronchitis and diabetes and also for lowering blood sugar levels. <br />
                  <strong>Production  Technology </strong><br />
                  <strong>Climate</strong><br />
				  The ivy gourd grows best in warm and  humid climate. The optimum temperature requirement is 20 - 30 degree celsius.  In southern region, it continues to produce fruits almost throughout the year  but the peak seasons of fruiting are summer and rainy seasons. In the northern  plains the plants remain dormant during winter and produce fruits only once in  a year.<br />
                  <strong>Soil</strong><br />
				  The most suitable soil for growing  ivy gourd is well drained sandy loam. Heavy clay is to be avoided. The best  soil pH is 6.5. The crop does not grow well in acidic and alkaline soils.<br />
                  <strong>Planting</strong><strong> </strong><br />
				  The ivy  gourd is vegetatively propagated by stem cutting. Semi hardwood cuttings, 15-20  cm long and 1.5-2.0 cm thick, having 5-6 leaves on each cutting, are used for  planting. Two to three cuttings are planted, about 5-6 cm. deep, in each basin  of 60 cm. diameter. The distance between the basins is 1.5-2.0 metre. The  planting is done in June-July or February-March. The plant population in a  field should have female and male plants in a ratio of 10: 1. The plants are  perennial, replanting is advocated after every 4-5 years. The vines are trailed  on bowers or bamboo pandals of 1.25-1.50 m. height. The dimensions vary  according to the requirement. <br />
                  <strong>Manures and Fertilizers </strong><br />
				  About 20  tonnes of FYM are applied at the time of basin preparation and planting. The  fertilizer requirements are 60-80 kg N, 40-60 kg P and 40 kg K per hectare.  Both manures and fertilizers are applied every year before fruiting starts. The  plants start fruiting in 10-12 weeks after planting. The vines are pruned back  after the fruiting is completed, leaving 60-75 cm long vines. In N plants are  pruned twice in a year, in September and April. About 8-10 mm thick is pruned  back to two buds. Every year after pruning about 3-5 kg. FYM is applied to each  plant.<br />
                  <strong>Interculture </strong><br />
				  Weeding  and light hoeing are done during the early stages of vine growth. <br />
                  <strong>Irrigation </strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The plants require light irrigation at 10-12 days  interval during summer. Watering may not be necessary in rainy season. The soil  should have adequate moisture during flowering and water logging is harmful to  the plants. <strong></strong><br />
                  <strong>Yield</strong><br />
				  The  flowering starts after 50-60 days of planting. The average yield is about 10-15  tonnes per hectare.<br />
                  <strong>Storage</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The immature fruits after harvesting can be stored at  room temperature for about a week.<br />
