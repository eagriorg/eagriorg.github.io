                    <strong>CARROT  - (<em>Daucus carota </em>L.)</strong><br />
                    <strong>(2n – 2 x 18)</strong><br />
				  (Hindi  – Gajar)<br />
				  Family:  Apiaceae<br />
			    <p>Carrot is an ancient cool season  root vegetable.  Roots are used for  making soups, stews, curries, pies, pickles and for salad purposes.  Sweet preparation ‘gajar halwa’ prepared out  of carrot is delicious and popular.   Roots are also canned.  Carrot  roots are rich sources of α and β carotenes (1890 μ g/100g) and contain sucrose  10 times that of glucose or fructose.   Carrot leaves are a good source of leaf protein. It is sued as fodder  and for preparation of poultry feeds.<br />
				  Carrot has many medicinal  properties. It increases quantity of urine and helps in elimination of uric  acid.  It has cooling effect and is  beneficial for people suffering from gall stones, constipation and heat  troubles.<br />
				  Purple and black carrots are used  for preparation of a beverage called ‘kanji which is a good appetizer.  In France, essential oil separated from seeds  is sued for flavouring liquors and all kinds of food substitutes.<br />
  <strong>Origin</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>According to Mackevic (1929),  Afghanistan is the primary centres of origin of carrot since a large diversity  for morphological and root characters occur.   Considerable variability for root also exists in India, indicating India  also as a centre of origin.  Root colour  varies from absolutely colourless through light lemon light orange, deep  orange, light purple, deep purple to almost black.<br />
  <strong>Botany</strong><br />
				  Carrot is an annual or biennial herb  with an erect or branched stem (30-120 cm high) arising from a thick fleshy  root.  Leaves are pinnate.  Edible portion is the fleshy tap root  composed of an outer cortex (phloem) and inner core (xylem).  Inflorescence is compound umbel and is  produced during second phase.  Anthesis  in a single umbel is completed in 7-9 days.   Individual flowers are bisexual with white or yellow petals.  They so called carrot seed is actually a  fruit, an indehiscent mericarp, which consists of a single seed.  Two mericarps pair to form a single  rhizocarp, the real carrot fruit which develops from a two-loculed ovary.</p>

			    <p><strong> </strong><strong>Root development</strong></p>
				            
				  <p>In  most cultivars, the root first grows in length and then increases sits  diameter.  By 12-16 days after sowing,  the tap root reaches its optimum length.   Shape and size of roots are influenced by several factors.  Varietal characters, un-decomposed organic  matter, any obstruction to its downward growth etc. are a few factors causing  cracking, forking and branching of roots.   Temperature also influences shape of root.  Variety Chantney produces longer and more  slender roots at 18oC, while they 7 were shorter and thicker at 24oC.  High temperature and irregular water supply  cause deep depression on roots causing rough root</p>
				  <p>surface.  Excessive irrigation after drought results in  white corky outgrowth where side roots may develop.<br />
            Temperature has significant  influence on colour and development of roots.   A temperature range of 15.5 – 21.1oC is the best for colour  development.  Carotene content decreases  above 21.1oC and below 15.5oC.  Usually the young roots are yellowish in  colour which changes to whitish yellow, light yellow, dark yellow, orange or  orange red as a result of accumulation of carotenoids pigments.  Carotene accumulation takes place first in  old phloem cells followed by old xylem vessels and finally to centre core.<br />
<strong>Cultivars / Varieties</strong><br />
            Varieties with long, orange coloured  and smooth roots are preferred in India.   Many varieties, both indigenous and exotic, differing in temperature  requirement, length, size, shape and colour of roots and duration of crop are  grown in India.  Varieties are also  classified into temperate and tropical types.</p>
			      <ol start="1" type="a">
                    <li>Temperate or European or biennial       types require a low temperature of 4-8oC for flowering.  They do not produce seeds in plains of       India, e.g., Nantes, Half long, Early Nantes, Pusa Yamadagini and Ooty 1.</li>
			        <li>Tropical or Asiatic or oriental       or annual types which do not require low temperature for flowering and       they produce seeds in plains of North India.  E.g., Pusa Kesar, Pusa Meghali.</li>
		        </ol>
			      <p>A brief description of important  varieties is given below:<br />
                      <strong>Tropical varieties</strong><br />
                      <strong>Pusa Kesar:</strong>Evolved at IARI, New  Delhi by selection from a cross between Local Red and Nantes Half Long.  Roots are scarlet in colour sufficiently red  coloured central core compared to yellow or white core in Local; roots stay one  month more than the Local red without bolting; contains high carotene (38  mg/100 g).<br />
                      <strong>Pusa Meghali:</strong> Selection made at IARI, New Delhi by crossing  Pusa Kesar and Nantes. It has long orange coloured tapering roots with self  coloured roots.<br />
                      <strong>Hisar Gairic:</strong> Roots long (18.5 cm), tapering, light brick  red in colour, less fibrous with thin self colouring core.  Yield 25-30 t/ha.<br />
                      <strong>European varieties</strong><br />
                      <strong>Nantes Half Long:</strong>The variety commonly  known as Nantes is evolved at IARI Regional Station, Katrain; roots are small,  slim, rough, sweet, cylindrical and stumpy with abrupt tail; the core is small  and self coloured; yield is 15-20 t/ha in 90-110 days.<br />
                      <strong>Early Nantes:</strong> Roots almost cylindrical terminating abruptly  in small thin tail, 12-15 cm long, orange flesh with self coloured core;  duration 90-100 days.<br />
                      <strong>Chantenay:</strong> Suitable for canning and storage; roots are  reddish orange with a length of 11.5 – 15.0 cm.<br />
                      <strong>Chaman:</strong> Developed at SKUA&amp;T, Srinagar; roots long,  cylindrical and semi blunt; tolerant to cracking; yields 25-27 t/ha.<br />
                      <strong>Pusa Yamadagini:</strong>Developed at IARI  Regional Station, Katrain; roots 15-16 cm long, orange with self coloured core,  slightly tapering and semi-stumpy with medium top;  9-10 t/ha in 90-100 days.<br />
                      <strong>Ooty-1:</strong>Developed at Horticultural Research  Station (TNAU), Udhagamandalam<strong>:</strong> roots are 25 cm long with deep orange  colour; yield 45-50 t/ha in 100-110 days.<br />
                      <strong>Zino:</strong>Introduced from Germany in the  Nilgiris hills of Tamil Nadu by the State Department of Horticulture; roots  deep orange with self coloured core; duration 110-120 days.<br />
			        Imported varieties like Danvers and  Imperator are also popular in the country.   Gold King Indian Kuroda, Nebora and Super Kuroda are a few of the carrot  varieties marketed by private seed industry.<br />
  <strong>Climate </strong><br />
			        Climatic and soil factors have great  influence on shape and colour development of roots.  Carrot is grown as a spring summer and autumn  crop in hills and as a winter crop in plains of North India.  Ideal temperature for germination of seeds is  7.2-23.9oC, while for root growth and development it is 18.3-23.9oC.  Tropical types produce roots even at a  temperature of 25oC.<br />
			        European types require a low  temperature of 4.8-10.0oC for 4-6 weeks at any time during  development of roots or after they mature either in storage or in field.  Seed stalk formation takes place only when  plants are subjected to a subsequent temperature of 12.2 – 21.1oC.<br />
  <strong>Soil</strong><br />
			        Deep and well drained friable soils  are essential for proper root development.   For early crop, sandy loam and for heavy yield, silt loam is preferred.  Long rooted cultivars perform the best in light soil.  In heavy soils, short stump rooted varieties  having round and heart-shaped roots are preferred.  In hard soils, roots will be rough and  coarse.  The ideal soil pH is 6.6 – 7.1</p>
			      <p><strong>Land preparation and sowing</strong><br />
			        Soil is ploughed to a fine  tilth.  Utmost can should be taken to  remove clods, stones etc.  Land is then  made to ridges and furrows at 30-45 cm apart in small plots of convenient size  for irrigation.  Seeds are sown on ridges  or on flat beds either by dibbling in lines or by broadcasting.  Seeds are first rubbed to remove fine hairs  and mixed with fine sand before sowing to facilitate even distribution.  For sowing in lines, a small furrow of about  1.5 cm deep is made at top or on either sides of ridges with finger or with  sharp end of a stick.  Seeds mixed with  sand are dropped in furrow by hand and is covered lightly with soil.  Seed rate varies from 6 to 10 kg/ha depending  on variety and sowing.  Seedlings should  be thinned to a plant to plant distance of 5-8 cm, soon after they are  established.  Otherwise,over crowding  leads to deformed roots.<br />
			        It is advisable to give light  irrigation immediately after sowing or to soak seeds in water for 12-24 hours  before sowing to hasten germination.<br />
  <strong>Manuring</strong><br />
			        In addition to 20-25 tonnes of  farmyard manure, a fertilizer dose of 40-50 kg N, 40-50 kg P2O5  and 80-100 kg K2O is recommended for the crop, of which entire dose  of farmyard manure, half N and full P and K are to be applied as basal dose at  the time of final land preparation.   Remaining dose of N can be applied at the time of first hoeing.<br />
  <strong>Interculture</strong><br />
			        Carrot seeds take about a week to  germinate and initial growth of seedlings is rather slow.  First irrigation should be given immediately  after sowing followed by another 4-6 days after.  Soil should be kept moist by frequent light  irrigation for proper growth of roots.   Excessive irrigation, that too towards the last stage, should be avoided  as sit may result in excessive vegetative growth.<br />
			        Since seedlings grow very slowly  care should be taken to remove weed growth during initial stages.<br />
			        Carrot roots do not come up like  that of radish and hence, earthing up is not required.  Soil should be hoed frequently to allow  proper aeration and to prevent discolouration of crown.<br />
  <strong>Harvest</strong><br />
			        Roots grown on ridges are usually  harvested after loosening soil with a spade and by pulling out roots by  grasping top.  In flat ground, top is  removed close to ground and roots are dug out with a spade.  A light irrigation is usually given before  harvesting for easy uprooting.<br />
			        Yield varies with season, climate,  varieties etc.  Tropical types yield  20-30 t/ha. and European types yield 10-15 t/ha.<br />
			        Harvested roots are put in mulberry  basket and dipped in flowering water for washing.  Roots are then partially dried, trimmed and  graded before sending to distant markets.   Trimming, grading etc. are done at a cool place.  Fresh Carrot roots can be stored for 3-4 days  under ordinary conditions and for six months at 0oC and 93-98% RH.<br />
  <strong>Seed production</strong><br />
			        Tropical annual types produce seeds  in plains and temperate biennial types in hills.  Both root to seed and seed to seed methods  are recommended for carrot seed production.   Seed to seed method is followed to get more seed yield.  Root to seed method is flowed to get quality  seeds.  However, in this method, high  incidence of root rot is noticed.  To  check root rot in transplanted crop, planting roots without cutting is  recommended.<br />
			        Carrot is a cross-pollinated crop  due to protandry and pollination is done by honey bees.  Being a cross-pollinated crop, allow an  isolation distance of 1000 m from other varieties.  Opening of umbel starts from periphery and  completed within 6-7 days.  Seed yield is  500-600 kg/ha.<br />
  <strong>Pests and diseases</strong><br />
			        Pests and diseases are not major  problems in cultivation of carrots.   Among pests, carrot rust fly (<em>Psila  rosae</em>) maggots burrow into roots resulting in unmarketable roots.  Lycus bug damages seed crop and reduces viability and  germination of seeds.  Seed treatment  with insecticides controls this pest.<br />
			        Among diseases, <em>Cercocpora leaf spot and root rot caused by Fusarium oxysporum </em>adversely  affect stand of crop.  Watery soft rot  caused by <em>Sclerotenia sclerotianum </em>occurs  in storage.<br />
			        <strong>Physiological disorders</strong><br />
  <strong>Cavity spot -</strong>This is primarily  caused by calcium deficiency induced by excess potassium.  Symptoms appear as a cavity in cortex.</p>

		        <p><strong>Carrot  splitting –</strong>Splitting or cracking of roots is a major problem in  carrot cultivation.  Though this is a  genetic character, other factors are also influencing cracking.  Excess nitrogen and its untimely application  promote cracking.</p>
