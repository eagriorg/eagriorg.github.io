                  <strong>Scientific name:</strong> <em>Dendranthema grandiflora</em><br />
                  <strong>Local name</strong>: Chrysanthemum<br />
                  <strong>Hindi name:</strong> Guldaudi<br />
                  <strong>Family:</strong> Asteracea<br />
                  <strong>Origin  and History</strong>            
				
				<p>It is native to the northern  hemisphere chiefly Europe and Asia. Historically, Confucius the great Chinese  philosopher has, in his writing, mentioned chrysanthemum as early as in 500 BC  making it one of the most ancient cultivated flower of the world. In England,  the popularity of chrysanthemum as exhibition flower is at its peak. It has  second ranks as commercial crop. In the United States, it is the number one  dollar earner flower and the most reliable. It is difficult to say with  certainty when its culture began in India. Shant Gyanehswar has mentioned it in  his famous Marathi exposition of Gita “Gyaneshwari” written in AD 1290. The  Hindi name guldaudi (meaning flower of Daud) suggests that it must have been  grown during the Moghul period in this country.<strong><img width="288" height="216" src="lec38_clip_image002.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /></strong><br />
<strong>Uses</strong> <br />
            Chrysanthemum is versatile; it  can be planted in the bed, cultured in the pot, used for garland making and  also as cut-flower for flower arrangement. In India, large flowered varieties  are grown for exhibition purpose while small flowered varieties are grown for  cut flower, making garland, wreaths, veni and religious offerings.<br />
<strong>Area  and Distribution</strong> <br />
            The chrysanthemum is one of the most  important flower crops commercially grown in different parts of the world. The  Netherlands, Italy, Colombia, Spain, Germany and USA are the important  countries where it is mainly grown under greenhouse conditions. In India, it is  commercially grown in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Maharastra. In different  states of India, it is grown with different names, Guldaudi in Hindi belt,  Chandramalika, in the eastern state, Samanti in the southern states and  Shevanti in the western states. It is grown in on area of about 4,000 ha. <br />
<strong>Botanical  description</strong><br />
            It belongs to family Asteraceae. The  species of chrysanthemum have fibrous root system (shallow rooted plant),  herbaceous perennial plant growing to 50-150 cm tall, with deeply lobed leaves and  large flower heads, white, yellow or pink.<br />
<strong>Climate  Requirement </strong><br />
            Chrysanthemum requires long days for  good vegetative growth and short days for flowering. The most important  environmental factors influencing the growth and flowering of these plants are  light and temperature. The rate of vegetative growth and flowering are also  affected by temperature. The optimum temperature of 15.6 0C is  required. The relative humidity of 70 to 90% is suitable for the plants.&nbsp; <br />
<strong>Soil  Requirement </strong><br />
            The ideal soil for chrysanthemum  growing is a well drained, sandy loam of good texture and aeration. Good amount  of organic matter and pH of 6.5 is essential. It is a shallow fibrous rooted  plant and is very sensible to water logged conditions.<br />
<strong>Varieties </strong><br />
            Brief description of the some of the  important varieties developed at different research institutions are given  below:<br />
<strong>Kirti: </strong>It is hybrid between  Angle x G.P.I. It flowers early (88 days). It bears white coloured Korean type  of flowers which fades to pink tinge.

                <img src="lec38_clip_image004.gif" width="445" height="106" align="middle" />                
				<p><strong>Coimbatore varieties: </strong>Selection from a local variety of  Coimbatore. It has longer flowering duration as compared to the parent. CO 1  (yellow coloured flowers), CO 2 (purple coloured flowers) and MDU 1 (yellow  coloured flowers) are commonly cultivated.
		      <p align="center"><strong>Pankaj: </strong>It bears pink  attractive flowers, which are decorative type. Diameter of flower is 4.8 cm  which weigh 2.68 g. It is high yielding and produces 140 flowers with a yield  of 363 g per plant. Its attractive flowers on stiff stalk make them suitable  for cut flower purpose. Loose flowers can be used for floral decoration.<br />
                    <strong>Preparation  of field</strong><br />
				  The field is ploughed two to three  times before preparation of beds for planting. Trials conducted under All India  Coordinated Research Project on Floriculture recommended a basal application of  FYM @ 5 kg/m2.<br />
  <strong>Time  of planting</strong> <br />
				  Terminal cuttings of stock plants  are taken in June and they are transplanted after rooting in 15 cm pots at the  end of July. These plants are ready for pinching during end of August or  beginning of September.<br />
  <strong>Spacing</strong><br />
				  30 x 30 cm (plant to plant and  row to row)<br />
  <strong>Propagation</strong> <br />
				  Chrysanthemum is propagated  vegetatively through suckers, cuttings or by micro-propagation. <br />
  <strong>Suckers</strong><br />
				  After flowering, the stem is cut  back just above the ground. This induces the formation of side suckers which  are separated from the mother plant and are planted in sand bed. Well rooted  suckers can be directly transplanted in the field.<br />
				  To plant one hectare of land, 1,  11,000 suckers obtained from 15 cents of the previous crop are required. Dip  the roots of the suckers in 1 g Emisan in 1 lit of water to protect against  wilt. The suckers are planted during June - July at 30 x 30 cm spacing on one  side of the ridges. Pinching is done once in 4 weeks after planting to induce  more branching.<br />
  <strong>Terminal  Cuttings</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>These cuttings are taken from a healthy stock plant.  Length of cuttings is about 5-7 cm. The cuttings are dipped in 2500 ppm indole  butyric acid (IBA) or in seradex/ keradex (rooting hormone). These cuttings are  put in sand beds in shade conditions.<br />
  <strong>Nutrient Management</strong><br />
				  As the crop responds well to  manuring, add 8-10 tonnes of well rotten FYM per acre. Apply 50 kg of Nitrogen,  160 kg P2O5 and 80 kg K2O as a basal dose.  Spray GA3 at 50 ppm at 30, 45 and 60 days after planting to increase the flower  yield.<br />
  <strong>Irrigation Management</strong><br />
				  The frequency of irrigation depends  on the stage of growth, soil and weather conditions. Proper drainage system  should be maintained for chrysanthemum grown both in beds and in pots. The  height and vigour of the chrysanthemum plant can be influenced by regulating  quantity and frequency of irrigation. In our country, the method of irrigating  the fields is by channel system and for pots manual bucket system <br />
  <strong>Weed Management</strong><br />
				  Weeds should be avoided in the  greenhouse as well as fields. They deplete moisture and nourishment from  plants. Shortly after cuttings are established, carefully scratch the ground to  uproot the weeds when they are small. 2-3 hand weeding are required for proper  growth of the plant. First weeding should be done one month after planting.  Herbicide can also be applied to control weeds from the field.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting</strong><br />
				  Depending upon the varieties  plant start yielding flower after 3-4 months of transplanting. For cut flower  purpose, stem is cut about 10 cm above the soil to avoid cutting into wooden  tissue. The lower 1/3 of stem are placed in water to extend the vase life of  cut flowers. The best way to protect the flowers is to sleeve the bunch with a  transparent plastic sleeve. The correct stages of harvest depend up on the  cultivar, marketing and purpose etc.<br />
  <strong>Yield</strong><br />
				  Flowering seasons vary from  region to region. The natural blooming seasons for most of the regions lasts  from July to February. One can harvest the flowers around 15 times. The yield  ranges from 9 to 10 tonnes of loose flowers per acre. <br />
  <strong>Post  Harvest Activities </strong><br />
				  Loose flowers are packed in bamboo  baskets or gunny bags for marketing. The capacity of bamboo baskets ranges from  1 to 7 kg while gunny bags can accommodate 30 kg of loose flowers.<br />
  <strong>CUT  CHRYSANTHEMUM (<em>Dendranthema grandiflora</em> Tzeuleu)</strong><br />
  <img width="367" height="248" src="lec38_clip_image006.jpg" align="middle" hspace="12" /><strong> </strong></p>
				<p><strong>Varieties</strong><br />
				  Ajay,  Sonali, Swarna, Ravi Kiran, Akash, Yellow Start, Chandrakand, Red Gold, Indira  and Rakhee are some of the popular varieties.<br />
  <strong>Growing  media&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />
				  The  growing media consists of soil, compost and coco peat in the ratio of 1:1:2.  The beds are formed with 1 m width, 0.3m height and at convenient length. The  soil pH must be 6.5 with 1 to 1.5 EC (Electrical  Conductivity).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  <strong>Propagation  and planting</strong><br />
				  Rooted  cuttings are planted at 20 cm between rows and 15 cm between plants within the  row, accommodating 30 plants/m2.<br />
  <strong>Irrigation </strong><br />
				  About  8 – 9 lit of water/sq.mt is required/day.<br />
  <strong>Fertilizer  management</strong><br />
				  NPK  @ 20:20:10 g/m2 is applied through fertigation at weekly intervals<br />
  <strong>Growth  regulators</strong><br />
				  Alar  50 – 150 gm/100 lit water and B 9 at 8 – 25 ml/lit of water is used twice at  the growing stage.</p>
				<p><strong>Pinching</strong><br />
            Removal  of the growing tip is done at 3rd and 5th week after  planting to encourage axillary shoots.<br />
<strong>Disbudding</strong><br />
            Removal  of excess flower buds is done 7 weeks after planting to improve the flower  size.<br />
<strong>Blindness</strong><br />
            It  occurs when the night temperature is too low and the days are short at the time  when flower buds are forming. A rosetted type of growth is indicative of this  difficulty. Center petals that fail to develop can be due to excessive heat; or  in dark weather some varieties apparently lack enough food to open the flower.  Chlorosis, or yellowing of the upper foliage, is generally associated with over  watering, excessive fertilizer in the soil, or insects or diseases attacking  the root system. Continued growth of shoots and failure to form flower buds  when short days are started the mean night temperature was too low. Sunscald is  prevalent on standards in flower in very warm weather. The petals turn brown  and dry up.<br />

				<p><strong>Harvest</strong><br />
                    <strong>Harvest  index</strong><br />
				  Flowers  are cut s<img width="258" height="258" src="lec38_clip_image005.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" />oon after the disappearance of green colour in the centre of the  flowers and the center petals are fully expanded. Pompons are cut when they are  fully developed. Spray types should be cut when the central flower is open and  the surrounding flowers are well developed and the varieties which shed pollen  badly will have to be cut before they become unsighty. Cutting the stem while the flowers are  slightly on the “green” side is preferred because it offers a better quality  product for the customer. Harvested flowers are to be kept immediately in a  bucket containing water and preservatives to avoid desiccation.<strong></strong><br />
  <strong>Yield&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />
				  The  yield ranges about  270 sprays / m2 <br />
  <strong>Post harvest technology</strong> <br />
				  Grading of flowers depends on colour, diameter of flower  and on stem length. </p>

				<p>            After  harvest, the stem have to be cut at equal length (90 cm is the standard),  bunched in five, putting a rubber band at the base and sliding them into a  plastic sleeve and putting bunches in plastic buckets filled with water. The  mature chrysanthemum can be stored dry for 6-8 weeks at a temperature of 0.5 0  C. Early morning on the day of shipment (or night before), bunches can be  packed in boxes.<br />
                    <strong>Common  features for both cut and loose chrysanthemum</strong> <br />
                    <strong>Marketing  and Transportation</strong><br />
				  Transporting of flowers is done  through train, trucks, ships (refrigerated) etc. Before a long day transport,  it is better to keep flowers in water for at least 4 hours in a cold store.  Among the cut flowers chrysanthemum are amongst the top three best selling  flower in all most all major flower consuming countries.<br />
				  Few  striking features which have made this flower commercial in the international  market are:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The  standard type flowers fetch higher price though their share is less.</li>
				  <li>Spray  types have smaller flower size and has major share in the world market.</li>
				  <li>Maximum  imports from European nation are from June to October. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>            International market of  chrysanthemum is in Japan, the Netherlands, Germany, United Kingdom, United  States, France, Italy, Denmark and Belgium.<br />
                    <strong>Best  Practices of Crop Cultivation</strong><br />
                    <strong>Pinching</strong> <br />
				  After planting the growth is  mostly upwards with very little branching. To arrest such tall growth, a single  procedure called ‘pinching’ is used. Only soft vegetative shoot tips 1.5 to 3.0  cm long are removed. Pinching is one of the most important operations in chrysanthemum  culture. Pinching is most essential for small flowered chrysanthemum. Pinching  increases the number of flowering stems in each plant.<br />
  <strong>Disbudding  &amp; De-shooting</strong> <br />
				  These operations are mostly  performed for long flowering &amp; decorative type chrysanthemum. Disbudding of  spray varieties is very easy because in this case only the large apical bud is  removed and the auxiliary buds are allowed to develop, while in standard  varieties remove all axillary buds &amp; apical bud is allowed to develop.<br />
  <strong>Staking  of plants</strong> <br />
				  Staking is necessary to keep plants  erect and to maintain proper shape of plants and bloom. Stakes are prepared  mostly from bamboo sticks. Staking of plants is required for vertical support  of the plants. Only one stake is used when a grower needs single bloom per  plant. <br />
  <strong>Desuckering</strong><br />
				  For proper and vigorous growth  of the plant; suckers are removed from time to time. Without de-suckering, the  main plant will loose vigour and become weak. <br />
  <strong>Important Tips and best  practices for crop cultivation</strong> </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Always  use disease free planting material</li>
				  <li>Crop  rotation should be practiced</li>
				  <li>Proper  pinching and disbudding should be followed for standard/spray chrysanthemum  production</li>
				  <li>Maintain  proper temperature for quality flower production.</li>
				  <li>Use  bamboo stick for the support of tender stem of the plant.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Pest Management </strong><br />
                    <strong>Common  pest their</strong> <strong>Control  measures: </strong></p>
				<p><strong>Aphids</strong> (<em>Myzus persicae</em>)<br />
				  This are small greenish to black dot  like insects which are seen in large number sucking the sap from the tender  parts like stem tips, flower buds and young leaves. The affected flower buds  fail to open and dry up before opening. Damage begins in December and is in  peak during Feb-March.<br />
  <strong>Control  measures</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Spraying at fortnightly interval with 0. 5% Monocrotophos  or 0.1% Malathion or 0.02% Phosphomidon.<br />
  <strong>Mites </strong>(T<em>etranychus  urticae</em>)<strong></strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Very minute dot-like insects of red colour seen on the  under surface of leaves, particularly in hot dry season. The affected flower  buds fail to open and dry up even before opening.<br />
  <strong>Control  measures</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Spray of 0.05% Dicofol or 0.05% Vertimac or Pentac at  fortnightly interval.<br />
  <strong>Thrips  (</strong><em>Thrips tabaci</em><strong>)</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Thrips cause damage to summer blooming varieties.  Infected flowers become discoloured &amp; dry.<br />
  <strong>Control  measures</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Spraying Dimethoate at 0.05 per cent 2 or 3 times at 15  days interval.<br />
  <strong>Leaf  miners (</strong><em>Phythomgza  syngenesiae</em><strong>): </strong> <br />
				  Incidence is maximum during  March-June. The infestation is more severe in polyhouse. The young maggot stage  attacks the leaves by making tunnels in between the upper and lower surface of  the leaf. In severe cases, the leaves completely dry up and fall off.<br />
  <strong>Control measures</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Removal  &amp; destruction of affected leaves help in containing the spread.</li>
				  <li>Spraying  of 0.05% Monocrotophos or 0.05% Triazophos.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Leaf  folder</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>All the larval stage attack the plant with the help of  silky threads, the larve folds the leaves starts feeding on leaves from inside.<br />
                    <strong>Control  measures</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Spray 0.02% Cypermethrin or 0.02% Decamethrin or 0.05%  Quinolophos at fortnightly interval.<br />
                    <strong>Disease Management </strong><br />
                    <strong>Common  Diseases &amp; their Control Measures </strong><br />
                    <strong>Root  rot</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>(<em>Pythium</em> spp or <em>Phytophthora</em> spp) In this  disease the infected plant suddenly wilt the plant parts like roots, stems,  leaves.<br />
                    <strong>Control  measures</strong> </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Provide  good drainage conditions to prevent water logging.</li>
				  <li>Soil  drench with Thiram or Captan or mixture of both at the rate of 2.5 g/m2 area  prevents the infection. </li>
				  <li>Mancozeb,  Metalaxyl and Fosetyl also used for control.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Leaf  spot: </strong>(<em>Septoria  chrysanthemella</em>)<br />
				  Grayish brown spots appear on leaves  which turn yellow surroundings. When flowering starts, the infection occurs on  flower buds, which rot completely. The disease spreads from down to upwards.<br />
  <strong>Control  measures</strong> </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Spraying  with Mancozeb at fortnightly interval helps in controlling the disease.</li>
				  <li>Burning  and destroying of infected leaves.</li>
				  <li>Spray  of Copper Oxychloride (0.2%)</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Wilt:</strong> (<em>Verticillium</em> dahliae.)<br />
				  The leaves turn yellow to grey and  the branch or whole plant wilts gradually. It may occur due to a number of  diseases, disorders or even just lack of water.<br />
  <strong>Control  measures</strong> </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Solarization  of soil by using black polythene mulch during summer months.</li>
				  <li>Soil  treatment with Dithane M-45 (0.2%)</li>
				  <li>Dipping  of rooted cuttings in Benomyl suspension before planting.</li>
				  <li>Use  of resistant varieties.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><img width="263" height="164" src="lec38_clip_image002_0000.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /><strong>Rust:</strong> (<em>Puccinia spp</em>) <br />
				  It is serious disease especially in  the early spring. Brown spores appear in the underside of the leaves. Severely  infected plants become very weak and fail to bloom properly.<br />
  <strong>Control measures</strong> </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Sanitation and clean cultivation  prevent the disease.</li>
				  <li>Early  removal of infected leaves.</li>
				  <li>Dusting  plants either with sulphur and other fungicides such as Zineb, Captan etc. can  be used.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Powdery  mildew: </strong>(<em>Oidium  chrysanthemi</em>)<br />
				  There is powdery coating on the  leaves appear. It may lead to defoliation.<br />
  <strong>Control  measures: </strong>Use of  Sulphur fungicides or Carbendazim <br />
  <strong>Viral  disease</strong><br />
  <strong>Chrysanthemum  stunt</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Overall reduction in plant size, foliage become pale in  colour, flower may open prematurely. Disease occur diving pinching. This  disease occurs during pinching.<br />
  <img width="276" height="156" src="lec38_clip_image004.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="DN07001_F1" /><strong>Control measures</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Use of cuttings from virus free plants.<br />
  <strong>Chrysanthemum  mosaic disease</strong> <br />
				  1. Cuttings  should be obtained from virus – free indexed stocks.<br />
				  2.  Removal and destruction of infected plants.<br />
				  3.  Destruction of the weed host.<br />
				  4.  Spraying Monocrotophos 0.05 per cent controls the vector and reduces the  disease.<br />
  <strong>Alternative  Use and Value Addition </strong><br />
				  Besides being used for cut/loose flower purpose, it is  also used for garlands, bouquet, greeting cards, dry flower etc.<br />
  <strong>As cut flowers</strong><br />
