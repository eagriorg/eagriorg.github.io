                    <strong>CAULIFLOWER  -</strong><strong><em> Brassica oleracea var. Botrytis</em></strong><strong> </strong><br />
				  Family:  Cruciferae<br />
				  (Chromosome  Number: 2n=18)<br />
  <strong>Origin  and History</strong><br />
			    <p>The  name cauliflower consists of two Latin words, ‘caulis’ and ‘floris’, former  means cabbage and the later means flowers.   It is originated from wild cabbage known as ‘Cole warts’, through  mutation, human selection and adoption.   Dr. Jemson at Saharanpur introduced it to India in 1822 during the  period of East India Company (Swarup and Chatterjee, 1972).  The original introduction was “Cornish  types”, which originated in England followed by temperate types, originated in  Germany and Netherlands in 18th century.  The present tropical Indian cauliflower  developed as a result of inter crossing between European and Cornish  types.  Another development also took  place in India, resulting in tropical types resistant to high temperature and  high rainfall.  These types are grown in  Indian plains from May to September followed by temperate types commonly known  as snowball cauliflower got established around Mediterranean region  particularly in Italy.  Its further  development and improvement were achieved in North and North Western Europe extending  its cultivation to 60oN.  The development  of Indian cauliflower types made it possible to extend its growing area in the  tropics and subtropics of the world.  The  crop is presently cultivated from 11oN to 60oN.  The different types of cauliflower like  Cornish, Northerns, Roscoff, Angers and Erfurts originated from the Italians  independently in different region like Cornish and northern England, Roscoff  and Angers in France and Erfurts or Snowball in Germany and the  Netherlands.  Cornish type, perhaps the  first to be introduced in India, has itself gone out of cultivation after  contributing many genes to Indian varieties like resistance to black rot,  self-incompatibility, curd flavour, open plant habit, exposed yellow loose  curds etc. (Swarup and Chatterjee, 1972).<br />
  <strong>Nutritive  Value and Uses</strong><br />
			    The  edible part of cauliflower is known as curd, which consists of a shoot system  with short internodes, branches apices and bracts.  The edible portion of this vegetable is  approximately 45 per cent of the vegetable as purchased.  It has high quality of proteins and peculiar  in stability of vitamin C after cooking.   It is rich in minerals such as potassium, sodium, iron, phosphorus,  calcium, magnesium etc.  It also contains  vitamin A (Nath, 1976) Conew (1959) has made an analysis on fresh weight  basis.  Cauliflower contains 92.7 per  cent water and the food value per 100 g of edible ascorbic acid 70 mg, thiamine  0.2 mg, riboflavin 0.1 mg and niacin 0.57 mg.   Sulphur containing compounds <em>viz;</em> hydrogen sulfide methanethiol,  ethanethiol, propanethiol and dimethyl sulfide in addition to acetaldehyde and  2- methyl propanol have been identified in cooked cauliflower.  Cauliflower seedlings are used for salad and  green.  The curd is used in curries,  soups, and pickles.  In abundant areas of  production, cauliflower curd is cut in to pieces, dried and preserved for  off-season use.  The therapeutic effect  of cauliflower has been well documented.   The inflorescence extract has been used in the treatment of scurvy, as a  blood purifier and as an antacid.  The  seeds have contraceptive properties.   Cauliflower extract has been reported to be effective in the inhibition  of initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis in <em>in vitro.</em> Potential  chemo preventive agents include ascorbic acid, carotenoids, tocopherols,  isothiocyanates, indoles and flavonoids.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Area  and Production</strong><br />
				  India  is the largest producer of cauliflower in the world.  Out of total 5335447 ha of land under  vegetables, cauliflower occupies nearly 4.4 per cent area under cauliflower  during the year 1998-99.  Production of  cauliflower was 4680600 tones during the year 1998-99.  The area, production and productivity of  cauliflower from 1987-88 to 1998-99 are given in Table 1.<br />

				<p>            Further, cauliflower varieties can  also be classified on the basis of maturity.   Most of the early Indian varieties of cauliflower are called by the name  of the month in which the curds are mature and become ready for harvest, <em>viz.,</em> ‘Kunwari (September-October maturity), Katki’ (October-November maturity),  ‘Agahani’ (November maturity), ‘Posi’ (December maturity), ‘Maghi’ (January  maturity).  Most of these varieties are  highly heterozygous for maturity, plant growth and curd traits.  The cultivars are classified into five groups  on the basis of curd maturity (Table 4).<br />

<strong>SWARNA</strong><br />
It  can be grown from September to December in plain and around the year in the  bills.  Curds are white, compact and  ready within 80-85 days after transplanting.   It yielded 1-2.5 kg on an average curd weight.<br />
<strong>SUMMER  KING</strong><br />
It  produces whitish round shaped curd and ready for harvesting with 65 days after  transplanting with 400-500 g an average curd weight.  It can be grown during summer season in  northern plain.<br />
<strong>Climatic  Requirements</strong> <br />
The  cauliflower has a wide range in adaptation to diverse climatic conditions,  prevailing in temperate subtropics and tropical parts and therefore, the  cultivation of cauliflower is wide spread in many countries of the world.  The optimum temperature for growth of young  plants is around 23oC, but in later stages 17-20oC are  most favourable.  The tropical cultivars  show growth even at 35oC.  In  temperate regions, the growth of young seedlings may be ceased, when  temperatures are slightly about OoC, while, the early cultivars  grown in plains of north India and other tropical parts can grow even at 35oC  or still higher temperature (Nieuwhof, 1969).   Lower temperatures ranging from 5oC to 28-30oC are  needed for transition from vegetative to curding phase.  The temperature higher or lower than the  optimum required for curd formation of the cultivars may cause physiological  disorder viz. riceyness, leafy curd and blindness.<br />
<strong>Soil  conditions</strong> <br />
Cauliflower  can be grown in all types of soil with good fertility and good regime.  In light soil, the plants are most sensitive  to drought and therefore, adequate moisture supply is important.  For early crops, the light soils are  preferred, while, loamy and clay loam soils are more suitable for mid season  and late maturing types.  Cauliflower is  relatively more sensitive to deficiency of boron and molybdenum, and it has  high requirement of magnesium.  The  deficiency of magnesium may quickly appears in acid soils.  High pH reduces the availability of boron.<br />
<strong>Sowing  Time </strong> <br />
The  optimum time of seed sowing in the nursery varies greatly depending upon  climate, varieties and their temperature requirement for curd formation.  The nursery for mid season crop can be grown  successfully by protection of beds from heavy rains during July-August is  essential.  The seedlings for mid late  and late crop can be conveniently raised, because of favourable temperature  conditions.  Depending upon curd maturity  of the varieties, the following sowing times have been recommended (Table 5).<br />

				<p><strong>Seed  Rate, Methods of Sowing and Transplanting Distance</strong><br />
				  For  cultivation of cauliflower in one hectare, 200-500 g seed would be needed,  though, in the early crops, the requirement may be more to the tune of 1  kg.  For raising nursery, the nursery  beds should be prepared by addition of well rotten farmyard manure or compost @  10 kg/m2.  The soil of the beds is made  friable by through digging / ploughing and harrowing and breaking the clods.  The sterilization of soil by drenching, the  nursery beds with formalin @ 1:49, about 15-20 days before seed sowing is  beneficial for preventing the attack of the fungal diseases.  After drenching, the beds should be kept  covered with polythene for a week and then beds are again dug and left open for  5-6 days.So that, there is no injurious effect of formalin to the seeds.  The nursery must be raised about 15 cm high  from ground surface for efficient drainage.   The sowing should be done in shallow furrows at 10 cm apart.  The depth of furrows may be 1.5-2 cm.  After sowing the seed, the furrows are  covered with a mixture of sieved fine manure and soil and the beds are gently  leveled at the surface.  The beds should  be covered with a proper mulching material like dry cane grass or polythene  before watering.  In the initial stage,  water is applied with a water cane over the grass mulch but in later stage when  plants are 15-20 days, old watering through furrows may be done.  However, the grass cover or polythene should  be removed as soon the emergence of seed sprouts.  The beds should also be covered and shaded  for protection against hot sunshine and rains especially in early season  nursery.  Weeding and intercultural of  nursery beds should be regularly done for raising healthy seedlings.  Generally, the seedlings are ready for  transplanting in 3-6 weeks after seed sowing, depending upon variety,  temperature and soil fertility.  In case  of early crop, 5-6 weeks old seedlings have better establishment and less  mortality in the field, while, in mid-season and late varieties 3-4 weeks old  seedlings may be transplanted.  The  planting distance may vary according to the variety, climate and soil.  Normally, the seedlings of early varieties  are planted to 60 cm row to row and 30-45 cm plant to plant distance.  The main season and late varieties are  planted at spacing of 60-75 cm between rows and 45-60 cm between plants.<img width="266" height="199" src="lec13_clip_image002_0000.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="Cauliflower young plant" /></p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Nutritional  Requirements and Their Management</strong> <br />
			    Manure  and fertilizer requirements in cauliflower are depend upon fertility status of  the soil, which is determined by soil testing is not possible, then 150-200  q/ha farmyard manure should be applied in the soil before 15-20 before  transplanting.  It should be mixed  thoroughly in the field.  The quantity of  nitrogen, phosphorous and potash should be given after determining the  fertility status of soil.  However,  research carried out under All India coordinated Vegetable Improvement Project  for different state of the India; following recommendations for quantity of  nitrogen phosphorous and potash have been given (Anon, 2000).</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>A  dose of 40 kg N/ha as basal + 40 kg N/ha as top dressing + 30 kg N/ha as foliar  spray ahs been recommended for variety Snowball-16 under Sabour  conditions.  However, for Pantnagar  conditions, 60 kg N/ha as basal + 30 kg as foliar spray in three splits has  been recommended for the same variety.   Further, at Kalyanpur, the best response was 60 kg N/ha as basal + 60 kg  N/ha as top dressing in two equal splits.</li>
				  <li>Application  of 150 kg N/ha + 120 kg P2O3 per hectare has been  recommended for obtaining economic yield under Kalyanpur conditions.</li>
				  <li>For  variety Pant Shubra, recommendation of 100 kg N, 60 kg P2O3  and 60 kg K2O per hectare has been recommended for Faizabad  conditions.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>In  addition to NPK, borax @ 15 kg/ha and ammonium molybdate @ 15 kg/ha should also  be applied in deficient soil of boron and molybdenum, respectively.  Half doses of nitrogen and full doses of each  phosphorus and potash are applied at the time of transplanting.  Remaining quantity of nitrogen is applied  30-35 days after transplanting.<br />
                    <strong>Intercultural  Operations</strong><br />
			    The  intercultural operations should be done regularly to keep the crop free from  weeds and aeration of the root system.   Hoeing should not be deep to avoid injury to the roots.  Usually, in medium heavy and clay soils,  there are crust penetration in root system are hindered, which affect plant  growth.  During rainy season, the roots  of plants in ridge planting maybe exposed, which requires adequate earthing.  When earthing or ridging is done, the side  dressing of nitrogenous fertilizer should also be done for healthy growth of  the crop.  In commercial weed control,  basalin @ 2-3 kg a.i/ha + 1.2 hand weeding or tenoran 50 WP @ 1 kg a.i. /ha can  be used.</p>

                         In  cauliflower, for getting quality curd, blanching is an important operation to  protect the curds from yellowing due to direct exposure to sum.  The curds may also loose some of their  flavour, because of this exposure.  This  problem generally occurs in such varieties of early and mid season maturity  group, which have spreading and open plant type.  In some varieties, the curd remains naturally  protected and surrounded by inner whorls of leaves.  These are called self-blanching types.  Drawing and tying the tips of leaves when  curds are fully developed may do the blanching.   The other way to place a leaf a cauliflower over the curd 4-5 days prior  to harvest.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Water  Management</strong> <br />
				  First  irrigation is given just after transplanting.   Further irrigation will depend upon weather, soil type and variety.  However, regular maintenance of optimum  moisture supply is essential during both growth and curd development  stage.  For early and mid season crop,  usually, lesser number of irrigation is needed because of rains.  In areas having rainfall, the planting is  done on ridges, furrow irrigation should be given.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting,  Yield and Storage</strong><br />
				  The  harvesting is done as soon as the curd attains right maturity and they are  compact, with white colour of the curds is maintained, If the harvesting is  delayed, the curds become over mature, whose quality is deteriorated.  Such curds may turn loose, leafy, ricey or  fuzzy.  The over mature curds should be  sorted out while sending the produce to market.   For harvesting, the curds are cut off stalk well below the curd with a  sharp cutting knife or sickle Yield of the cauliflower varies greatly depending  upon variety, maturity group and season.   Early maturing cultivars have an average yield of 80-120 /ha.  The main season cauliflower produces 150-200  q yield/ha. while Snowball group and other late maturing cultivars gave the  highest yield of 250-300 q/ha, because of highly compact curds and larger plant  population per unit area.  Cauliflower  can be stored successfully at 0oC and 90-95 per cent RH for 2-4  weeks (Hardenburgs et al., 1990).<br />
  <strong>Diseases,  Pests and Physiological Disorders</strong><br />
  <strong>Diseases</strong><br />
				  Most  of the diseases, which affect cauliflower, are similar to diseases of  cabbage.  However, some specific diseases  of cauliflower are described below:<br />
  <strong>Stalk  Rot (<em>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum </em>(Lib) De Bary)</strong><br />
				  Leaves  when infected, turn light green and alter yellow and shed prematurely.  Black soft rot later often appears on  petioles and mid rib touching.  The soil  is covered with flubby growth of fungus.   Stem on the ground levels show girdling.   Cool (20-25oC) and 95-100 per cent conditions are ideal for  disease initiation and spread (Sharma and Sharma, 1985).</p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Control  Measures</strong><br />
				  Crop  rotation is highly effective in decreasing disease incidence (Gupta <em>et al.</em> 1986).  Application of benlate (0.02%)  and MBC (0.02%) have found to be effective in reducing disease incidence  (Sharma and Sharma, 1985).<br />
  <strong> Insect-Pests  </strong><br />
				  All  the insect-pests, which damage cabbage, are also harmful to cauliflower and  fallow same control measures.<br />
  <strong>Physiological  Disorder</strong><br />
				  Cauliflower  suffers from a number of physiological disorders, which manifest in different  type of disease syndromes.  Some  physiological disorders depend mainly on hereditary factor, whereas, other are  fluctuation occurring in temperature, air, water, humidity, organic and  inorganic nutrition.  Important  physiological disorders, affecting cauliflower are described below:<br />
  <strong>Riceyness</strong><br />
				  It  manifests in the elongation on peduncle wearing flower buds, rendering curds,  granular, loose and somewhat velvety.  A  premature initiation of floral bud is characterized by riceyness in cauliflower  and is considered to be of poor quality for marketing.  At IARI, New Delhi, it has been found that  this disorder may result from any temperature higher or lower than the optimum  required for particular cultivars.   Riceyness mainly and harvesting has been delayed.  If late variety planted early, riceyness  develops due to the prevalent of high temperature, however, if can also appear  at lower temperature.  Hereditary factors  have also been reported for riceyness.   Heavy dose of nitrogen and high relative humidity also contributes to  riceyness.  It can be controlled by  cultivation of genetically pure seed and appropriate varieties with recommended  cultural practices.<br />
  <strong>Fuzziness</strong><br />
				  It  appears as the flower pedicels of velvety curds elongate.  The anomaly is both hereditary and  non-hereditary.  Cultivation of  cauliflower, out of their normal season encourages fuzziness. Sowing good  quality seed in right season under proper cultural practices, minimized  fuzziness.<br />
  <strong>Leafiness</strong><br />
				  This  disorder is commonly seen by formation of small thin leaves from the curd which  reduces quality of curd.  Extremely small  green leaves appear in between the curd segment due to inheritable or  non-heritable factors.  Prevalence of  high temperatures during curding phase aggravates leafiness.  Certain varieties are more sensitive to  leafiness or bracketing than other.  It  can be controlled by selection of varieties according to their adaptability.<br />
  <strong>Browning  (Brown Rot or Red Rot)</strong><br />
				  It  is caused by borne deficiency which is influenced by soil pH.  The availability of boron decreases at  neutral soil reaction.  It is  characterized by sign on the young leaves that become dark green and  brittle.  The old leaves puckered,  chlorotic and often drops off.   Sometimes, the downward curling of older leaves followed by development  of blisters when boron deficiency is severe.   The leaves remain small and the growing point may die.  However, in later stage, water soaked, light  brown to dark brown spots formed on the stem and branches may ultimately lead  to the formation of cavities formed on the stem and branches may ultimately  lead to the formation of cavities and a hollow stem.  Curds may also show irregular water soaked  spots.  Which alter change to a rusty  brown colour. The affected curds remain small and acquire a bitter taste.  This may be controlled by application of  borax or sodium borate or sodium tetra borate at the rate of 20 kg/ha a soil  application.  In case of acute  deficiency, spray of 0.25 to 0.50 per cent solution of borax at the rate of 1  to 2 kg/ha depending upon growth, soil reaction and extent of deficiency.<br />
  <strong>Whiptail</strong><br />
				  Deficiency  of molybdenum causes ‘whiptail’ syndrome, especially, in highly acidic  soils.  Because high manganese  concentrations in such soils hinder the uptake of molybdenum which seldom  occurs when the soil pH is 5.5 or higher.   The young cauliflower plants become chlorotic and may turn white,  particularly along the leaf margins.   They also become cupped and wither.   The leaves blades fail to develop properly, and the leaves are ruffled  and distorted.  In older plant, the  lamina of the newly formed leaves are irregular in shape, frequently,  consisting of only a large bare midribs and hence, the common name  “whiptail”.  It can be corrected by  application of lime or dolomite limestone to raise the soil pH up to 6.5 or  higher.  Sodium or Ammonium molybdate at  the rate of 1-2 kg/ha as soil application can also control “whiptail” of  cauliflower.</p>

        <p><strong>Buttoning</strong><br />
  Development  of small curds with inadequate foliage in cauliflower is known as  buttoning.  It is also referred to as  premature heading.  The leaves are so  small that can not cover the formed head.   Causes of buttoning are (i) Transplanting of more than 6 week-old  seedlings.  Generally, over aged  seedlings when transplanted in the field take more time in establishment due to  less developed root system.  A poor  development of root system is possible due to insufficient availability for  nutrients and inadequate space for the development of root system due to  crowding of seedlings, allowed for longer duration in the nursery beds.  The growth rate of such over aged seedlings  is usually slow.  Not only this they  could not put on optimum vegetative growth and start forming curds, which  further could not grow into normal size and causes buttoning.  Temperature below the optimum during growing  period delays maturity. (ii) Planting as early variety in late vice versa leads  buttoning. (iii) Hot and dry weather is unfavorable for vegetative growth of  plants, but favourable for inducing curd formation and inhibits further  enlargement.  Curds remain very small in  size like buttons. (iv)When soil moisture becomes limiting factor, it checks  the growth of the plants, which in turn, causes early formation of curds checks  the growth of the plants, which in turn, causes early formation of curds  without maintaining their further enlargement. (v) Transplanting of seedlings,  obtained from poorly managed nursery bed.   Such seedlings may not have high potential for their vegetative growth,  which is almost important for the formation and enlargement of normal curds.  (vi) Slow plant growth in the nursery, over crowding, insufficient water, lack  of weeding, bad condition of the soil, excessive crowding, insufficient water,  lack of weeding, bad condition of the soil, excessive salt concentrations, low  lying area or field with shallow and poor top salt may also cause buttoning.  (vii) Vigorously grown nursery plants with thickened stems and sessile foliage  being already generative have a tendency of button formation in the field.  The check in growth may be caused by root  injury by insects or by some diseases (especially <em>Rhizoctonia spp.</em>).  It can be controlled by (i) Nursery should be  properly look after to avoid any check in the plant growth.  (ii) An adequate amount of nitrogen and water  should be applied. (iii) Do not delay transplanting and (IV) Cultural practices  should be carried out well in time and water logging and overcrowding should be  avoided.<br />
                  <strong>Blindness</strong><br />
				  It  means the plant without terminal buds or when the growing point collapse at an  early stage and the terminal buds fails to develop and plant becomes blind.  It occurs in over wintered plants and any  practice interfering in growth of the terminal bud may lead to blindness.  Plant grows without terminal bud and fails to  form and curd.  It is characterized by  the leaves that develop are large, dark green, thick and leathery owing to the  accumulation of carbohydrates.   Sometimes, the axillary bud develops but the plant fails to produce a  marketable curd.  The main cause of  blindness are low temperature when plants are small and when damage occurs to  the terminal bud during, handling of the plants or injury by insect-pests.  It can be controlled by avoiding young plant  from low temperature exposure and care seedlings.  While planting and handling, seedlings are  avoided damage from insect-pests.<br />
                  <strong>Chlorosis</strong><br />
				  In  cauliflower magnesium deficiency causes chlorosis when grown on highly acidic  soils.  Chlorosis shows on interveinal  and yellow mottling of lower leaves.  The  affected leaves turn bronze in colour and become stiff.  In severely deficient plants, abscission of  the lower leaves occurs and results into small curd formation.  It can be controlled by applying magnesium  oxide @ 300 kg/ha, liming the soil with dolomite limestone to bring the soil pH  to 6.5 are an effective control measure.Use of a fertilizer containing soluble  magnesium, keeps it under control.<br />
                  <strong>Hollow  Stem</strong><br />
				  It  may be due to boron deficiency and higher supply of nitrogen nutrition.  Hollowness caused by boron may be identified  by water soaked and discoloured tissue, whereas, hollowness caused by nitrogen,  the stem is perfectively clear while with no sign of disintegration.  It can be controlled by spraying of borax at  0.1 to 0.3 or soil application of borax @ 15-20 kg/ha. If hollow stem is used  by boron deficiency. However, for normal type of hollowness, spacing the plants  closer together or by reducing the fertilizer doses.<br />
                  <strong>Frost  Injury</strong><br />
				  In  cauliflower, leaves of young seedling turn yellowish-white on both the  surfaces.  Petioles become flaccid and  white, midrib along with adjacent parenchyma and stem may also be injured.  Fully grown curds of cauliflower are more  sensitive to frost damage, than the smaller ones.  However, in cabbage the younger leaves are  particularly sensitive to frost, as that the centre of the heads turns brown,  while, outwardly the head appears healthy, similar symptoms also occurs in  Brussels sprouts.  It can be minimized by  irrigating the field on anticipating the danger of frost and by raising the  field temperature by creating smoke.<br />
                  <strong>Pinking</strong><br />
				  Sometimes  curds show pink tinge, this appears due to the exposure of curds to high light  intensities.  Under this condition,  anthocyanin form and gives rise pink colour curds.  This disorder is not so common.<br />
