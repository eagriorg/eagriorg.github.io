			    <p>Onion  is valued for its bulbs having characteristic odour, flavour and pungency,  which is due to the presence of a volatile oil – allyl-propyl-disulphide.  Pungency is formed by enzymatic reaction when  tissues are broken.  Bulbs are suited for  storage for a long period and for long distance transport.  It is used as salad and cooked in many ways  in curries, fried, boiled, baked and used in making soups, pickles etc.  Value addition in onion is done by marketing  dehydrated onions and onion flakes.   Onion bulb is rich in minerals like phosphorus (50 mg / 100 g) and  calcium (180 mg / 100 g).  Many medicinal  uses are reported for bulbs and is commonly used as diuretic and applied on  wounds and boils.  Onion greens are also  used by harvesting crop at pencil thickness and when small bulb is formed.<br />
				  India  is the second largest producer of onion in the world, next to China and ranks  third in export of onions, next to Netherlands and Spain.  During 2001-2002, a total of 52.52 lakh  metric tones of bulbs was produced from an area of 4.96 lakh hectares in  India.  Maharashtra is the leading onion  producing state in India followed by Karnataka and Gujarat. The crop is grown  on extensive scale in Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu,  Rajasthan and Bihar.<br />
  <strong>Origin  and taxonomy</strong><br />
				  Onion  originated in Asia.  According to Vavilov  (1951), onion originated in Pakistan.   Jones and Mann (1963) proposed the area comprising Pakistan, Iran and  mountain areas to the North as primary centre of origin of onion.<br />
				  The  following types of onions are grown in India:</p>

				<p><strong>Botany</strong><br />
				  Onion  is a biennial herb with a characteristic smell.   The leaves are tubular and the bulbs are formed by the attachment of  swollen leaf bases to underground part of stem which is small and  rudimentary.  Flowers are produced during  second phase after formation of bulbs.   Flowering structure is called an ‘umbel’, which is an aggregate of many  small inflorescences (cymes) of 5-10 flowers.   Length of peduncle commonly known a ‘scape’ varies with variety.  Though individual flowers are hermaphrodite,  they are cross pollinated due to protandry.   Cross pollination is achieved by honey bees when they visit flowers for  nectar.  Stigma becomes receptive 3-4  days after shedding of pollen grains.   Artificial selfing is done by covering all umbels of a plant together  and by shaking or rubbing each other or by introducing flies.<br />
                  <strong>Male  sterility</strong><br />
			    Jones  and Clarke (1943) reported male sterility formed by interaction of nuclear gene  and cytoplasmic factor.  It is presumed  that there are two types of cytoplasm – normal (N) and sterile (S).  All male sterile plants have ‘S’ cytoplasm  which is inherited maternally through egg.   A recessive gene ‘ms’ in homozygous condition results in sterile pollen  grains when carried in plants with ‘S’ cytoplasm [S(msms)].  Plants with ‘N’ cytoplasm  [N(MsMs)], N(MsMs), N(msms) and plants with  genetic constitution S (MsMs) and S (Msms) are fertile.  Besides modifier genes, environmental factors  also cause variation in expression of male sterility.</p>
				Male  sterile plants ([S (ms ms)] are usually designated as ‘A line’.  They can be maintained by crossing with male  fertile ‘B line’ having fertile cytoplasm – N (msms).  B line can be identified by crossing ‘A line’  with several other lines and if the progeny turns out to be completely male  sterile in a particular case, that particular parent will be considered as B  line with N (msms).  Fertility of ‘A  line’ can be maintained by crossing with ‘C line’ having a
<p>constitution of N (Msms) as pollen  parent.  Progeny segregates in the ratio  of 1 male sterile: 1 male fertile.  ‘C  line’ is generally designated as fertility restorer line.<br />
  <strong>Climate</strong><br />
            Onion  is a cool season vegetable and grows well under mild climate without extreme  heat or cold or excessive rainfall.  It  does not thrive when the average rainfall exceeds 75-100 cm during monsoon  period.  The young seedlings withstand  freezing temperature.  The ideal  temperature for vegetative growth is 12.8 – 23.0oC.  For bulb formation it requires long days and  still higher temperature (20-25oC).   Even though onion is treated as a long day plant, for bulb formation and  its development, varieties differ in their response to length of day.  Most of cultivars grown in plains of North  India are short day cultivars.  Long day  varieties will not produce bulbs under short day conditions and short day  cultivars if planted under long day conditions will develop early bulbs.  For seed production, temperature has more  relevance than photoperiod.<br />
<strong>Varieties</strong><br />
            Onion  varieties differ in size, colour of skin, pungency, and maturation etc. of  bulbs.  Large sized bulbs are mild in  pungency and are sweet in taste compared to small sized onions.  Red coloured cultivars are more pungent than  silver skinned varieties and keep better in storage.  Yellow cultivars have less demand in the  market.  The local cultivars are known  and marketed after the names of places where they are grown.  Poona Red, Nasik Red, Bellary Red, Patna Red  and Patna White are common in onion trade.<br />
            Most  of the improved varieties were developed through mass selection from local  collections of segregating populations.   A brief description of improved varieties is given below:</p>

                    <strong>Hybrid  vigour</strong><br />
				  IIHR,  Bangalore has developed F1 hybrids like Arka Kirtiman, Arka Lalima  and Arka Pitamber.  A brief description  of the above hybrids is given below :</p>
				<p align="center"><strong>Arka  Kirtiman<em> - </em></strong>F1  hybrid of CMS 65 x Selection 13-1-1.   Suitable for kharif and rabi seasons, bulbs medium size and dark red,  yield 45-60 t/ha, good keeping quality, suitable for export to Gulf countries.<br />
                  <strong>Arka  Lalima<em> – </em></strong>F1  hybrid of MS 48 x Selection 14-1-1, bulbs globe shaped an deep red each  weighing 120-130 g, good shelf life of 5 months, tolerant to purple blotch,  suitable for export to Gulf countries.<br />
                  <strong>Arka  Pitamber (IIHR Yellow) – </strong>Short day variety with globe shaped  yellow bulbs, average bulb weight 80 g, moderately resistant to purple blotch,  yield 35-38 t/ha.<br />
                  <strong>Soil</strong><br />
                              Onion prefers a well drained, loose  and friable soil rich in humus.  It is  sensitive to high acidity and alkalinity and the ideal pH is 5.8 to 6.5.<img width="287" height="214" src="lec15_clip_image002.gif" align="middle" hspace="12" /></p>
				<p><strong>Methods  of planting</strong><br />
			    The  following three methods of planting are followed depending on soil, topography,  climatic conditions and economic aspects: </p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Raising       seedlings and transplanting</li>
				  <li>Planting       bulbs directly in the field.</li>
				  <li>Broadcasting       or drilling of seeds directly in the field.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Transplanting  method</strong><br />
				  This  is the most common method practiced for irrigated crop as it results in high  yield and large size bulbs.  In plains,  seeds are sown during October-November for a Rabi crop.  In hills, seeds are sown from March to  June.  Seeds are first sown in well  prepared nursery beds of 90-120 cm width, 7.5-10.0 cm height and convenient  length.  Raito between nursery area and  main field is about 1:20.  Seed rate  varies from 8 to 10 kg/ha.  Seedlings of  15 cm height and 0.8 cm neck diameter are ideal for transplanting and this is  achieved in 8 weeks.  However, it varies  from 6-10 weeks depending on soil, climate and receipt of rain.  There is a practice of topping seedlings at  the time of transplanting if seedlings are over-grown.<br />
				  For  transplanting, the land is brought to a fine tilth by thorough ploughing,  leveling and breaking clods.  The field  is then divided into small plots of convenient sizes for irrigation and  seedlings are transplanted at 15 x 8-10 cm spacing.<br />
  <strong>Planting  of bulbs</strong><br />
				  This  method is practiced in hill slope and in terrace cultivation since seedlings  are easily washed off in rain.  Medium to  small sized bulbs alone are used for plating since large sized bulbs result in  early bolting and high cost.  Medium sized  bulbs obtained from a seedling planted June crop are used for planting in  September – October after giving a month rest.   Bulbs are dibbled at 15 cm apart on the side of 45 cm wide ridges or in  beds or in furrows depending on soil or climate.  10-12 quintals of bulbs are required to plant  one hectare.<br />
  <strong>Broadcasting  or drilling method</strong><br />
				  Direct  sowing by broadcasting or drilling at 30 cm apart is practiced in some areas to  save labour for transplanting.  Here seed  requirement is as high as 25 kg / ha.  Care  should be taken to remove weeds during initial stages to prevent smothering of  seedlings by weeds.  Usually weeding is  done at 10 days interval for the first 1-2 months.  When bulbs are 6-8 weeks old, seedlings  should be thinned to proper distance which usually synchronizes with gap  filling.<br />
  <strong>Manures  and fertilizers</strong><br />
				  Onion  is a heavy feeder of nitrogen and potash and a crop yielding 35 t/ha requires  120 kg N, 50 kg P2O5 and 160 kg K2O, 15 kg Mg  O and 20 kg sulphur.  Apply 20-25 tones  of farmyard manure at the time of first ploughing so that it may get mixed  thoroughly during subsequent ploughings.   Entire dose of P and K should be applied at the time of final land  preparation.  Nitrogen should be  top-dressed in two equal splits, first half 3-4 weeks after transplanting and  second half two months after transplanting.<br />
  <strong>Application  of fertilizers in Tamil Nadu :  </strong><br />
				  Apply FYM 25 t/ha, <em>Azospirillum </em>2 kg and <em>Phosphobacteria </em>2 kg/ha, N 30 kg, P 60  kg and K 30 kg/ha as basal and 30 kg N/ha on 30th day of sowing.<br />
  <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
				  Onion  is mainly grown as a irrigated crop in India.   Frequency of irrigation depends on soil and climatic conditions.  Requirement of water varies with stages of  crop.  It requires less water immediately  after establishment of seedlings and consumption goes on increasing with  maximum requirement before maturity, around 3 months after transplanting, and  thereafter it is reduced.  So irrigate  the crop at 13-15 days interval during early stage followed by subsequent  irrigations at 7-10 days interval.<br />
  <strong>Weeding  and inter-culture</strong><br />
				  During  early stages of the crop, plants grow slowly and it is essential to remove  weeds.  Pre-plant incorporation of  Basalin (2 kg a.i./ha) along with one hand weeding at 45 days after  transplanting is recommended to control weeds.   Being a shallow rooted crop, deep inter-culture operation is likely to  injure roots and reduce yield.  Generally  two hoeings are essential for making soil loose and to cover bulbs.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting  and yield</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Onion is ready  for harvest in 3-5 months after transplanting depending on variety.  Harvesting is done by pulling out plants when  tops are drooping but still green.   During hot days when soil is hard, bulbs are pulled out with a  hand-hoe.  Yield varies with season and  variety.  15-25 tonnes of bulbs are expected  from one hectare of transplanted crop.   Yield of kharif crop is comparatively low.<br />
  <strong>Rainy  season onion cultivation</strong><br />
				  Onion  was grown during rabi season only.   Development of varieties suitable for rainy season is a significant  achievement in onion breeding and it resulted in cultivation of onion in kharif  season also.  Varieties like N-53,  Agrifound Dark Red, Baswant 780 and Arka Kalyan are suitable for growing in  rainy season.  For a successful crop,  seeds are sown by end of May or June, transplanted in August and harvested in  December-January.  In kharif season,  yield will be less and ranges from 15-20 t/ha.<br />
  <strong>Green  onion or Spring onion</strong><br />
				  Consumption  of green onion is almost equal to that of dry onion in the world.  Both bulb-forming and non-bulb forming types  are used as green onion.  For green onion  production, seeds are sown in August, transplanted in October and harvested  after 75-80 days at tender stage.   Varieties like early Grano, Pusa White Flat and Pusa White Round are  suitable for green onion purposes.  Yield  ranges from 40-45 t/ha.<br />
  <strong>Post-harvest  handling</strong><br />
				  It  is estimated that 60-65% of onion produced in India is consumed internally, 5%  exported and 30-40% lost by post harvest damage.<br />
  <strong>Curing</strong><br />
				  Sprouting  and rotting are common problems in storage since bulbs contain high  moisture.  The bulbs should be adequately  cured for proper development of skin colour and to remove field heat before  storage of bulbs.  It is done till the  neck is tight and outer scales are dried.   This will prevent infection of diseases and minimize shrinkage  loss.  Bulbs are cured either in field or  in open shade or by artificial means before storage.  During kharif season, bulbs are cured for 2-3  weeks along with top.  In rabi, bulbs are  cured in field for 3-5 days; tops are cut leaving 2.0-2.5 cm above bulb and  again cured for 7-10 days to remove field heat.<br />
  <strong>Storage</strong><br />
				  After  curing, bulbs are stored in well ventilated rooms by spreading them on dry and  damp proof floorings or on racks.   Periodical turning of bulbs and removal of rotten and sprouted bulbs is  highly essential.  A pre-harvest spray of  maleic hydrazide (2000-2500 ppm) prevents rotting and sprouting of bulbs stored  at room temperature.  At BARC, Trombay  irradiation of bulbs with very low doses (4000-9000 krads) of gamma rays is  effective for preventing sprouting and enhancing storage life of onion bulbs.<br />
				  Bulbs  harvested from kharif crop do not store well for long period.  At 0-2-2.2oC under cold storage,  bulbs can be stored for long period.   NHRDF and NAFED erected storage structures in Nasik for helping  farmers.  Three types of storage  structures, viz., Panipat type 2-tiered, 3-tier onion store and 2-tier model  were established by Government itself investing heavily.<br />
  <strong>Grading</strong><br />
				  These  necked, bolted and decayed bulbs are removed. Cured bulbs are graded based on  size, and depending on market to which it is sent.  Big sized onion is in demand in New Delhi,  medium sized in Kolkata, Patna and small sized onion in North Eastern regions  of the country.<br />
  <strong>Marketing</strong><br />
				  Between  farmers and consumers, several intermediaries are involved in marketing of  onions.  After entry of NAFED in onion  trade, farmers’ co-operatives are playing a key role in marketing.  Lasalgoan is the biggest onion market in  India.  November – June is the peak period  of onion in market.<br />
  <strong>Export</strong><br />
				  India  is the third biggest exporter of onion, next to Netherlands and Spain, in  world.  Major export is to Gulf  countries, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.  Export of onion is channelised through  NAFED.  Depending on preference of colour  and size of bulbs, different varieties are exported.  Middle East countries prefer light red to  dark red bulbs.  In Malaysia preference  is for dark red bulbs.  In America and  Japan, demand is for yellowish or brown onion having mild pungency.  Europe and Japan markets prefer large sized  bulbs while in Singapore, demand is for small onions.<br />
				  Onion accounts for major share  (nearly 75%) of vegetables exported from India.   Export of 4.4 lakh tones of fresh onion worth of Rs. 332.43 crores  during 2001-02 was increased to 8.33 lakh tones worth of Rs. 621.09 crores  during 2004-05.  During 2004-05 share of  fresh onion export was 3.8% of the total export earning from agriculture  sector.  Major importers for Indian onion  are Bangladesh, Malaysia, UAE and Sri Lanka.   About 90% of export from India is of big onion (4-6 cm diameter) and 10%  of small onion (3-4 cm diameter) and multiplier onion.  Large onion exported to Malaysia, Gulf  countries, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh etc. and small and multiplier onion  to Bangladesh, Singapore and Malaysia.   Colour preference also varies with the country.  Middle East countries demand light red to  dark red, Malaysia dark red, Sri Lanka dark red to light red and Bangladesh  small onion of light red to dark red.   European countries, Japan and America prefer yellowish or brown onions  having mild pungency.<strong></strong><br />
  <strong>Dehydrated  onion</strong><br />
				  Popularity  of dehydrated onion is increasing now-a-days.   Advantages of dehydrated onion are storage stability and ease of  preparation.  Commercial processing  plants prescribes a shrinkage ratio of 7:1 to 17:1 with a moisture content of  4% in final product.  Dehydrated onions  are sold in many forms as slices, chopped, minced, granulated and powdered.<br />
  <strong>            Bulbs for dehydration should have  the following characteristics:</strong></p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Devoid       of any green patches so that it may not develop discoloration on       drying.  White onions are preferred       to red or yellow onions.</li>
				  <li>TSS       should be 15-20o Brix in common onion and 25oBrix in       multiplier onion.</li>
				  <li>Onion       with small neck and root zone and those with tall globe shape are       preferred than flat types to permit greater efficiency in topping.</li>
				  <li>Large       bulbs are preferred due to economy in harvests.</li>
				  <li>Pungency       should be high since dehydrated product is primarily sued as flavouring       agent.</li>
				  <li>The       bulb should have good stability with minimum shrinkage loss and       rotting.  Moisture content should be       around 80%.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>South Port White Globe and White  Cresole are primarily used for dehydration in Central California and Central  America.  Varieties like Pusa White Red,  Pusa White Flat, S-48 and N-257-9-1 and Udaipur-102 are suitable for  dehydration purposes.<br />
                    <strong>Seed  Production</strong><br />
				  Onion  is a cross-pollinated crop and isolation distance of 1000-1600 m and 500 m is  recommended for production of foundation and certified seeds,  respectively.  Two methods of seed  production are followed-seed to seed method and bulb to seed method.  Even though seed yield is more under seed to  seed method, bulb to seed method is followed for production of quality seeds.<br />
				  In  bulb to seed method, bulbs are produced as for market and bulbs with desired  quality are replanted for seed production.   Bulbs are replanted in first fortnight of October.  Normally medium sized bulbs of 2.5 to 3.0 cm  diameter are planted on the side of ridges or on beds at 45 x 30-45 cm  spacing.  1000 kg bulb is required to  plant one hectare. Flower stalks will be produced during third month after  planting of bulbs and seeds ripen within six weeks after formation of flower  clusters.  Heads are harvested when seeds  turn black in colour, but before seeds are shed.  Seeds are dried in well ventilated rooms  under shade and are stored.  Seed yield  is 800 – 1000 kg / ha.<br />
				  Seed  production of varieties which do not store well in storage is done by seed to  seed method. </p>

                <p align="center"><strong>Multiplier Onion</strong><br />
                    <strong>(Syn : Aggregatum onion)</strong><br />
                    <strong>(<em>Allium cepa </em>var. </strong><strong><em>Aggregatum</em></strong><strong>) (2n = 2x =  16)</strong><br />
                  (Hindi : Cotta  pyas)<br />
                <p>Multiplier  onion is used mainly for seasoning of curries.   Unlike common onion, it is propagated through bulb-lets.  The small bulbs grows into large ones which  again break into smaller ones.<br />
                  Unlike  common onion, multiplier onion comes up well under tropical condition with  sufficient soil moisture.  Heavy rain  during germination and bulb formation stage is highly deleterious for the crop.  It prefers well drained loamy soil.<br />
  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
                  The  Tamil Nadu Agricultural University developed four varieties viz., Co.1, Co.2,  Co.3, Co.4 and CO On 5 and NHRDF, Dindigul one variety – Agrifound Red.  A brief description of the varieties is given  below:<br />
                  CO.1  – Bulbs large and pink, 7-9 bulbs / clump, yield 9-10 t/ha in 85 days.<br />
                  CO.2  – Bulbs large and crimson, 7-9 bulbs / clump, yield 12 t/ha in 65-70 days.<br />
                  CO.3  – Bulbs pink with a weight of 75 g, 8-10 bulbs / plant, moderately resistant to  thrips, good storage quality, yield 15.8 t/ha in 65 days.<br />
                  CO.4  – Bulks attractive light pink, 9-13 bulbs / plant.  Average weight 90 g/lump.  Yield 19 t/ha in 65 days.<br />
                  COOn 5 - High bulb yield (18.91  t/ha), free flowering and high seed setting <br />
                  ability, propagation through seeds.<br />
                  Agrifound  Red - Each clump weights 65 g with 5-6 light red bulb-lets, TSS 15-16oB, yield  18-20 t/ha in 65 days.<br />
                  Under  Tamil Nadu condition, bulbs are planted during April-May.  As in common onion, field is ploughed to fine  tilth and ridges and furrows are prepared at 45 cm apart.  Medium sized bulbs are planted at a distance  of 10 cm on either side of ridges.  1500  kg of bulbs are required to plant one hectare.   As in common, seedlings raised from seeds are also used for  planting.  Cultural practices are same as  in common onion.  Yield varies from 10-15  t/ha with a crop duration of 2-3 months.<br />
