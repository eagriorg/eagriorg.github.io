				  (<em>Cuminum cyminum</em>, Apiaceae)<strong></strong></p>
                <p><img src="lec06_clip_image002.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="274" hspace="12" align="left" /> Cumin, commonly  known as Jeera, (<em>Cuminum cyminum</em>)  belongs to Apiaceae family, widely cultivated in Gujarat, Rajasthan and in some  parts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh as Rabi crop. Cumin is mainly used in  flavouring foods. It is also used in Ayurvedic medicines.<br />
                  <strong>Climate and soil</strong> <br />
                  Cumin is a tropical plant. It grows well in sub-tropical  climate too. High humidity during flowering &amp; fruit set, causes fungal  diseases in this crop. Cumin can be cultivated in all types of soils but well  drained sandy loam and medium soils are suitable for the crop.<br />
  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
                  Improved varieties  like S-404, MC-43, Gujarat Cumin-1(GC-1), GC-2, GC-3, RS-1, UC-198, RZ-19,  etc., evolved by Agricultural Universities of Gujarat and Rajasthan having  higher yield potential are useful for cultivation. The maturity days are 110 to  115 days depending on variety.<br />
  <strong>Botany</strong><br />

                <p><strong>Sowing and Seed rate</strong><br />
                  Sowing is done from 1st week of November to 1st week of  December by broadcasting or in rows drilled at 30 cm. Seed rate vary from 12 to  15 kg / ha, depending upon method of sowing &amp; type of soil. Sowing of seeds  should be done at a depth of 1 – 2 cm after treatment with Ceresan or thiram or  Difoltan @ 3.0 g per kg. Soaking of seeds for 8 hours before sowing is helpful  in getting good germination. Soaked seeds should be dried in shade to  facilitate broadcasting. Sowing at higher depths, affect the germination of  seeds adversely. Crop rotation should be followed to avoid incidence of pest  and diseases.<br />
                  <strong>Land  preparation</strong><br />
                  Soil is brought to  fine tilth by 2-3 ploughings with harrow or deshi plough. Stubbles of previous  crops should be collected and removed from the field. Clods should be broken  and field should be leveled with the help of plank. Beds of 4 m x 3 m size with  provision of irrigation channels should be prepared before sowing of seeds to  facilitate proper irrigation and intercultural operations. <br />
  <strong>Manures &amp; Fertilizers</strong><br />
                  15  – 20 MT FYM, 30 kg Nitrogen &amp; 15 kg Phosphorus per ha is recommended for  cumin crop. Whole quantity of FYM should be mixed into the soil at the time of  land preparation and 15 kg Nitrogen &amp; whole quantity of Phosphorus should  be applied as basal dose. Another, 15 kg Nitrogen should be applied as  topdressing one month after germination of seeds. <br />
  <strong>Weeding</strong><br />
                  The crop should be  kept free from weeds for proper growth and development of plants. Generally 2-3  hand weeding are required to keep the weeds under check. In drilled crop light  intercultural operation is beneficial. 1st weeding and hoeing should be done  after 30-40 days from the date of sowing. <br />
  <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
                  Based on type of  soil, crop requires 4-6 irrigation. 1st light irrigation should be given  immediately after sowing and second irrigation should be given after 6-10 days  from 1st irrigation. Subsequent irrigations should be given after 30, 45, 65  and 80 days from 1st irrigation. Irrigation at the time of flowering and fruit  set are essential. At maturity stage irrigation should be stopped.<br />
  <strong>Plant Protection</strong><br />
  <strong>Aphid</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Aphid is a major pest of  cumin crop, it sucks the sap of tender parts and reduces the yield. Spraying of  0.03% solution of Dimethoate or 0.025% solution of Methyl demeton or 0.04%  solution of Monocrotophos is recommended to control the aphid. <br />
  <strong>Leaf eating Caterpillar</strong> <br />
                  This pest causes damage to the foliage of plants reducing  yield of the crop. It can be controlled by spraying of 0.02% solution of  Phosphomidon in the early stage of crop. <br />
  <strong>b) Diseases</strong> <br />
  <strong>Fusarium wilt</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Infected plants show peculiar  symptoms of dropping of tips and leaves, leading to mortality of the entire  plant. Attack of wilt is severe in younger plants. There is no chemical control  for this disease. Crop rotation and use of Neem cake are helpful in checking  spread of the fungus vis-à-vis disease. Seeds collected from disease free plots  should only be used for sowing.<br />
  <strong>Alternaria Blight</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong> The blight affected plants show very minute  brownish necrotic spots, which later turn to blackish. Mostly diseased plants  fail to produce seeds. If seeds are produced they remain shriveled, light in  weight and dark in colour. For the control of this disease seed treatment and  spraying of 0.2% solution of Dithane-M-45 4 times at 10 days interval  commencing from 40 days after sowing is recommended. Add 1 ml soap solution /  liter water for better efficiency of fungicide. The crop should be kept free  from weeds. Crops requiring more irrigation and mustard crop should not be  grown in vicinity of this crop.<br />
  <strong>Powdery mildew</strong> <br />
                  Affected plants in early stages show minute whitish spots  on leaves, petiole, stem pedicel and seeds. In severe condition, it looks as  the plants have been dusted with white powder. At later stages of attack seeds  become white and shriveled and light in weight. Crop should be dusted with 300  mesh Sulphur dust @ 25 kg/ha to control this disease as soon as the symptoms  are noticed. Spraying of wettable Sulphur or Dinocap (Karathane or Thiowet) can  also be used to control the disease @ 20-25 g per 10 liter of water at the  initial stage of this disease. If needed second spray should be given 15-20 day  after first spray.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting</strong><br />
                  Generally cumin crop takes about 110-115 days to reach  maturity. Crop becomes ready to harvest, when plants turn yellowish brown.  Harvesting should be done early in the morning by cutting/uprooting the whole  plants. Harvested crop should be dried in the threshing yard thrashed to  separate the seeds. Seeds should be cleaned by winnowing. <br />
                  <strong>Yield:</strong>  600 to 700 kg/h <br />
