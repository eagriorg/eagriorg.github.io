            The coconut palm, <em>Cocus nucifera </em>L., is one of the most  beautiful and useful palms in the world. It provides a variety of useful  products like food, fuel and timber. Every part of the tree is being utilized  for some purpose or other and hence, it is called Kalpavriksha meaning tree of  heaven which provides all the necessities of life. It is grown in India in  about 1.51 million ha. With an annual production of about 9283.4 million nuts.  It ranks third in world in area and production, first and second being  Indonesia and Philippines respectively. Among the different coconut growing  states in India, Kerala, Tamilnadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh account for  nearly 90persent in area and production.</p>

                <p>            Among  the Southern States though Tamil Nadu has share in area (92, 14,200 ha), its  share in production is due to the higher productivity per palm.<br />
                  <strong>Botany</strong><br />
                  Origin of coconut  is believed to be somewhere in South East Asia. Coconut, botanically <em>Cocas nucifera </em>has only one species  under the genus Cocus. It is a tall stately unbranched palm growing to a height  of 12m to 24m. The stem is marked by rings of leaf scars which are often not  prominent at the base. The palm has an adventitious root system, having  numerous thick roots from the base of the stem almost throughout its life. The  roots are localized generally at the lower most region of the stem which has  been termed the bole.  Leaves are large,  long, pinnately sect, borne on the crown. The palm is monoecious with  relatively few female flowers. Male flowers are numerous small with six stamens  and in female flowers, the ovary is tricarpic, usually one ovuled.<br />
  <strong></strong>Fruit is large, one seed drupe. The outer layers of the pericarp  are thick and fibrous. The inner layer (endocarp of shell) is very hard, horny  or stony and the thin testa cohering to the endocarp is lined with white  albuminous endosperm (meat), enclosing a large cavity, partially filled with  sweet fluid. The inflorescence develops within a strong, tough pointed double  sheath called spathe which after full developed splits along its underside from  top to bottom and releases the inflorescence. This usually occurs from 75-95  days after the first appearance of its tip in the leaf axil. The primordial of  the inflorescence begin to form the leaf axil about 32 months before the  opening of the spathe. In bearing coconut palm every leaf axil can produce a  spadix and under normal conditions it varies from 12-15 per annum. However,  this number may be reduced due to adverse weather condition.<br />
                  In  India, the female flower production is high during the period from March- May  and low from September – January. In general, the number of female per  inflorescence varies from 10-50. Female flowers normally become receptive 19-20  days after the opening of the spathe. Genetically the dwarf palms are  autogamous while tall types allogamous. Both winds and insects are considered  to be the main pollinating agents. A large number of buttons (female flowers)  fail to develop due to lack of pollination and fertilization, defect in the  flowers, physiological disorders, genetic nature of the variety, pests and  disease and unfavorable environment etc.   Generally, not more than 2 to 40% of the female flowers reach maturity  under normal conditions. <br />
  <strong>Climate  and soil</strong><br />
                  The coconut palm  is found to grow under varying climate and soil condition. It is essentially a  tropical plant, growing mostly between 20 N and 20 S latitudes. Near the  equator, productive coconut plantation can be established up to the elevation  of about 1000m from sea level while the further one goes from the equator, the  more is the palm confined to lowlands. The palms tolerate wide range in  intensity and distribution of rainfall. However a rainfall of about 200cm per  year and well distributed throughout the year is the best proper growth and  maximum yield. In areas of inadequate rainfall with uneven distribution,  irrigation is required. Soil moisture deficit during summer hampers nut  production to greater extent. Palm requires plenty of sunlight and odes not  grow well under shade. Coconut is adaptable to a wide range of soil conditions,  from light sandy soils to heaviest clays with a pH ranging from 5.2 to 8.0.  Best soils are deep, friable, loamy soils. In heavier soils, it requires good  drainage. </p>
                <h1><a name="_Toc129579531" id="_Toc129579531">Cultivars and Hybrids</a></h1>
                <p>            Coconut  palms are broadly classified into two groups, the tall and dwarf. The tall  cultivars are the common type that occurs throughout the world. The different  cultivars of the Tall are known by the place where they are largely cultivated.  The tall cultivars largely grown in India are the West Coast Tall and East  Coast Tall.<br />
                  <strong></strong>The dwarf varieties are shorter in stature and life span as  compared to Talls. They start bearing earlier compared to Talls. The size of  the nuts and the quality of copra are inferior to Talls. The Dwarf cultivars  occur with three nut colours viz. green, yellow, and orange. The dwarf  cultivars are generally grown for tender nuts and also for hybrid production.  The common dwarfs available in India are Chawghat Orange Dwarf, Chawghat Green  Dwarf, Malayan Green Dwarf, Malayan Yellow Dwarf, Malayan Orange Dwarf,  Gangabondam etc.<br />
                  The  hybrids between Tall and Dwarf forms (TxD) or vice Versa (DxT) show hybrid  vigour for growth, earliness and yield. Hence, hybrids have been released  recently for cultivation. The important cultivars and hybrids recommended now  for cultivation are given below:<br />
  <strong>TALLS</strong><br />
  <strong>West Coast Tall (WCT): </strong>It  is a common tall cultivar, cultivated through out the West Coast region because  of its commercial importance, high copra yield (115 to 180 g /nut) and high  quality in terms of  high oil content (70  to 72%). WCT is a hardy palm, yields economically ranging from 50 to 100 nuts  /palm /year (mean of 70 nuts under rainfed condition) for about 60 to75 years.  It is one of the best indigenous types grown from very ancient times in India.  The nuts are varying in shape, medium in size with colour varying from green,  yellow to brown; varying in husk and kernel content also. This cultivar  commences to yield in about 6 to 8 years after planting under favourable  conditions. The mean yield of nuts is positively correlated with both annual  outturn of copra and oil; whereas it is negatively correlated with mean copra  content per nut.<br />
  <strong>East Coast Tall (ECT): </strong>It  is a common tall cultivar. The time taken for flowering is 72.9 months. ECT is  a hardy palm, yields economically ranging from 73 nuts /palm /year. The average  weight of copra is around 125g.The oil content is around 64%.<br />
  <strong>Laccadive Ordinary (Chandrakalpa): </strong>It  is a native of Lakshadweep, similar to West Coast Tall in almost all  characters, except for the prominent ridges on the triangular nuts and the  average yield is comparatively high, 120 nuts /palm /year (range 90 to 180).  This type is recommended for commercial cultivation in the country because of  high quantity and quality of copra production. About 6200 nuts are required to  make one tone of copra. The performance of Laccadive Ordinary has been found to  be good in most of the coconut growing states in India; it gave the highest  yield of copra /palm at Pilicode (Kerala) and Arsikere (Karnataka); while it  gave maximum number of nuts /palm at Ratnagiri (Maharastra) and Ambajipeta  (Andhra Pradesh) research stations.<br />
  <strong>HYBRIDS</strong><br />
  <strong>Chandra Sankara: </strong>Chawghat  Orange Dwarf X West Coast Tall,    It is a  hybrid. The time taken for flowering is 60 months. On an average a tree of this  hybrid can yield 116 nuts/palm/year. The average weight of copra is 215g and  oil content is around 68%.<br />
  <strong>ChandraLaksha: </strong>Laccadive  Ordinary X Chawghat Orange Dwarf: It is a hybrid. The time taken for flowering  is 48 months. On an average a tree of this hybrid can yield 109 nuts/palm/year.  The average weight of copra is 195g and oil content is around 69%.<br />
  <strong>Laksha Ganga: </strong>Laccadive  Ordinary X Gangabondam: It is a hybrid. The time taken for flowering is 60  months. On an average a tree of this hybrid can yield 108 nuts/palm/year. The  average weight of copra is 195g and oil content is around 70%.<br />
  <strong>Keraganga:  </strong>West Coast Tall x Gangabondam:<strong> </strong>Five  years for flowering, 100 nuts per tree, 201g copra, 69% oil content.<strong></strong><br />
  <strong>Anantha ganga: </strong>Andaman  Ordinary X Gangabondam:<strong> </strong>Five years for flowering, 95 nuts per tree, 216g  copra, 68% oil content.<strong></strong></p>
                <h2><a name="_Toc129579532" id="_Toc129579532">Varieties released by TNAU, Coconut Research Center –  Veppankulam</a></h2>

                  <strong>Production  of Coconut Seedlings</strong><br />
                  Since  coconut cultivation involves substantial pre-bearing investment, greater  emphasis must be given for the selection of the right type of planting material.  Quality seed nuts and seedlings are obtained through a series of selections  made at various stages.<br />
                <strong>1.  Selection of seed gardens</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>The  garden should have palms with record consistently high yields and high  proportion of heavy bearers.</li>
                  <li>They  should not be located under favourable environment.</li>
                  <li>They  should be free from disease and pests.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>2.   Selection of mother plants</strong><br />
                  In order to raise coconut seedlings of  superior quality, the selection of mother palm should be done prior to taking  seed nuts. The following points may be taken into case of while selecting  mother palms.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>The palm should be strong, stout and  growing straight.</li>
                  <li>Leaf  scars on the palms should be closely spaced.</li>
                  <li>The  palms should be regular bearer with annual yield of more than 80 nuts and copra  contents not less than 150 g per nut.</li>
                  <li>Palms  should have reached full bearing stage and have been giving consistently high  yields for atleast four years.</li>
                  <li>Palms  of above 60 years should be avoided.</li>
                  <li>Palms  should have atleast 30 fully opened leaves on the crown</li>
                  <li>The  leaves should have short strong petioles with wide leaf base firmly attached to  the stem. Their arrangement should provide support to the bunches.</li>
                  <li>Each  leaf axil should have one inflorescence with large number of spikes and one or  two female flowers per spike.</li>
                  <li>Bunch  stalk should be short stout and strong.</li>
                  <li>Palms  should have medium sized nuts (about 1200 g dry weight / nut) with round and  oblong shape. Husked be large (about 570 g) with thick kernels.</li>
                  <li>Palms,  which produce barren nuts or those shedding large number of nuts in the  immature stage, should be discarded.                </li>
                </ol>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>3. Selection of seed nut</strong><br />
                  For raising seedlings, it is important  to collect seed nuts of high quality from the selected mother palms. The  selected nuts can be stored under dry and cool places for about 3-4 months  without deteriorating their viability. The following points should be  considered while selecting seed nuts.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Collect seed nuts from February - May</li>
                  <li>Harvest  only fully matured nuts (11-12 months old)</li>
                  <li>Nuts  should not be damaged while harvesting</li>
                  <li>Discard  the nuts having irregular shape, size and improper development</li>
                  <li>Select  seed nuts of uniform size with thin husk weighing above 100 g. </li>
                  <li>Selected  seed nuts should float on water vertically. The content of copra should be more  than 150 g.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>4. Raising of seedlings</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Select site with well drained coarse  textured soil near dependable water source</li>
                  <li>Prepare  the raised beds to avoid of water stagnation during rainy season</li>
                  <li>Sandy  soil is the best for raising seedlings on large scale</li>
                  <li>If  the soil is not sandy, treat the soil with lidane as a precaution against white  grub and termites. </li>
                  Nursery can be  raised either in open with artificial shade or in gardens where the trees are  tall and the ground is not completely shaded.</li>
                  <li>The  seed nuts should be sown in long and narrow beds at a spacing of 40 x 30 cm  during May-June in 20-25 cm deep trenches. However the length and width of  nursery beds should be kept as per ones convenience.</li>
                  <li>The  seed nuts with less nut water and seed nuts of dwarf cultivars may be sown  horizontally to ensure early germination. Discard nuts in which water has  dried.</li>
                  <li>Before  sowing it is advisable to dip seed nuts in suspension of Lindane (400 g in 100  litres of water) as an additional precaution against white grub and termites.</li>
                </ol>

                  Prior to transplanting  selection of seedlings is utmost important. The following points will help in  selection of superior quality seedlings</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Select early germinated seedlings</li>
                  <li>Select  seedlings which show early splitting, short petiole and broad leaves</li>
                  <li>Select  seedlings which are ready for transplanting in 9-12 months</li>
                  <li>Select  seedlings with well developed root system</li>
                  <li>Select  seedlings having thick and short collar region</li>
                </ol>

                  The  depth of pits will depend upon the soil type. Normally a pit size of 1.0 X 1.0  X 1.0 m is dug and filled up to 50 cm depth with sand and powdered cow dung.  However, when the water table is high, planting at the surface or even on  mounds may be necessary but digging pits and filling has to be done.<br />
  <strong>System  of planting</strong><br />

                <p>      In  well-drained soil, seedlings can be transplanted with the beginning of  south-west monsoon. If irrigated facilities are available, it is advisable to  take up planting at least a month before the monsoon sets in so that the  seedling get well established before the onset of heavy rains.<br />
                  <strong>Care of young palms</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                  Young  palms require good care in the early of growth. The transplanted seedling  should be shaded and irrigated properly especially during the summer months.  Provision of proper drainage is also equally important in areas subject to  water logging. The pits should be cleared of weeds periodically.   Soil washed down by the rains and covering  the collar of the seedlings should also be removed. The pits should be  gradually filled up as the seedlings grow. <br />
  <strong>Manuring</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                  As  coconut yields throughout the year it takes heavy amount of nutrients from soil  especially N, K and Cl. Therefore, regular Manuring from  the first year of planting is essential to ensure good vegetative growth, early  flowering and   bearing and high yields.  The fertilizer requirements of different coconut growing states are given  below:</p>

                  The  first application of fertilizers should be done three months after planting  (nearly 1/10th above dose) while during the second year, one- third of the  dosage recommended for adult palm may be applied in two splits doses and during  the third year, 2/3 of the dosages recommended for adult palm may be applied  and from the fourth year onwards, the full dose recommended may be applied.  After the receipt of summer showers, 1/3 of the recommended dose of fertilizers  for a year may be spread around the palms within a radius of 1.8 m and forked  in. the remaining 2/3 of recommended dose of fertilizer may be spread over 50  kg of the green leaf or compost per palm in circular basins of 1.8 m radius and  25 cm depth during September / October and the basins covered.<br />
  <strong>Irrigation and soil moisture  conservation</strong><strong>   </strong><br />
  <img src="lec14_clip_image012.jpg" alt="" width="229" height="174" hspace="12" align="left" />       The  coconut palm responds to summer irrigation. Production of female flowers and  setting percentage increases considerably due to irrigation. Since spadix  initiation to ripening of nuts takes nearly 42 months, the full benefit of  irrigation can be felt only after three years. Under West Coast conditions, 2  cm irrigation once in 4-5 days during December to May is beneficial in sandy  loam soils. In areas where water is scare, drip irrigation system can be  adopted. This requires only 30 liters of water per day per palm is against 200  liters per palm in conventional irrigation.<br />
  <img src="lec14_clip_image014.jpg" alt="" width="229" height="157" hspace="12" align="left" />       Burying  the coconut husk or coir dust is one of the most effective ways of conserving  soil moisture. These husks are coir dust can act as sponge and absorb and  retain moisture about six and times respectively to their own weight and slowly  release to the coconut periods during dry periods. As the husk or dust breaks  down slowly, their effect will last for 4 to 6 years and 8 to 10 years  respectively. On decomposition they also add K to soil. These husks and dusts can be add in pits or trenches  taken in between the trees but in all the cases the depth should be 0.6 m and  1.8 m away from the bole. Husks or dusts can be added in alternate layers with  soil.<br />
  <strong>Intercultivation</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                  Regular  Intercultivation is very essential to step up and maintain the production at a  high level. Tillage operations like digging the garden with spade, ploughing,  forming small mounds before the end of monsoon and making shallow basins with a  radius of about 2 m at the beginning of monsoon and filling up at the close of  monsoon are beneficial to the trees. Method of Intercultivation will depend  upon local conditions, availability of labour, size of holding, soil type,  topography and distribution of rainfall. Cover cropping is recommended where  inter and mixed cropping is followed to prevent soil erosion in coconut  gardens. Leguminous crops such as <em>Mimosa invisa</em>, <em>Stylosanthes  gracilis</em> and <em>Calapogonium mucunoides</em> are generally recommended. Green  manure crops like sun hemp (<em>Crotalaria juncea</em>) and Kolinji (<em>Tephrosia purpurea</em>) are also raised and ploughing in during Aug-Sep. These crops can be  sown in APRIL- MAY when pre-monsoon showers are received.    <br />
                  <strong>Inter and mixed cropping</strong> <br />

                <p> In  pure coconut garden when palms are spacing at 7.5 x 7.5 as much as 75% of the  available area is not effective utilized. Besides, a pure coconut grooves  utilize only half of the available light. Hence, a variety of intercrops like  pineapple, banana, groundnut, chillies, sweet potato and tapioca can be raised  in coconut gardens after the palm attaining the height of 5-6 m. In older  plantations cocoa, pepper, cinnamon, clove and nutmeg can be grown as mixed  crop. in places where rainfall is not well distributed, irrigation may be  necessary during summer months. </p>
                <p>       However,  these crops are to be adequately, separately manured in addition to the manures  applied to the coconut palm. Mixed farming by raising fodder grasses such as  hybrid Napier grass, guinea grass along with leguminous fodder crops such as <em>Stylosanthes grasilis</em>. Coconut gardens can support 4 –5  dairy animals. The cattle manure generated from the system when applied to  coconut gardens improves the soil fertility considerably. <br />

                  The adult beetle bores into  the unopened fronds and spathes. The attacked frond when fully opened shows  characteristic triangular cuts.<br />
  <strong>Control</strong><br />
                  1. Provide field sanitation to prevent breeding of beetles. <br />
                  2. Hook out the beetles from the attacked palms by using beetle  hook.<br />
                  3 The topmost three leaf axils around the spindle may be filled  with any of the following mixtures as a prophylactic measure: <br />
                  (a) Sevidol 8G 25 g + fine sand 200 g, which is to be done thrice  in a year in April-May, September-October and December-January. (b) Naphthalene  balls 10.5 g (approx. three balls) covered with fine sand, once in 45 days.<br />
                  4. Treat manure pits and other possible breeding sites with 0.01%  carbaryl on w/w basis. Treatment will have to be repeated every three months.<br />
                  5. Release Baculovirus oryctes infected adults @ of 10-15 / ha to  bring down the pest population.<br />
                  6. Inoculation of breeding sites with entomopathogenic fungus Metarrhizium  anisopliae (@ 5 x 1011 spores / ml) gives effective control.<br />
  <strong>Red palm weevil <em>(Rhyncophorus  ferrugineus)</em></strong><br />

                  1. Field sanitation should be given prime importance.<br />
                  2. Avoid making steps or any other injury on the tree trunks to  reduce the loci of infestation.<br />
                  3. Leaf axil filling as suggested in the case of rhinoceros beetle will be  useful against the red palm weevil also.<br />
                  4. When green leaves are cut from the palms, stumps of not less  than 120 cm may be left on the trees in order to prevent successful inward  movement of the grubs through the cut end.<br />
                  5. In attacked palms, observe for the bore- holes and seal them  except the top most one. Through the top most hole, pour 1% carbaryl or 0.2%  trichlorphon or 0.1% endosulfan suspension @ one litre per palm, using a  funnel.<br />
                  6. When the pest infestation is through the crown, clean the crown  and slowly pour the insecticidal suspension.<br />
                  7. As an alternative, apply 1% DDVP or aluminum phosphide (for  limited use only) one or two tablets per palm as a curative measure.<br />
                  8. Coconut log traps with fermenting toddy or pineapple or  sugarcane activated with yeast or molasses can be set in coconut plantation to  attract and trap the free floating population of red palm weevil. Incorporate  any of the insecticide to each trap to kill the weevils trapped.<br />
                  9. Use of pheromone trap for attracting and killing adult weevils  @ one trap per 2 ha.<br />

  <strong>Control</strong><br />
                  1. As a prophylactic measure, the first affected leaves may be cut  and burnt during the beginning of the summer season.<br />
                  2. Arrange for the release of larval / pupal parasitoids, Goniozus  nephantidis, Elasmus nephantidis (brown species) and Brachymeria nosatoi.<br />
                  3. When infestation is very severe and if the biocontrol is not  likely to be effective, sprays the undersurface of the fronds with dichlorvos  0.02%, Malathion 0.05%, quinalphos 0.05%, endosulfan 0.05% or phosalone 0.05%.<br />
                  Note: Application of the insecticides should be followed by  liberation of larval and pupal parasites from the 21st day.<br />
  <strong>Cockchafer beetle (<em>Leucopholis  coneophora</em>)</strong> <br />
  <strong>Symptoms</strong><br />
                  The soil  inhabiting white grubs cause damage to the roots of coconut palm. The attack is  common in sandy tracts. The infested palms turn pale yellow and there will be  considerable reduction in yield. <br />
  <strong>Control</strong><br />
                  1. Collection and destruction of adults during the monsoon period  from adjacent vegetation (in the evening).<br />
                  2. Plough or dig the infested soil synchronizing with pre-monsoon  showers.<br />
                  3. Treat the soil with phorate 10G @ 100 g/palm or drench with  chloropyriphos 0.04% suspension. The treatment should be given twice, first  during April-May after the receipt of pre-monsoon showers and second during the  month of September.<br />
                  Note: Wherever possible, light traps may be set up to attract and trap adult  beetles.<br />
  <strong>Coried bug (<em>Paradasynus  rostratus</em>)</strong><strong> </strong><br />
  <strong>Symptoms</strong><br />
                  The attacked  buttons become deformed with characteristic crevices on the husk below the  perianth with gum exudations and the tender nuts become barren.<br />
  <strong>Control</strong><br />
                  Apply 0.1%  carbaryl or endosulfan suspension on the newly opened inflorescence after the  receptive phase of the female flowers and spray the entire crown excluding the  leaves and older bunches.<br />
                  Note: The insecticide may be applied according to the severity of  infection in a need-based manner.<br />
  <strong>Coconut eriophyid mite (<em>Aceria  [Eriophyes] guerreronis</em>)</strong> <br />
                  Coconut eriophyid  mite, a recently introduced pest is spreading at an alarming rate in Kerala. It  is a microscopic worm like mite infesting young buttons colonizing under the  perianth.<br />
  <strong>Symptoms</strong><br />
                The earliest  symptom on 2-3 month old buttons is pale yellow triangular patches seen below  the perianth. Later, these patches become brown. Severely affected buttons may  fall. As the buttons grow, brown patches lead to black necrotic lesions with  longitudinal fissures on the husk. Uneven growth results in distortion and  stunting of nuts leading to reduction in copra yield. In severe cases, the  losses are compounded because the quality of fibre is reduced and distorted  nuts increase the labour requirements for dehusking. </p>

Apply 2% Neem oil + garlic emulsion or commercial Neem  formulation azardirachtin 0.004% (Neemazal T/S 1% @ 4 ml per litre of water) or  micronized wettable sulphur 0.4 % in the crown on young bunches. In large  coconut plantations, dicofol 0.1% can be applied after taking adequate  precautions. However, spraying of dicofol should be avoided in homesteads. When  rocker sprayer is used 1.0 to 1.5 litres of spray fluid per palm is required.  If a hand sprayer is used, the spray solution required may be about 500 to 750  ml. Spraying has to be done on second to seventh bunches from top avoiding un  pollinated inflorescence. <br />
                  Care should be  taken to see that spray fluid reaches the perianth region of third, fourth and  fifth bunches since these bunches harbour maximum number of mites. Three rounds  of spraying are recommended in a year viz., March-April before the onset of  southwest monsoon, in August-September during the dry spell between the  southwest and northeast monsoons and in December-January after the northeast  monsoon so that all the emerging bunches in the vulnerable stage receive one  round of spraying. Rational rotation of the above pesticides may be adopted to  avoid chances of resistance.<br />
  <strong>Preparation of Neem oil + garlic emulsion (2%)</strong> <br />
                  To prepare 10  litres of 2% Neem oil + garlic emulsion, 200 ml Neem oil, 200 g garlic and 50 g  ordinary bar soap are required. Slice the bar soap and dissolve in 500 ml  lukewarm water. Grind 200 g of garlic and take the extract in 300 ml of water.  Pour the 500 ml soap solution in 200 ml Neem oil slowly and stir vigorously to  get a good emulsion. Mix the garlic extract in the Neem oil + soap emulsion.  Dilute this 1 litre stock solution by adding 9 litres of water to get 10 litres  of 2 % Neem oil + garlic emulsion.<br />
                  As per the  recommendation of the National Level Steering Committee, a holistic approach  has to be adopted in the management of the coconut eriophyid mite. Hence, in  addition to the plant protection measures mentioned above, the following  measures can be adopted:<br />
                  1. Improving  nutrient status by applying organic manure at the rate of 50 kg and Neem cake 5  kg per palm per year.     <br />
                  Also apply the recommended dose of  fertilizers in two split applications. <br />
                  2. Growing compatible intercrops / mixed crops.<br />
                  3. Providing adequate irrigation.<br />
  <strong>Mealy bug</strong> <br />
  <strong>Symptoms</strong><br />
                  Mealy bugs infest  the unopened heartleaf and inflorescence. As a result, the leaves become highly  stunted, suppressed, deformed and present a crinkled appearance. It is often  confused with the leaf rot symptoms. The affected inflorescences are malformed  and do not open. Even if they open, they do not bear nuts. <br />
                  Button mealy bugs  colonize under the perianth lobes of tender nuts. Infested nuts harbouring  gravid mealy bugs remain on the spadix, which serve as inoculum for further  spread.<br />
  <strong>Control</strong><br />
                  Remove and  destroy all dried up inflorescence and unproductive buttons. Apply non-residual  phosphatic insecticides like dimethoate 0.1%, quinalphos 0.05 %, and fenthion  0.1% at the site of infestation.<br />
                  Neem garlic emulsion 2% applied on infested bunches checks button  mealy bugs.<br />
  <strong>Rodents</strong> <br />
                  Rats damage  tender nuts by forming characteristic holes. Shed nuts can be seen at the base  of the palm.<br />
  <strong>Control</strong><br />
                  1. Use warfarin-based wax blocks containing 0.025% active  ingredient at intervals of three months for reducing rodent population.<br />
                  2. Place wax blocks of 0.005% bromadiolone in coconut crown of the  infested palms at 3 to 4 days interval till the bait is no more consumed.<br />
  <strong>Disease management</strong> <br />
  <strong>Phytophthora diseases</strong> <br />
                  Phytophthora  palmivora has been found to affect seedlings and adult palms causing bud rot  and immature nut fall commonly known as mahali.<br />
  <strong>Bud rot </strong> <br />
  <strong>Symptoms</strong><br />
                  Palms of all age  are liable to be attacked but normally young palms are more susceptible,  particularly during monsoon when the temperature is low and humidity is very  high. In seedlings, the spear leaf turns pale and comes off with a gentle pull.  In adult palms, the first visible symptom is the colour change of the spear,  which becomes pale and breaks at the base and hangs down. The tender leaf base  and soft tissues of the crown rot into a slimy mass of decayed material  emitting a foul smell. The rotting slowly progresses downwards, finally  affecting the meristem and killing the palms. This is accompanied by drooping  of successive leaves. Even then, nuts that are retained on the palm may grow to  maturity. The disease proves fatal if not checked at the early stages, before  damage of the bud.<br />
  <img src="lec14_clip_image032.gif" alt="" width="293" height="209" /></p>
                <p><strong>Management</strong><br />
                  1. In early stages of the disease (when the heartleaf starts  withering) cut and remove all affected tissues of the crown. Apply Bordeaux  paste and protect it from rain till normal shoot emerges.<br />
                  2. Burn all disease-affected tissues removed from the palm.<br />
                  3. Spray 1% Bordeaux mixture on spindle leaves and crown of  disease affected as well as neighboring palms, as a prophylactic measure. Palms  that are sensitive to copper containing fungicides can be protected by  mancozeb. Small, perforated sachets containing 2 g of mancozeb may be tied to  the top of leaf axil. When it rains, a small quantity of the fungicide is  released from the sachets to the leaf base, thus protecting the palm.<br />
                  4. Adopt control measures for rhinoceros beetle.<br />
                  5. Provide adequate drainage in gardens.<br />
                  6. Adopt proper spacing and avoid over crowding in bud rot prone  gardens.<br />
  <strong>Mahali</strong> <br />
  <strong>Symptoms</strong><br />
                  Shedding of  female flowers and immature nuts are the common symptoms of the disease.  Lesions appear on the young fruits or buttons near the stalk, which later lead  to the decay of the underlying tissues and endosperm.<br />
  <strong>Control</strong><br />
                  Spray 1% Bordeaux  mixture or copper oxychloride preparation (0.5%) on the crown of palms, once  before the monsoon and once or twice later on at intervals of 40 days.<br />
  <strong>Root (wilt) disease</strong> <br />
  <strong>Symptoms</strong><br />
                  The  characteristic symptom is the flaccidity of leaflets. Yellowing of older  leaves, necrosis of leaflets and deterioration and decay of root system are  other salient features of the disease. The leaflets curve inwardly to produce  ribbing so that the whole frond develops a cup like appearance. Abnormal  shedding of buttons and immature nuts are also noticed.<br />
  <strong>Management</strong><br />
                  Coconut root  (wilt) is a non-lethal debilitating disease and the affected palms survive for  a long period giving a reasonably good yield. The root (wilt) affected palms  are susceptible to diseases like leaf rot and pests like rhinoceros beetle and  red palm weevil. So there is a chance of confusing the pests and disease  symptom with the root (wilt) disease. Negligence on the management aspects  aggravates the malady. Efficient management of palms suspected to be affected  by coconut root (wilt) disease demands control of all pests and diseases and  imparting natural resistance and health to the palms through proper manuring  and agronomic practices. A package of management practices for the effective  management of root (wilt) disease is given below:<br />
                  1. Rogue out palms that are affected severely by root (wilt) and  yield less than 10 nuts / palm / year and those, which have contracted the  disease before flowering. Replant with disease tolerant material / high  yielding hybrids (Chandrasankara).<br />
                  2. Apply fertilizers for coconut palms in average management at  the rate of 0.34 kg N, 0.17 kg P2O5 and 0.68 kg K2O  / palm / year in the form of urea, rock phosphate and muriate of potash,  respectively. For palms under good management, fertilizers may be given @ of  0.5 kg N, 0.32 kg P2O5 and 1.2 kg K2O / palm /  year.<br />
                  3. In addition to the above, apply 50 kg cattle manure or green  manure and 1 kg of lime / palm / year. Magnesium may be supplied @ 500 g MgO  per palm per year in the Onattukara region (sandy soil) and 100 g MgO in the  remaining areas. The cheapest source of MgO is magnesite (MgCO3).  The magnesium in magnesite is acid soluble. Hence it may be preferred in acid  soils.<br />
                  4. Growing green manure crops like sun hemp, Sesbania, cowpea and  Calapogonium in the coconut basin and their incorporation in situ is beneficial  as the practice reduces the intensity of the root (wilt) and increases the nut  yield. The ideal green manure crops for the sandy and alluvial soils are cowpea  and Sesbania, respectively.<br />
                  5. Under rainfed conditions, apply fertilizers in two splits,  1/3rd at the time of early southwest monsoon and 2/3rd before the northeast  monsoon. Under irrigated conditions apply fertilizers in three equal splits  (April-May, August-September and December-January).<br />
                  6. Apply fertilizers and manures in 10 cm deep circular basins at a radius of 2  m from the bole of the palm.<br />
                  7. When the crop is grown under the bund and channel system, de  silt the channel and strengthen the bunds during summer months.<br />
                  8. Follow strictly all the prescribed prophylactic measures  against leaf rot disease, red palm weevil, rhinoceros beetle etc. so as to  ensure that the palms are not debilitated. To maintain the productivity of the  palms, prophylactic measures are of great importance.<br />
  <strong>Leaf rot</strong> <br />
  <strong>Symptoms </strong><br />
                  The first symptom  is the appearance of water-soaked brown lesions in the spear leaves of  root-wilt affected palms. Gradually these spots enlarge and coalesce resulting  in extensive rotting. As the leaf unfurls the rotten portions of the lamina dry  and get blown off in wind, giving a 'fan' shape to the leaves. Some times, the  symptom becomes very acute and the spear fails to unfurl.<br />
                  This disease is a  fungal complex initiated predominantly by <strong><em>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Exserohilum  rostratum and Fusarium spp.</em></strong><br />
  <strong>Management</strong><br />
                  1. Remove the rotten portions from the spear and the two adjacent  leaves.<br />
                  2. Pour 300 ml of fungicidal solution at the base of the spear.  This can be prepared by mixing hexaconazole 5 EC 2 ml or mancozeb 3 g in 300 ml  water.<br />
                  3. Treat the top two leaf axils with insecticide preparation. This  can be prepared by mixing phorate 10 G / sevidol / carbaryl 20 g with 200 g  sand.<br />
  <img src="lec14_clip_image034.jpg" alt="" width="178" height="216" hspace="12" align="left" />4. Spray crowns and leaves with 1% Bordeaux  mixture or 0.5% copper oxychloride formulations or 0.4% mancozeb in January,  April-May and September. While spraying, care has to be taken to spray the  spindle leaf.<br />
  <strong>Stem  bleeding</strong> <br />
  <strong>Symptoms</strong><br />
                  Exudation of the reddish brown  liquid through the growth cracks mostly at the basal part of the trunk and  bleeding patches higher up in the trunk are characteristic symptoms. One or  more lesions, lying close by, may coalesce to form large patches. The liquid  that oozes out dries up and turns black. The tissues beneath the bleeding  points decay and become yellowish. The lesions spread upwards as the disease  progresses. In advanced stages, the leaf size reduces leading to reduction in  crown size. The rate of leaf production slows down. The production of bunches  is affected and nut shedding takes place. The trunk gradually tapers towards  the apex. The progress of the disease is faster during July to November.<br />
  <strong>Causal  organism</strong> <br />
                  The fungus, <strong><em>Thielaviopsis paradoxa</em></strong> is  the causal agent. Growth cracks on the trunk, severe summer followed by heavy  down pour, water stagnation, and imbalance in nutrition, excess salinity and  stress can act as predisposing / aggravating factors.<br />
  <strong>Control</strong><br />
                  1.  Chisel out completely the affected tissues and paint the wound with tridemorph  5%. Apply coal tar after 1-2 days.<br />
                  2.  Destroy the chiseled materials by burning. Avoid any mechanical injury to  trunk.<br />
                  3.  Apply neem cake @ 5 kg per palm in the basin along with other organics.<br />
                  4.  Root feed with tridemorph 5%, thrice a year during April-May, September-October  and January-February to prevent further spread of lesions.<br />
                  5.  Apply tridemorph @ 25 ml in 25 litre of water as soil drenching once in four  months.<br />
  <strong>Grey  blight</strong> <br />
                  This is caused by the fungus <strong><em>Pestalotia  palmarum.</em></strong><br />
  <strong>Symptoms</strong><br />
                  Symptoms appear in the mature leaves  of the outer whorl as yellow specks encircled by a greyish band which later  become greyish white. The spots coalesce into irregular necrotic patches  causing extensive leaf blight. In advanced stages, the tips and margins of the  leaflets dry and shrivel giving a burnt appearance.<br />
  <strong>Control</strong><br />
                  Remove severely affected older leaves  and burn. Spray the trees with 1% Bordeaux mixture or propiconazole 0.3%.<br />
  <strong>Tanjore  wilt </strong><em>(</em><em>Ganoderma  lucidum)</em> <br />
  <strong>Symptoms</strong><br />
                  This disease is of recent occurrence  in many parts of Kerala, especially in the districts of Palakkad, Malappuram,  Thrissur, Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram and Wayanad. Middle aged palms were seen  fatally affected. The characteristic symptom of the disease is the rotting of  the basal portion of the stem. The bark turns brittle and often gets peeled off  in flakes, leaving open cracks and crevices. The internal tissues are  discoloured and disintegrated, emitting a bad smell. Mild bleeding occurs on  the basal region. The tissues on the bleeding spots are soft to touch.  Extensive damage of the root system following root rotting has been observed. Ultimately  the palm dies off.<br />
  <strong>Control</strong><br />
                  1.  Apply organic manure @ 50 kg / palm.<br />
                  2.  Apply neem cake @ 5 kg / palm / year.<br />
                  3.  Reduce fertilizer application to one-fourth of the recommended dose.<br />
                  4. Drench the basin with  40 litres of 1% Bordeaux mixture or tridemorph 0.1% or any other copper  fungicide to soak soil up to 15 cm depth at quarterly intervals.<br />
                  5. Root feed with  tridemorph 2 ml mixed with 100 ml water at quarterly intervals.<br />
                  6.  Avoid flood irrigation in order to prevent the possible spread of the pathogen  through soil.<br />
                  7.  Isolate the affected palm from the healthy ones by digging a trench of size 1 m  deep and 50 cm wide, 1.5 m away from the bole of the infected palm.<br />
                  8.  Avoid growing leguminous crops in and around the garden.<br />
  <strong>Button  shedding</strong> <br />
                  The shedding of buttons in the coconut is attributed to  the following reasons.<br />
                  1. Pathological conditions<br />
                  2. Attack of insect pests<br />
                  3. Nutritional deficiencies<br />
                  4. Soil and climatic variations<br />
                  5. Defects in pollination and fertilization<br />
                  6. Structural defects in the flower<br />
                  7. Abortion of embryos<br />
                  8. Limited capacity of the  tree to bear fruits<br />
                  9. Unfavourable conditions such as deficit of moisture, water logging and lack  of aeration.<br />
                  The causes of button shedding may be identified and appropriate remedial  measures adopted.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting</strong><br />
                  Fully  matured nuts, which can be recognized by shaking the nuts, should be alone  harvested to get the maximum yield of copra and oil. Frequent to harvest varies  from place to place. In any parts of Kerala harvesting done at 45 days interval  during summer months and at 60 days interval during rainy seasons. Hence 35% of  total nuts obtained during hot months i.e., from March- May and least crop is  obtained during rainy months. Harvested is done by climbing the tree.<br />
  <strong>Yield</strong><br />
                  It is  influenced by the Agro- climatic conditions, cultural practices such as  Manuring, irrigation, cropping system and control of pests and diseases etc. on  an average, a tall variety yielding 60 – 80 nuts per palm per year is  considered ideal. <br />
  <strong>VALUE ADDED PRODUCTS OF COCONUT</strong><br />
  <strong>Coconut Products</strong><br />
                  The  coconut products can be broadly classified into two categories, viz food  products and commercial products. Some of the important products have been  included in the following:<br />
  <strong>1. Food Products</strong><br />
  <strong>Wet meat or kernel</strong><br />
                  The  kernel or endosperm of the ripe coconut is an important food material in the  coconut growing areas. The gratings of the kernel are an essential ingredient  of common household dishes. The milk or cream obtained by squeezing the grated  kernel and diluted with water goes into many preparations.  It also serves as a base for the preparation  of various food products of commercial importance. As nut starts ripening, the  moisture, ash, protein and the sugar contents starts decreasing but fat content  increases.  The bottled coconut milk is  used as a substitute for cow’s milk and the coconut syrup is prepared out of  coconut milk, sugar and citric acid. Coconut milk is a rich source of  cytokinin.<br />
  <strong>Desiccated coconut</strong><br />
                It is the dried disintegrated coconut meat  of fully matured nuts which have been stored for a month before dehusking. This  state facilitates the subsequent dehusking operations because the kernel  detaches itself from the shell during the storage period. The dehusked nuts are  washed, sterilized, and desiccated at a temperature of 77° to 82° Celsius for  40-45 minutes.</p>
                <p><strong>Edible copra</strong><br />
                  Ball  copra is prepared out of fully matured (&gt;12 months old) nuts. The unhusked  nuts can be stored for about 8 –12 months and during this period the kernel  detaches itself the shell and gives a rattling sound, when it is shaken. In  another method, fully –matured nuts are dehusked and cut into two halves to  make cup copra. They are then   sun or  artificially dried and stored.<br />
  <strong>Coconut water</strong><br />
                  The  liquid endosperm of the tender coconut between the age group of 5-7 months  makes a refreshing drink during summer and also in the case of  gastroenteristis, diarrohea and against dehydration of tissues and to eliminate  poisonous substances through kidney.   Coconut water is also used as a’ culture media in various’  microbiological studies.<br />
  <strong>Toddy products</strong><br />
                  Toddy  is a sugar containing juice, obtained by tapping the unopened spadix. The  unopened spathe is bent and its 4-5cm length needs to be beaten everyday in  order to rupture the cells and induce the flow of sap. An earthen receptacle is  placed for the collection of sap. The flow of sap is slow in the beginning and  increases in the course. The shearing of the tip and beating of the  inflorescence is continued second till a spadix is also brought into  production. By this method on an average about 15 –18 litres of toddy is  extracted in one month.  The young palms  produce little toddy compared to older ones. Dwarf palms are highly suitable  for this purpose as it easy to tap them but the yield is lower than the tall  palms.<br />
                  Tapping  toddy increases the yield of poor bearers but decreases the copra content and  hence low oil content. Fresh toddy if not collected under sterilized condition,  rapidly gets fermented and the sugar turns into alcohol (5.8%). On  distillation, it yields strong liquor known as arrack.<br />
  <strong>2. COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS</strong><br />
  <strong>Milling Copra</strong><br />
                  Copra with moisture content of less than  6% and free from diseases and pests used for the production of oil referred as  milling copra. In conventional industry, the copra production destroys vitamin  E and sundried copra develops   <em>Aspergillus  flavus</em>    which on consumption  damages the liver.  Therefore, for oil  production, the ball copra which is well cured with less than 6% moisture is  used.<br />
  <strong>Coconut oil</strong><br />
                  The  traditional method of obtaining coconut oil through coconut crushing by  expeller’s leaves about 7-8% oil in the cake and all the proteins and  carbohydrates also go as animal feed. This expelled oil further requires  refining to lower free fatty acid (FFA) content for better flavour and colour.  Coconut oil is obtained by wet processing has more saturated fatty acids and  hence resistant to oxidative rancidity, but retains pleasing flavour when  refined easily digestible and stable in flavour. The virgin oil is crystal  clear and has full coconut fragrance. It retains vitamin E and develops no  aflatoxin due to elimination of intermediate copra drying step. It can directly  be used as hair oil or baby skin lotion. Because of lower FFA and moisture  contents, no flavour or colour develops and thus no refining is required. The  absence of protein and carbohydrate residues and haziness prolong its shelf  life. The consumption pattern of the coconut oil indicates that out of the  total oil produced, 50% is used as hair and skin oil, 35% for edible purposes  and the remaining 15% for industrial purpose.</p>
                <p><strong>White fibre or yarn fibre</strong><br />
                  It  is also  known as mat fibre and extracted  from green husks by bacteriological retting (husks are soaked in  water for 6-8 months).Usually 9-10 month old  nuts are used for the preparation of longest and finest yarns, which are in  turn made into ropes, mats, etc.<br />
  <strong>Coconut fibre (coir)</strong><br />
                  It   is an important product obtained from the  fruit husk. The fully matured (12-month old) nuts yield about 35 to 40 % coir.  Nuts of 11 months old have still higher coir content ranging from 50-55% while  in 9-12 months old nuts it is high as 70%.<br />
  <strong>Brown fibre</strong><br />
                  It  is produced from the husk of ripe dry nuts by extracting the fibre by  mechanical defibring process. It is of inferior quality.<br />
  <strong>Coconut water beverage</strong><br />
                  The  water phase of coconut with additives and formulations imparting tender coconut  water like taste renders this thirst- quenching hygienically packed beverage  suitable for serving. This was otherwise wasted and was effluent nuisance due  to BOD value in conventional plants.<br />
  <strong>Coconut shell</strong><br />
                  The  hard brown cover of the kernel shell is also used for the preparation of  charcoal, activated carbon and coconut shell powder. Coconut shell activated  carbon is best suited for deodorizing and decolouration of sugar syrup used in  soft drinks and coconut shell powder is also used in manufacture of cardboards. <br /></p>
