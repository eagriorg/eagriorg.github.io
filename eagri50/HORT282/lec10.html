				<p align="center"><strong>PALMAROSA  GRASS</strong><br />
				  (<em>Cymbopogon  martinii var.motia., Graminae)</em><br />
  <img src="lec10_clip_image002.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" hspace="12" align="left" />Oil of palmarosa, also known as Rusa or Rusha  or Rosha is the essential iii obtained from the aromatic grass <em> Cymbopogon  martinii var.motia. </em>The oil obtained from the other form viz. C. <em>martini.var.  sofia </em>is known as the ginger grass oil. Motia and sofia grasses are almost  identical and difficult to distinguish when they are in earlier growth stages.  Motia grass has fine yellow stem with dark green leaves and they attain a  height of 1.80 - 2.40 m. On the other  hand, sofia grass has purple stem, shorter (90-120 cm) than the motia grass.  These oils are used as base for the fine perfumery and are valued because of  their geraniol content. The oil is useful in imparting rose - like aroma to a  wide variety of soaps, tobacco products etc. The oil of palmarosa is  commercially preferred to ginger oil. </p>

				<p ><strong>Climate and Soil </strong><br />
				  Palmarosa  is a hardy plant and can grow in varying altitude right from sea level. It  stands well in places receiving rainfall from 75 cm to 150 cm. But it does not  withstand stagnant water. It requires exposed sunlight and does not perform  well under shady situations. <br />
				  Palmarosa  prefers a well drained soils of neutral to alkaline reaction and can be grown  in poor sandy <em>to </em>heavy-fertile  soils of arid tracts, saline soil conditions and also in marginal and sub  marginal lands. <br />
				  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
				  The  NBPGR has identified a superior selection viz. IW 31244 and RRL, Bhubaneswar  has identified two improved strains viz. RRL (B)- 77 and RRL(B)-71 for commercial  cultivation. A high yielding synthetic variety TRISHNA was developed by poly  cross progenies of four elite inbred by CIMAP Lucknow. This improved cultivar  registers 40% more oil yield and its geraniol content is as high as 93%. <br />
				  <strong>Land preparation </strong><br />
				  Nursery  bed should be prepared out of well pulverised soil and at a raised level. Leaf  mould or farm yard manure should be mixed well with the nursery bed. Seed rate  is 2.5 Kg per hectare. Best time for sowing is from April to September.  Seedlings become ready for transplanting when they are about 15 cm high. <br />
				  The  main field for raising palmarosa should be prepared by ploughing 3-4 times,  followed by forming ridges and furrows at 90 cm apart. The seedlings are  transplanted at 60 cm spacing in the ridges. In Kerala, a spacing of 45 x 30 cm  is followed but under Delhi condition, a closer spacing of 45 x 15 cm is found  to be good in producing higher herbage and oil yield. In North it is  recommended as a mixed crop along with Basil to get higher net profit from unit  area. <br />
				  <strong>Manures and fertilizers</strong><br />
				  It responds to application of compost. Under  North Eastern condition of India, a fertilizer dose of 60:40:40 NPK kg/ha is  followed while under Kerala condition, NPK dose of25, 50 and 25 Kglha is  recommended. Micronutrient like zinc (ZnS04 25 Kg /ha) is beneficial  to increase the oil yield of palmarosa. <br />
				  <strong>Harvesting </strong><br />
				  If  transplanting is done in May/June, the grass comes to first harvest after six  month from transplanting. Harvesting consists of cutting the upper third of the  stem along with the leaves. The right time for harvesting is when the plants  just begin to bloom as the leaves contain higher oil content during the  blooming period. Recent studies at NBPGR, Delhi shows that oil from the whole  plant is of good quality and economical to produce as per the table below. </p>

                  Besides,  superior quality of oil with roseousgreen odour is obtained at an early seed  setting stage rather than at full bloom stage when the oil yield is slightly  higher. <br />
                  The  grass yield more oil recovery if dried for nearly one week. The steam  distillation seems to be better than the other type of extraction. Palmarosa  yields 15 to 20 tonnes of herbage per ha in a year with an oil yield of 50-60  Kg per year. The plantation can be maintained for about 8 to 10 years, but the  oil yield starts declining from the fifth year. <br />
