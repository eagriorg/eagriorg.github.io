				  (<em>Cymbopogon winterianus, </em>Poaceae)<br />
  Citronella oil is an  essential oil containing citronellal, geraniol and hydroxy citronellol and  other high value perfumery bases obtained on steam distillation of citronella  grass. In Assam production of citronella oil has gone down from 450-500 MT/year  in 1986 to less than 100 MT/year mainly due to the following reasons:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Shift to tea cultivation  when tea price was remunerative</li>
                  <li>No technological up  gradation neither in varietal development nor in oil extraction techniques.</li>
                  <li>No quality monitoring as a  result of large-scale adulteration gave negative impact to the NE region’s  products.</li>
                  <li>Globalization in trading  resulting tough competition with China that produces quality products at lower  cost.</li>
                  <li>No extension support and  marketing networking.</li>
                  <li>Optimization of synthetic  equivalent derivatives from petrochemicals and turpentine that could partly  replace the derivatives ex-citronella oil.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><img src="lec09_clip_image002.jpg" alt="" width="285" height="211" hspace="12" align="left" /></p>
<p> However, its increasing applications in various fields  and gradual shift to natural from synthetic have changed the total scenario and  again the demand of natural source is increasing. Very high cost of production  in the past can be brought down by increasing yield per unit area/unit time and  by efficient steam distillation units.<br />
                  It may be estimated that the global demand could exceed  6500 MT/year replacing partly the synthetic equivalents. At present about 1800  MT is being produced in the world out of which India produces about 600  MT/year. Presently the major producers are China, Vietnam, Indonesia,  Argentina, Taiwan, Srilanka, Brazil, Madagascar and India. The oil is used for  perfuming soaps, detergents, cosmetics, agarbattis and for making mosquito  repellent creams. The oil is also used to isolate citronellol, geraniol. These  are in turn converted into citronellal, hydroxy citronellal, synthetic menthol  and esters of geraniol and citronellol. These compounds are used for making  high grade blended perfumes. Extension of high yielding and high citronellal  rich variety is need of the hour and can create big market. The crop grown in  NE region is aldehyde rich therefore; it may regain its lost image in the  global market.<br />
  <strong>Soil and climate</strong><br />
                  Citronella grows well in Assam where there is abundant  sunshine and high humidity (70 % and above). Temperature range between 200C to  380C and well-distributed rainfall of 2000-3000 mm are desirable but if  irrigation is available citronella can be cultivated in regions of low rainfall  also (rain shadow belt).<br />
                  Citronella grows best in sandy loam soils. Heavy clayey  soils, which tend to water log and light sandy soils are not suitable for this  crop. It does not tolerate water stagnation. A good amount of organic matter is  desirable. The ideal pH range is 5.0-7.0. Soil testing is important for best  fertility management and higher productivity.<br />
  <strong>Land preparation</strong><br />
  <strong>             </strong>The land is prepared to  fine tilth. Organic, P and K fertilizers are mixed into the soil at this stage.  In plains ridges are made at 45 cm apart. Apply at last ploughing 25-30 tons  FYM or well decomposed crowding and mixed with the soil. At this time 1.25 kg  Semazine or 1.25 kg Diuron in 1250-1500 litre water or 625 g Oxyflorofen or any  suitable pre-emergence herbicide<strong> </strong>may be applied at least 15 days before  planting.<br />
  <strong>Preparation of slips</strong><br />
                  Citronella is propagated by splitting the clumps of  vigorously growing plant of 6-months to one year old into slips. The clump is  gently dug out and separated into number of slips containing 2- 3 tillers/slip.  The fibrous roots and leaves are trimmed off at 25 – 30 cm height before  planting. One-year-old clump on an average, gives about 50 slips.<br />
  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
                  Jor lab C-2 released by RRL, Jorhat is recommended. It is  advisable to procure breeder material for multiplication from RRL, Jorhat or  diseased free material from any dependable sources. For Brahmaputra plains  where excess moisture and occasional water stagnation are likely Jalpallavi (a  CIMAP variety) is better choice. Its oil content is low about 0.5 –0.6% but its  herb yield is much higher.<br />
  <strong>Time of planting</strong><br />
                  The ideal planting time is the beginning of monsoon  (May-June). Late planting after July may result heavy casualty. Under irrigated  condition March-April is also suitable when there will be low weed growth.<br />
  <strong>Planting</strong><br />
                  The slips are planted at 45 x 45 cm in plain land at 5-8  cm depth on one side of the ridges half way up the slope in plains or 60 x 45  cm in sloppy land. One slip is inserted in each pit, latter filled with loose  soil and firmly pressed keeping the slip vertical. The soil moisture is  maintained till the crop establishes. Casualty should be replaced within the  next month. 40,000 slips are required to plant one-hectare area.<br />
  <strong>Closure spacing at  planting</strong><br />
                  Planting may be done at closure spacing at 45 x 22.5 cm  and after first harvest every alternate plant from the row is uprooted and used  as planting material. This gives good harvest in the first cutting and helps in  keeping down the weed problems due to higher plant population. The grass can be  intercropped with arecanut and also coconut in the initial 3-4 years of growth  as these crops attain bearing stage after about 6-7 years.<br />
  <strong>Growth</strong><br />
                  If properly planted about 90% survival is obtained.  Plants get established within 15-20 days and after 30-40 days complete green  colour appears in the field. During this time a light irrigation should be  applied in absence of rainfall.<br />
  <strong>Interculture</strong><br />
                  As the crop is planted during monsoon it faces serious  weed competition in the initial stages and upto 60 days is found to be critical  period. Generally two weedings one at 20-25 and another at 40-45 days after  planting should be done. Interculture after each harvest is necessary. In order  to get satisfactory results, an integrated method that consists of hand  weeding, application of Weedicides and mulch should be used.<br />
  <strong>Mulching</strong><br />
                  The spent material (grass after distillation) should be  applied as mulch in between the two rows @ 3 tons/ha.<br />
  <strong>Fertilizer application</strong><br />
                  For poor and medium fertility soil N, P205, K20 @  200:80:75 kg/ha/year should be applied. In the first year the organic, P and K  fertilizers are mixed into the soil at final land preparation. Nitrogen should  be applied at 4 equal splits (@ 50 kg N) in the first year- first application  at about one month after planting with weeding and rests after each harvest. In  subsequent years the basal dose may be applied along with the first dose of N.  N as urea is top dressed soon after the regenerated crop is established and  thereafter once in every two months. In the subsequent years N dose may be  increased by 50 kg for the additional split application.<br />
                  During rainy season crop may suffer iron deficiency  leading to leaf chlorosis resulting decrease in yield and oil quality. This may  be rectified by spraying 0.25% ferrous Sulphate solution at 10-15 days  intervals for 3-4 times.<br />
  <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
                  Citronella requires sufficient moisture for good growth  and yield of herb. When there is no rain, irrigation once in 10-15 days will be  required. For undulating areas sprinkler irrigation is suggested. Irrigation  increases aldehyde content in oil besides herb yield.<br />
  <strong>Plant Protection</strong><br />
  <strong>Diseases</strong><br />
                  Most important disease is leaf blight or Carbularia leaf  blight caused by <em>Carbularia eragrostidis. </em>This can be controlled by  Carbendazim (Bavistin at 1.0g/liter) followed by Benomyl of Benzimidazole group  (Benlate 50 wp) @0.2% at 10 days interval.<br />
  <strong>Insect-pests</strong><br />
                  During dry season the crop may be affected by yellowing  and crinkling disease (due to mites). The emerging leaves become wrinkled and  pale. It may fail to open and the part may die. This may be controlled by spraying  a mixture of Docofol (Kelthane) @ 2 ml/lit and Ethion (Tafethion, 50 EC) @ 1  ml/lit along with a wetting agent like Triton AE or Enditron AE @ 0.5 ml/lit.  In the subsequent years stem borer and in rainfed condition termite may infest  the crop. These can be controlled by applying Furadan @ 20 kg/ha or by spraying  0.5 % Dimethoate 400 to 500 kg Neem oil cake. The crop sometimes may show  yellowing of growing leaves indicating a mixed deficiency of Zinc, Molybdenum  and Sulphur. Two or three foliar sprays of a complete micro-nutrient mixture at  fortnightly intervals are sufficient to combat the deficiency.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting</strong><br />
                  It is advisable to harvest (a partial harvest) after 3  months to induce tillering. In the first year only 3 cuts besides the partial  harvest can be taken, viz., 5 months after planting and 3 months after the  previous harvest. From second year onwards, 5-6 harvests can be taken per year  at 2 months intervals. Harvesting is done by sickle and cut at 15 cm above the  ground. Cutting close to the ground results into mortality of the plant.  Harvesting preferably is done before 12 O’clock.<br />
  <strong>Crop cycle:</strong><br />
                  The crop can be maintained economically for about 4  years. Then it is to be pulled out and plant with rotational crop. After  termination of the crop green manuring can be done. <br />
  <strong>Withering of the fresh  herb</strong><br />
                  After cutting, the herb is allowed to wilt for 12-24  hours to remove the excess moisture. This wilting allows better packing in the  vessel and saving of steam and fuel. Wilting more than 24 hours results loss of  essential oil. Cutting the grass into shorter length also gives 10-15 % higher  recovery. The harvested grass contains dead leaves, sheaths that should be  removed before packing into the vessel.<br />
  <strong>Distillation of oil</strong><br />
                  The grass is steam distilled for better recovery. The  distillation equipment consists of a boiler, a distillation vessel, a condenser  and two receivers / separators. The economic capacity of the unit is 1.0  ton/batch. In hilly areas small size (6-8 q) direct-fired field units are preferred.  Preferably the unit should be of stainless still for durability and oil  quality. Growers cultivating smaller areas can use properly designed  direct-fired field distillation units. Distillation is completed within 3 hours  under normal pressure starting from the initial condensation of the oil.  Prolong distillation deteriorates oil quality.<br />
                  The  trend of oil recovery is as under-<br />
                  Distillation  time % of the total oil recovery<br />
                  First  hour - 80 %<br />
                  Second  hour - 19 %<br />
                  Third  hour - 1 %<br />
                  Larger percentage of the major components about 80% in  the total oil, such as citronellal, geraniol, citronellol and geranyl acetate  is recovered in the first hour of distillation.<br />
  <strong>Yield</strong><br />
                  The partially wilted herb yield is in the range of 20-30  t/ha. The average oil recovery is 1 %. Hence the oil yield is about 200-300  kg/ha/year. A crop under average management should not yield less than 200 kg  oil/ha/year.<br />
