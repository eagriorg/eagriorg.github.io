<img src="lec13_clip_image002.jpg" alt="" width="255" height="281" hspace="12" align="left" />            Davana (<em>Artemisia pallens</em> Well.) (2n=16),  belonging to the family Asteraceae, is an important annual aromatic herb, much  prized in India for its delicate fragrance.   The Davana springs are commonly used in garlands, bouquets and religious  offerlings in most part of the country.   The leaves and flowers contain the essential oil valued for its  exquisite and delicate aroma and is used in high=-grade perfumes and cosmetics.  The oil of Davana contains hydrocarbons (20%), esters (65%) and oxygenated  compounds (15%). The esters are the major constituents responsible for the  characteristic smell of Davana.   Saponification of the oil gives 10% cinnamic acid, while the alcohol part  gives viscous oil with a high boiling point.   It is reported that a new sesquiterpene ketone called cis-davanone in  the oil is responsible for its characteristic odour.  The other constituents isolated from the oil  include a sesquiterpene ketone named &lsquo;artemone&rsquo;, novel sesquiterpenoids named.&rsquo;davanafurans&rsquo;  and another ketone named &lsquo;isodavanone&rsquo;.<br />
            The essential oil  of Davana which is a brown, viscous liquid with a rich, fruity odour has  acquired a considerable reputation in the international trade, particularly in  USA and Japan where it is being used for flavouring cakes, pastries, tobacco  and beverages</p>
				<p><strong>Originand Distribution</strong></p>
				<p>The plant grows  wild in the temperate Himalayas. It is common in the Kashmir Valley, the Simla  and Nanital Hills.  It is being  commercially cultivated in Karnataka, Maharastra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra  Pradesh in an area of about 1000 ha.  </p>
                <p><strong>Description of the Plant</strong><br />
                  Davana is an  aromatic, erect herb, about 60 cm tall, with much divided leaves and small  yellow flowers. The stem and leaves are covered with grayish-white  tomentum.  The leaves are alternate,  petiolate and lobed.  The inflorescence  is capitulate with flowers which are peduncle to sessile, axillary or forming  lax racemes, simple, heterogamous having bisexual disc florets in the centre  and a few pistillate ray florets on the periphery.<br />
                  The outer florets  are glabrous except for a few cottony hairs, tubular, generally 3-lobed.  The stigma is generally 2-lobed and rarely  3-lobed.  The inner florets are glabrous  except for a few cottony hairs, tubular, 5-lobed and bisexual: the stamens are  5 in number with free, epipetalous filaments and a dithecous inflorescence: it  has syngenecious anthers which are connective, prolonged, tapering style and  bifid.<br />
  <strong>Soil</strong><br />
                  The crop is found  growing on various types of soils from sandy loam to medium black. However, a  fertile, well-drained, sandy loam soil which is rich in organic matter is  ideal.<br />
  <strong>Climate</strong><br />
                  Season is an  important aspect to be considered when Davana is grown for extracting essential  oil.  The oil content in the plants was  observed to be maximum, when the crop was grown during the winter season  compared to the other seasons. Thus, when the crop is grown for the production  of oil, it should be planted during the first week of November.  A few light showers with moderate winter  conditions and no frost is conducive to the good growth of the plant.  High temperature and heavy rains at the time  of flowering have not only been found to affect the plant growth adversely, but  also reduces the oil content and ultimately the oil yield.<br />
  <strong>Cultivation</strong><br />
  <strong>Nursery raising</strong><br />
                  Davana is  propagated by seeds.  As the seeds lose  viability rapidly, only the seeds from the previous season&rsquo;s crop should only  be used for sowing.  About 1.5 kg of seed  is required to produce enough seedlings to transplant into an area of one  hectare.<br />
                  Usually,  nursery-beds 2 m long and 1 m wide are preferred.  The surface of the beds should be clod-free.  It is then incorporated with finely prepared FYM at the rate of 10 kg per bed.  Sowing of seeds at the rate of 1 g/sq m is desirable.  The seeds may be sown either dry or after  wetting them along with sand for about 48 hours.  In the latter case, the seeds are thoroughly  mixed with sand @ 4-5 times their volume.   To this mixture, water is added so that the sand is sufficiently  wet.  It is then tied in a cloth bag and  stored in a warm place for 48 hours.   This will hasten the sprouting of seeds and the radicle will emerge at  the end of 48 hours. The nursery-bed is then flooded with water to make a pool  and the sprouting seed and sand mixture is broadcasted all over the bed,  homogeneously.  This method helps in  uniform distribution of seeds.  When the  seeds have settled down, a thin layer of sand is spread over just enough to  cover them.  The seeds will germinate  within 2-3 days of sowing. Hand watering is done till the seedlings establish  themselves (7-10days), after which the beds are irrigated directly though the  water channels. <br />
                  While sowing the  dry seeds, they are mixed with sand in the ratio of 1:10 and broadcasted homogenously  all over the bed.  A thin layer of sand  is then spread uniformly to cover the seeds and the beds are hand watered twice  a day. To prevent the ants from carrying away the sees, an application of 10  kg/ha of Heptachlor to the soil about 10 days prior to sowing has been  helpful.  Using this method, the  germination of seeds is observed in about 4-5 days.<br />
                In areas where  there are rains at the time of nursery raising, the seedlings may be grown on  raised nursery-beds which will also help in reducing the incidence of  damping-off disease. As there is a very slow growth of seedlings initially,  foliar sprays of urea (0.1%) at weekly intervals, 3 weeks after sowing, may be  given to boost their growth.</p>
                <p><strong>Transplanting     </strong><br />
                  The seedlings  will be ready for transplanting in about 6-8 weeks from the date of sowing. At  this stage, the seedlings should be about 10 cm tall. Before transplanting, the  field is thoroughly prepared by bringing the land to a fine tilth with repeated  ploughings.  It is then laid out into plots  of convenient size by laying out bunds and channels. The size of the plot  depends on the conditions prevailing locally.   However, generally, plots of 3-4 m x 1.5-2.5 m size are preferred as it  facilitates irrigation, weeding and other intercultural operations. <br />
                  After the preparation of the plots, the soil  is incorporated with 6 t/ha of well decomposed FYM or compost. The plots are  irrigated a day prior to transplanting.   The seedlings are then transplanted at a spacing of 15 cm between rows  and 7.5 cm between plants. Trails have shown that transplanting Davana plants  closed together results in higher herbage-yield and, subsequently, higher  oil-yield compared to wider spacing, which results in larger plants but lower  herbage and oil-yield per unit area.  <br />
  <strong>Manures and Fertilizers </strong><br />
                  Davana responds  well to the application of manures and fertilizers.  Well-decomposed FYM at the rate of 6 t/ha is  incorporated into the soil at the time of land preparation.  Subsequently, a fertilizer dose of 40 kg P  and 40 kg K/ha is given at the time of transplanting. While N is applied at the  rate of 120 kg/ha in three equal split doses: the first dose is given at 10  days after transplanting and the subsequent two doses at  15 days&rsquo; intervals thereafter.   <br />
  <strong>Irrigation   </strong> <br />
                  After  transplanting, the plots are immediately provided with light irrigation. Later,  irrigation is provided daily till the seedlings are well established (10-12  days) and, subsequently, once in 3-4 days depending on the weather conditions.<br />
  <strong>Interculture</strong><br />
                  The field is kept  weed-free by regular weeding as and when required.  In all, about 2-3 hand-weedings during the  early period of growth will help to keep the weeds down.<br />
  <strong>Growth Regulator  Application </strong><br />
                  Growth regulators  have been used to boost the growth and yield in many crops.  In Davana also, an application of GA at 200  ppm after five weeks of transplanting has been found to increase the herb and  essential oil-yield per unit area.<br />
  <strong>Insect Pests</strong><br />
                  No serious attack  of insect pests has been reported in Davana. However, some insect pests like  leaf-eating caterpillars, aphids and termites have been observed to after the  crop. <br />
                  The application  of Aldrex to the plots will control the attack of termites, while the spraying  of any systemic insecticide like 0.05% of Monocrotophos or 0.2% of Dimethoate  will control the incidence of aphids and the spraying of contact insecticides  like 0.2% Metacid will control leaf-eating caterpillars.<br />
  <strong>DISEASES - Damping-off</strong><br />
                  This disease is  caused by fungus belonging to the <em>Rhizoctinia </em>spp. It is usually severe at the nursery stage, particularly when there is  high humidity and cloudy weather conditions, resulting in the heavy mortality  of seedlings. Controlling the irrigation will reduce the incidence of the  disease.  Treating the seeds with Emisan  @ 0.2% or Ridona MZ at 0.1% before sowing and then drenching the seed-beds with  the above chemicals a week after germination controls the disease. <br />
  <strong>Harvesting  </strong><br />
                  The crop starts  flowering after 110-115 days of sowing, which will be around the 2nd  or 3 rd week of February.  In order to  obtain the maximum essential oil-yield, the plants should be harvested when  about 50% of them have come to the flowering stage.  This is usually at the end of February or in  the 1st week of March, about 120-125 days after sowing.  Harvesting is done by cutting the plants from  the base.  Although there are reports  about the possibility of obtaining a ratoon crop in Davana,   it is not practical as the main crop is  harvested only during the month of March and the ratoon starts sprouting by the  end of March or the beginning of April which, due to the high temperatures  prevailing during these period, results in poor growth of the plants and  mutilated flower-buds which may even fail to open.  The crops, thus obtained, become uneconomical  as the flower-heads are the major contributors of oil.<br />
  <strong>Distillation</strong><br />
                  The harvested  material, before distillation, is dried under the shade for 2 days.  It is better to distill this immediately  rather than to store it. The dried material is steam-distilled to obtain good  quality oil.  However, for the estimation  of essential oil under laboratory conditions, particularly of a small sample,  the shade-dried material is hydro-distilled.<br />
                  In the case of  hydro-distillation, the material is placed in a glass still and water is added  to it, so that around three-fourths of the material is immersed in water and it  is then heated.  During boiling, the  water vapours along with the vaporized oil moves into the condenser, gets  condensed and collects in a graduated receive.   Based on the amount of oil collected, the oil content of the material  can be determined.<br />
                  However, for  commercial purposes, steam distillation should be used. The distillation  equipment consists of : (i) A Boiler, which produces the stem; (ii) A  Distillation Still in which the material is filled and steam is passed through;  (iii)A Condenser, wherein the vaporized oil gets condensed into a liquid form  and (iv) A Receiver, to collect the oil.<br />
                  The boiler and  the distillation still are made of steel.   The boiler is connected to the distillation still by a steel pipe  through which the steam passes. A perforated grid (plate) is placed at the  bottom of the still on which the plant material is kept.  The distillation still is connected to the condenser  through a pipe.  The condenser consists  of many metallic pipes mounted inside a jacket.   It is provided with an inlet and an outlet. Water is passed through the  gap between the pipes in order to cool the steam and essential oil vapours into  liquid form, which then gets collected in the steel receiver.  The oil, being lighter than water and  insoluble, floats on the surface of the water.<br />
                  For distillation,  the air-dried herbage is chopped into smaller pieces and then charged into the  still. While filling, the material should be tightly packed inside the still,  as otherwise steam channels may be formed during distillation resulting in poor  yields.  About 5-6 hours are required to  complete the charge.<br />
                  After decantation  of the top, clear layer of oil, the bottom layer which consists of small  quantities of water and oil has to be clarifies. To separate the oil, a  saturated solution of sodium chloride is added to this mixture so that a  separated layer of water and oil is formed. The lower water-layer is drained  off with the help of a separating funnel and the upper layer of oil is  collected.<br />
  <strong>Yield and Oil Content</strong><br />
                  The yield of  fresh herbage, including flower-heads, is around 12-13 t/ha. Though, under  laboratory conditions, the oil content in the whole plant after during it in  the shade for 2 days is 0.29%. An average recovery of around 0.2% under  large-scale distillation, yielding 12-13 kg/ha of oil may be considered  satisfactory.<br />
                  When oil is  extracted from the whole plant, the flower-heads contribute the major portion  of the oil. The contribution of the leaves and stems towards the percentage of  oil content in a whole plant is very little.   The percentage of oil content in different plant parts, worked out under  laboratory conditions on V/W basis, is as follows:</p>
