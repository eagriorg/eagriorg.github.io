				<p align="center"><strong>OPIUM</strong><br />
				  (<em>Papaver somniferum </em>L., Papaveraceae)</p>
                <p>   The  opium poppy <em>Papaver somniferum </em>is an outstanding medicinal plant, the  products of which viz opium and codeine are important medicines used for their  analgesic and hypnotic effects. A semi-synthetic derivative of this drug from  morphine known as heroin has led to world-wide social problems. But attempts to  find a synthetic drug which would replace morphine and codeine have not been  fruitful so far. Its cultivation in India is confined to states of Madhya Pradesh,  Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.<br />
                <em>            Papaver  somniferum </em>is an erect, rarely  branched, glaucous annual, growing to a height of 60 to 120 cm. The leaves are  ovate, oblong or linear oblong; flowers are large usually bluish with a  purplish base or white, purple or variegated. It produces capsular type of  fruits from which the latex known as opium is obtained on lancing. The fruits  are about 2.5 cm in diameter, globose in shape. Seeds are reniform with white  or black in colour. Though nearly all parts of the poppy plant contain a white  milky latex, the unripe capsules contain large amount.</p>

                <p><br />
                  <strong>Climate and Soil </strong><br />
                  It is a  crop of temperate climate but can be grown successfully during winter in  sub-tropical regions. Cool climate favours higher yield, while higher day/night  temperature generally affects the yield. Frosty or desiccating temperature,  cloudy or rainy weather tends to reduce not only the quantity but also the  quality of opium. <br />
                  Opium  poppy prefers a well drained, highly fertile light black or loam soil with an  optimum pH around 7.0. <br />
                  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
                  The  most popular varieties grown in the country remain in the field from 140 to 160  days. The following are some of the important varieties of which Talia,  Ranghatak and Dhola Chota Gothia are popular varieties recommended for heavy  black soils.                </p>
                <p><strong>(i) Talia</strong><br />
                  It  is sown early and it remains in the field for 140 days. Its flowers are pink  and have large petals. The capsule is oblong, ovate, light-green and shiny  (waxy).<br />
  <strong>(ii) Ranghatak</strong><br />
                  It  is a medium-tall variety, maturing for lancing in 125-130 days after sowing. It  bears white and light-pink flowers. It produces medium-sized capsules (7.6 cm x  5.0 cm), which are slightly flat­tened on the top. It yields opium of a  comparatively thin consistency that change to a dark-brown colour on exposure.<br />
  <strong>(iii) Dhola Chota Gotia</strong><br />
                  It  is a dwarf cultivar (85-90 em), bearing pure white flowers and light­ green  capsules which are oblong-ovate in shape. It is ready for lancing after 105-115  days of sowing and matures for seed in 140 days.<br />
  <strong>(iv) MOP-3</strong><br />
                  This  variety has been developed <em>at </em>the Jawaharlal Nehru Krishi Vishwa  Vidyalaya, Mandsaur, recently. It bears pinkish-white flowers comprising of  large non-serrated petals. Its capsules are ready for lancing 120 days after  sowing and the variety is recommended where adequate irrigation facilities  exist in the later part of the season.<br />
  <strong>(v) MOP-16</strong><br />
                  This  is another promising selection made <em>at </em>the Jawaharalal Nehru Krishi  Vishwa Vidyalay, Mandsaur. The plant bears <em>white </em>flowers with serrated  petals and round, flat-topped capsules. This is comparatively drought tolerant  and is ready for lancing 105-110 days after sowing. It is recommended where an  early maturing crop is preferred.<br />
  <strong>(vi) Shama</strong><br />
                  This  variety was released by <em>the </em>CIMAp, Lucknow during the year 1983. The  main alkaloids like Morphine (14.51-16.75%), Codeine (2.05-3/24%), Thebaine  (1.84-2.16%), Papaverine (0.82%) and Narcotine (5.89-6.32%) in this variety  areJeDorted to be on higher side than the existing commercially cultivated  variety. It yields 39.5 kg of <em>latex </em>and 8.8 kg/ha of seeds.<br />
  <strong>(vii) Shweta</strong><br />
                  This  variety was also released by the CIMAp, Lucknow, along with Shama. However, it  is reported to be superior to Shama in the content of the main  alkaloids-morphine (15.75-22.38%), codeine (2.15-2.76%), thebaine (2.04-2.5%),  papaverine (0.94-1.1%) and Narcotine (5.94-6.5%). It gives an average yield of  42.5 kg of latex and 7.8 kg/ha of seeds.<br />
  <strong>(viii) BROP 1 (Botanical Research Opium Poppy-l)  (NBRI-3)</strong><br />
                  It  is a <em>synthetic </em>variety developed at the National Botanical Research  Institute, Lucknow, by crossing selections from Kali Dandi, Suyapankhi and  Safaid Dandi. This variety is highly adaptable to varied agroc1imatic  conditions and gives a higher yield than national checks. It is moderately  resistant to diseases. It yields about 54 kg/ha of opium and 10-13 q/ha of  seeds. The morphine content is 13% and above pose a problem, since they remain  wet during the rains and are too difficult to cultivate in the dry period.<br />
  <strong> (ix) </strong><strong>Kirtiman  (NOP-4)</strong><br />
                  It  was developed at the Narendra Dev University of Agriculture and Technology,  Kumarganj, Faizabad, through selection from local races. The variety is  moderately resistant to downy mildew. It yields 35-45 kg/ha of latex and 9-10  q/ha of seeds. The morphine content is up to 12%. .<br />
  <strong>(x) Chetak (U.O.285)</strong><br />
                  This  variety was developed at the Rajasthan Agriculture University, Udaipur. It is  moderately resistant to diseases. The opium yield is up to 54 kg/ha and the  seed-yield is 10-12 q/ha and contains up to 12% morphine.<br />
                  In  general, the crop needs long cold season (20°C) with adequate sunshine in the  early season for a healthy vegetative growth; heavy rains after sowing cause  loss in seed germination. Warm, dry weather with a temperature of 30-35°C is  required during the reproductive period. Cloudy weather, frost, hailstorms and  high gusty winds, particularly during lancing, causes immense damage to the  growing crop. Dry, warm weather conditions in February-March favour a good flow  of latex and results in higher yields.<br />
  <strong>(xii)  Jawahar Aphim 16 (JA-16)</strong><br />
                  It  is a pureline selection of 10CaIIandraces developed at the Jawaha­ralal Nehru  Krishi VlShwa Vidyalay College of Agriculture, Mandsaur (Madhya Pradesh). It is  moderately resistant to downy mildew. It gives 45-54 kg/ha of latex, 8-10 q/ha  of seeds and contains up to 12% morphine.<br />
                  Recently,  another three varieties:'NBRI-3' of opium, 'Sujatha' an opium-free poppy for  the production of oil and seed and 'Shubhra' for high morphine and seed yield  have been released from the NBRI, Lucknow, RRL, Jammu and ClMAP, Lucknow. <br />
  <strong>Preparation of land </strong><br />
                  The  field should be ploughed 3 or 4 times to produce well pulverised soil. The  field is then prepared into beds of convenient size. <br />
  <strong>Sowing</strong> <br />
                  The seed  is either sown broadcast or in lines. Before sowing, the seeds may be treated  with fungicides like Dithane M.45 @ 4 g per Kg of seeds. Seed is usually mixed <img src="lec23_clip_image004.jpg" alt="" width="182" height="185" hspace="12" align="left" />with fine sand before broadcasting to ensure uniform  spread in the bed. Line sowing is preferred to broadcasting as the latter  method has many drawbacks like higher seed rate, poor crop stand and difficulty  in carrying out inter cultural operations. The best time for sowing is late  October or early November. Seed rate is 7-8 Kg/ha for broadcast method and 4-5  Kg/ha for line sowing. A spacing of 30 cm between lines and 30 cm between  plants is normally adopted. <br />
  <strong>After cultivation </strong><br />
                  Germination  takes five to ten days depending upon the moisture content of the soil.  Thinning is an important cultural practice to ensure uniform plant growth and  better development. This is normally done When the plants are 5-6 cm high,  having 3-4 leaves. Thinning is continued until the plants are about 14 to 15 cm  height within a period of 3-4 weeks after sowing. <br />
  <strong>Manures and manuring</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong> Opium poppy  responds remarkably to the application of manures and fertilizers which  increase both the yield and quality of opium. <br />
                  Farm yard manure @ 20-30 t/ha is  generally applied by broadcasting while the field is prepared for sowing.  Besides, 60- 80 Kg of N and 40-50 Kg of P2O5 per hectare  is recommended. No potash is applied. Half of N and entire P are applied at  sowing time through placement and remaining· half bf N placed at rosette stage. <br />
  <strong>Irrigation</strong> <br />
              A careful irrigation management  schedule is essential to get a good crop of poppy. A light irrigation is given  immediately after sowing followed by another light irrigation after 7 days when  the seeds start germinating. Three irrigations at an interval of 12-15 days are  given till pre flowering stage and then irrigation frequency is reduced at 8-10  days during flowering and capsule formation stage. Normally, 12-15 irrigations  are given during the entire crop period. Any moisture stress during the stage  of fruiting and latex extracting may reduce the yield considerably. <br />

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Lancing  and latex collection</strong> <br />
                  Opium starts flowering in 95-115  days after sowing. The petals start shedding after 3-4 days of flowering. The  capsules mature after 15-20 days of flowering. Lancing of the capsules exudes  maximum latex at this stage. This stage can be visually judged by the  compactness and a change in the colour from greenish to light green coloured  ring in the capsule. The stage is called as industrial maturity. <br />
                  Lancing may be done with a knife  having three or four equispaced pointed ends which does not penetrate more than  1-2 mm in the capsule. Too deep or too shallow incision is not advisable.  Lancing may be done early in the morning before 8.00 a.m. at two days interval  in each capsule. The length of the incision should be 1/3 or less than the full  length of capsule. <br />
  <img src="lec23_clip_image008.jpg" alt="" width="287" height="215" hspace="12" align="left" /></p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Harvesting  and threshing </strong><br />
                  The crop is left for drying for  about 20-25 days when the last lancing on the capsules stops exudation of  latex. The capsules are then picked up and the plant is removed with sickles.  Harvested capsules are dried in open yard and seeds are collected by beating  with a wooden rod. <br />
                  The yield of raw opium varies from  50 to 60 kg/ha. </p>
