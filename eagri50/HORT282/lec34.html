				  Stevia is a subtropical perennial that  produces sweet steviol glycosides in the leaves for which it also known as  &lsquo;Cheeni Tulsi&rsquo; or &lsquo;Mou Tulsi&rsquo;. Plants grown at higher latitudes actually have a  higher percentage of sweet glycosides. The plant can be utilized as a source  for the production of natural sweetener (food), as a source of chlorophyll,  phytosterols (non-food: medicine). The sweetener can be converted into  gibberellins by fermentation (Non-food — Agrochemicals), the vegetative residue  can be used as animal feed and the stalks can be used as a source of cellulose  (Non-food: Cellulose industry). <br />
				  Its medicinal uses include regulating blood sugar,  preventing hypertension, treatment of skin disorders, and prevention of tooth  decay. The compound obtained from stevia is considered to be the best alternate  source for diabetes sufferer. The added value for this new crop can go up to a  considerable extent.<br />
  <strong>Market potential</strong><br />
				  Market opportunity appears great. Statistics indicate  that in some countries up to 30 % of their needed sugar is replaced by  stevioside-like sweetness products.<br />
  <strong>Soil</strong><br />
				  Stevia prefers a well-drained fertile sandy loam or loam  soil, high in organic matter with ample supply of water. It prefers acidic to  neutral (pH 6-7) soil for better growth. It requires a consistent supply of  moisture, but not waterlogged. Too much soil moisture can cause rot.<br />
  <strong>Climate</strong><br />
				  It is a semi-humid subtropical plant that shows higher  leaf production under high light intensity and warm temperature. Day length is  more critical than light intensity. Long spring and summer days favour leaf  growth. Short days trigger blossoming. Stevia prefers partial shade during  considerable summer sunshine.<br />
  <strong>Variety</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>There are 3 named varieties developed by Sun Fruits Pvt Ltd, Pune <em>viz,</em> <br />
  <strong>1) S.R.B-123:</strong> It can be harvested 5 times in year. The glycoside content is in  between 9-12% found suitable for South.<br />
  <strong>2) S.R.B-512:</strong> It is suitable for Northern India and the Glycoside content is in  between 9-12%.<br />
  <strong>3) S.R.B-128:</strong> Highest stevioside content up to 21%. Found suitable for Northern  India.<br />
				  4) Material that yields  Stevioside in the range of 9 – 12% or above can be used as good material for  commercial cultivation and should be maintained by vegetative propagation only.<br />
  <strong>Propagation</strong><br />
				  Stevia is usually propagated by stem cuttings, which root  easily. Sweetness in leaves varies with varieties. Therefore, for propagation  cutting should be obtained from a source, which is high in stevioside and low  in associated bitterness. Rooting can be enhanced by using commercial rooting  hormones. Cutting should be 2-4 inches long, from leaf axils of current year  growth with atleast two leaf buds above ground. All the lower leaves are  removed keeping 2or 3 small leaves. Treatment with Paclobutrazol @ 100 ppm has  been found to induce the root initiation in short time. Effective outcome of  this treatment can be obtained when the cuttings are planted during the month  of February-March. Propagation can be done in other period also with varying  success.<br />
  <strong>Land Preparation</strong><br />
				  Land is either disced and <em>/</em>or harrowed twice to  prepare a fairly smooth, firm-planting surface. Around 50 MT of FYM / ha has to  be applied as a basal dressing during the last ploughing to incorporate the  manure with the soil. With proper drainage and irrigation channels the field is  divided into plots of convenient size.  <br />
  <strong>Raised bed preparation</strong><br />
				  Forming raised beds is the most economical way to grow  Stevia. The raised bed should be of 15 cm in height and 60 cm in width. The  distance between two rows should be 40 cm and that between each plant 23 cm.  This would give a plant population of around 75,000 per hectare.<br />
  <strong>Planting</strong><br />
				  March to mid May gives better results. Immediate after  planting one irrigation is necessary. The concentration of stevioside in the  leaves increases when the plants are grown under long day condition where  vegetative period is longer and steviol glycoside yields will be higher.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
                  It needs irrigation, as Stevia cannot stand drought<strong>. </strong>Sprinkler  irrigation (micro sprinklers) is found to be advantageous since the herb is  highly sensitive to water stress and requires frequent light irrigation. During  summer irrigation at 3-5 days interval gives best results.<br />
  <strong>Mulching</strong><br />
                  In order to reduce the impact of drought and high  temperature, addition of mulches around the plant is recommended.<br />
  <strong>Nutrient uptake</strong><br />
                  Study revealed that at the point of maximum dry matter  accumulation, stevia plants consist of 1.4 % N, 0.3% P and 2.4 % K. When  biomass production is 7500 kg/ha, it is constituted by 26 % roots, 35 % stems  and 39 % leaves. Such biomass would require about 105 kg N, 23 kg P and 180 kg  K from both soil and fertilizer. Therefore, the actual rate of application will  vary according to soil type and production environment, and need to be  optimized for each specific situation.<br />
  <strong>Manuring and fertilization</strong><br />
                  Under average condition application of FYM @ 50 t/ha and  fertilizers N-60 kg, P2O5 30 kg and K2O 45 kg/ha is recommended. N is applied  in three splits once at basal and remaining two applications after first and  second cutting. Stevia plants prefer low nitrogen, but high level of phosphorus  and potassium. Slow release nitrogen sources are better due to requirement of  low level of N and steady release of N from source. Sometimes stevia shows the  symptoms of boron deficiency, which leads to leaf spot and that can be  rectified by spraying Borax 6 %. Since the feeder roots tend to be quite near  the surface, addition of compost for extra nutrients is beneficial.<br />
  <strong>Plant protection</strong><br />
                  No serious pest and diseases have been observed. Neem oil  diluted in water may be sprayed against aphids if appear. Deer and rabbits are  fond of Stevia due to sweet taste. Fencing is necessary.<strong> </strong><br />
  <strong>Harvesting</strong><br />
                  Time of harvesting depends on land type, variety and  growing season. The first harvest of the crop can be had in four months after  planting and subsequent harvest once every 3 months. Generally it can be  scheduled for mid to late September when plants are 50-70 cm in height. Short  days induce flowering. Optimum yield (biomass) and stevioside quality and  quantity is best obtained just before flowering. The easiest harvesting  technique is to cut the branches off with pruning shears before stripping the  leaves. The tips of the stems can be clipped off and added to harvest yield, as  they contain as much stevioside as do the leaves. On an average three  commercial harvests can be obtained per year. It is better to cut the plants  leaving about 10 cm stem portion from the ground. This will facilitate new flushes  to emerge, which can be harvested as the next crop. For domestic use leaves may  be used fresh for tea or may be combined with mint leaves.<br />
  <strong>Drying</strong><br />
                  Immediately after harvest the herb is dried. This can be  accomplished on a screen or net. The freshly harvested plants can be hung  upside down and dried in shade. It can also be dried using simple drying racks  inside transparent poly house or transparent glass roofing or by passing dry  air just above room temperature. Drying of the stem and soft green leaf  material is completed immediately after harvesting utilizing a drying wagon or  a kiln or done naturally in case of large-scale production. Depending on  weather conditions and density of loading, it generally takes 24 to 48 hours to  dry stevia at 400 to 500 C. The drying process does not require excessive heat;  more important is good air circulation. On a moderately warm fall day, stevia  can be quick dried in the full sun in about 12 hours. (Longer drying time will  lower the stevioside content of the final product). A home dehydrator can also  be used, although sun drying is the preferred method. After adequate drying,  the leaves are stripped of the stems / twigs and packed and stored in cool, dry  place. For large-scale commercial production artificial drying and threshing of  the dry herbs to separate leaves may be employed.<br />
  <strong>Yield</strong><br />
                  About 15,000kg/ha of green herb is obtained which on  drying gives about 4166-kg/ha. After separating stems this yields about 3000  kg/ha in the first year. Yield goes on decreasing from 3rd year of planting and  hence terminated.<br />
  <strong>Packaging</strong><br />
                  Dry leaves are stored in plastic lined cardboard boxes,  sealed, strapped and labeled for further processing. After powdering it is to  be packed and leveled properly.<br />
  <strong>Replacement and replanting</strong><br />
                  From the subsequent years some plants will die off due to  various reasons, these gaps should immediately be filled up by well-developed  seedlings raised in large size poly bags. Depending on soil type and management  the productivity will decline after 2-3 years and this should be replaced with  new plantation.<br />
  <strong>Growing Stevia in home  garden</strong><br />
                  Stevia can be grown either in pots on balcony or any  sunny spot. It does well in &ldquo;container gardens&rdquo;. A 10 to 12 inches diameter  container filled with a lightweight growing mix is an ideal size for each  plant. A little mulch on the top will help retain the moisture in the shallow  root zone.</p>
