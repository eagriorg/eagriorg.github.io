<h2 align="center">COLEUS</h2>
                <p align="center"><em>Coleus forskohlii </em>Syn: <em>Coleus  barbatus </em>Brig.,<br />
                  It belongs to the family Lamiaceae,  is one of the most significant potential medicinal crops of the future as its  pharmaceutical properties have been discovered only recently. The tuberous  roots are found to be rich source of forskolin (syn.Coleonol) which is being  developed as a drug for hypertension, glaucoma, asthma, congestive heart  failures and certain types of cancers. The plant is well known throughout the  country. In Egypt and Africa the leaves of <em>C.barbatus</em> are used as an  expectorant, emmenagogue and diuretic while its foliage is employed in treating  intestinal disorders, and it has been used as a condiment in India for a long  time. The tuberous roots of this plant resembling a carrot in shape and brown  in color are the commercial parts.</p>
                <h1>Orgin  and Distribution</h1>
                <p>            The crop has been distributed all  over the tropical and subtropical regions of India, Pakisthan, Srilanka, Brazil  and Ethiopia. In India, it is found to be in the subtropical Himalayan regions  from Kumaon to Nepal, Bihar and the Decan Plateau of Southern India. It is  cultivated in parts of Rajashan, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamilnadu in an  area of about 2500ha.</p>
                <h1>Description  of the plant</h1>
                <p><img src="http://eagri.org/eagri50/HORT282/lec10_clip_image002_0002.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="230" hspace="12" align="left" /><strong></strong><em>Coleus  barbatus</em> (2n – 30) is an  aromatic perennial plant 0.5 m tall with thick tubers and with very showy  bluish to pale lavender coloured flowers, arranged in whorls on a long spike  like recemes. The entire plant is aromatic (whether fresh or dried).The leaves  and tubers have quite different odours, the latter being reminiscent of but  quite different from, ginger.<br />
                  Members of the genus Coleus, have  square stems, branched, the nodes are often hairy. The leaves are usually  pubescent, narrowed into petioles. The flowers borne on recemes are perfect; the  calyx is fine toothed and deflexed in the front. The pale-blue corolla is  bilabiate, the lower lobes are elongated and concave. The ovary is four parted  and the stigma is bilobed. Coleus flowers are cross-pollinated by means of wind  or insects. The species has four didynamus, with declinate stamens where  filaments unite as a sheath at the base. The roots are tuberous, fasiculated,  Up to 20 cm long and 0.5-2.5 cm thick, they are conical, fusiform, straight,  orangish and strongly aromatic.</p>
                <h1>Varieties </h1>
                <p><strong>1.  Manganiperu</strong>: It is  cultivated in and around Belgaum districts of Karnataka. The tubers are big,  30.00cm length. It is also commercially cultivated in Tamil Nadu.<br />
                  <strong>2.  Garmai</strong>: It is  cultivated in Gujarat state. The tubers are in medium size.<strong></strong><br />
                  <strong>3.  Maimul</strong></p>
                <h1>Soil</h1>
                <p>          It thrives best in porous and  well-drained soils with a pH ranging from 5.5-7.It does not require very  fertile soils and can be grown on soils with marginal fertility. The red, sandy  loam soils of Karnataka are ideal for the cultivation of the crop.</p>
                <h1>Climate</h1>
                <p>          Coleus is a crop of the tropics and  is found growing well on barren hills at an attitude of about 2400 m, under  tropical conditions. In India it is grown mainly in Belgaum and in Gujarat. The  climate here is humid with RH ranging from 83 to 95% and a temperature of 10  -25C. The annual rainfall is 100-160cm, mainly between June to September. It is  also found to perform well in less humid and warmer regions of South India like  Coimbatore, where it is grown as an irrigated crop.<br />
                  <strong>Seed  and seed rate</strong><br />
                  The crop is propagated through  terminal cuttings (10 cm) or rooted cuttings.<br />
  <strong>Season</strong><br />
                  Planting is done during June –  July.<br />
  <strong>Planting</strong> <br />
                  Planting is done at 60 x 45 cm  spacing (37,030 plants/ha). In low fertile soils, planting is done at 60 x 30  cm which requires 55, 500 plants/ha.<br />
  <img src="http://eagri.org/eagri50/HORT282/lec10_clip_image004_0000.jpg" alt="" width="314" height="236" hspace="12" align="left" /><strong> </strong><br />
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>             Before planting the field is ploughed deep  soon after the pre monsoon showers and brought to a fine tilth. <br />
                  <strong>Manures  and fertilizers</strong><br />
                  Studies conducted at TNAU,  Coimbatore, to standardize the nutritional requirement of this crop have shown  that it response well to the application of FYM 15t/ha, 30kg N, 60kg P2O5  and 50kg K2O/ha and dry (3.982t/ha) tuber yield from this  crop. Half the dose of N, the whole P and whole K may be applied as the basal  dose followed by the remaining half N, 30 days after planting as top-dressing.  Apply 10 kg ZnSo4/ha to avoid micronutrient deficiency.</p>
                <h1>Irrigation                            </h1>
                <p>          The first irrigation is given  immediately after transplanting, if there are no rains. During the first 2  weeks after planting, the crop is irrigated once in 3 days and thereafter  weekly irrigation is enough to obtain good growth and yield.</p>
                <h1>Weeding</h1>
                <p>          Due to the frequent irrigations  during the initial stages, there is a lot of competition from weeds. In order  to obtain economic yields, frequent weeding during the early growth period is  desirable.</p>
                <h1>Pest  and diseases</h1>
                <h1>Pests</h1>
                <p>          The leaf –eating caterpillars, mealy  bugs and root-knot nematodes are the important pests that attack this crop.  These insects can be controlled by spraying the plants and drenching their  roots with 0.1% methyl parathion, while nematodes can be controlled by the  application of carbofuran granules @ 20kg/ha.<br />
                  <strong>Plant  protection</strong><br />
                  Among diseases, bacterial wilt is he  major one. <br />
  <strong>Nematode</strong><br />
                  1.  Crop rotation with Sorghum and Maize can be maintained<br />
                  2. Planting of marigold along the sides of channels control nematode population<br />
                  3.  Apply 200 kg/ha of neem cake before planting<br />
                  4. Apply 15 – 20 kg/ha of Carbofuran to control the infestation<br />
  <strong>Root  rot</strong><br />
  <em>            Trichoderma viridi</em> @ 5 kg/ha is mixed with  well rottened FYM and applied twice at 20 days interval.<br />
  <strong>Bacterial  wilt</strong> <br />
                  Drench 300 ppm of  Streptocycline to control the wilt. Also apply <em>Pseudomonas fluorescence</em> 5 kg/ha by mixing it  with well rottened FYM.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting </strong><br />

The crop is ready  for harvest 4.5 to 5 months after planting. The plants are loosen, uprooted,  the tubers separated, cleaned and sun dried for the extraction of &ldquo;forskolin&rdquo;. </p>
