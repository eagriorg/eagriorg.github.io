				<p align="center"><strong>MEDICINAL SOLANUM</strong><br />
				  <em>(Solanum khasianum (Clarke), </em>Solanaceae)<br />
				  Among the various plants which are being used as raw  materials for the production of steroidal drugs, steroid-bearing solanum holds  an important place due to its quick growth and low initial investment in its  commercial cultivation. It yields a glyco-alkaloid, solasodine, a nitrogen  analogue of diosgenine. Solasodine through 16-dehydro-pregnenolone (16 DPA) is  converted to a group of compounds like testosterone and methyl­ testosterone  and corticosteroids like predinisolone and hydrocortisone. These steroidal  compounds have anti-inflammatory, anabolic and antifertility properties, due to  which they find large-scale use in health and family planning programmes all  over the world.<br />
  <strong>Distribution</strong><br />
				  It  is widely distributed in the subcontinent, extending from sea-level up to 2 000  m and is reported from Khasi, Jaintia and the Naga Hills of Assam and Manipur.  It occurs in Sikkim, West Bengal, Orissa, the Upper Gangetic Plains and in the  Nilgiris, ascending to an altitude of 1 600 m. It is reported from North-east,  North-west, southern as well as Central India, and extends into Burma and  China. Its com­mercial cultivation is mainly confined to the Akola-Jalgoan  tract of Maharashtra in an area of about 3 000 ha.<br />
  <strong>Description of the Plant</strong><br />
  <em>Solanum khasianum synonym(s): </em><em>Solanum </em>viarum  Dunal (2n = 24), belonging to the family <em>Solanaceae, </em>is a stout,  branched, woody shrub attaining a height of 0.75 to 1.5 m. The stem has spines,  the leaves are ovate to lobed with spines on both the' surfaces, the flowers  are hermophrodite, borne on axillary clusters, white; the berries are yellowish  when ripe or greenish; the seeds are small, brown in colour and abundant,  embedded in a sticky mucilage.</p>
                <p><img src="lec30_clip_image002.jpg" alt="" width="284" height="201" hspace="12" align="left" /><img src="lec30_clip_image004.jpg" alt="" width="296" height="203" hspace="12" align="left" /> <br />
                  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
                  Some  of the promising, less spiny strains developed in this crop arethe Galxo  strain, BARC Strain, Pusa-1, RRL 20-2 and RRL-G, L-6 which is said to be  completely spineless. 'Arka Sanjeevini' and 'Arka Mahima' are the two diploid  and tetrapoloid varieties of this crop developed at the Indian Institute of  Horticultural Research, Hessarghatta, Bangalore and released for cultivation.<br />
  <strong>Soil</strong><br />
                  Solanum  is a hardy plant and can be cultivated on a wide range of soils under various  agro climatic conditions, but it cannot withstand water-logging. Though it can  be grown in all types of soils, the best soil for its successful cultivation is  red lateritic soil with a moderate quantity of organic matter. The plant does  not perform well in very clayey soils. It is sown in lines of 1 to 1.5 cm-deep  furrows, 10 cm apart and covered with a thin layer of soil. About 1.25 kg seeds  sown in 5 nursery beds of the above size will provide enough seedlings for  planting 1 ha of land. Their germination is completed in 7-10 days. Within 4-5  weeks, when the seedlings are 10-12 cm high and develop 6 leaves, they are  ready for transplanting into the main field.<br />
  <strong>Climate</strong><br />
                  It  is found growing under different kinds of climates throughout the length and  breadth of the country, but prefers a moderate climate for its successful  growth. The growth as well as development of the plants and finally, the yield  of fruits depends significantly on the climatic conditions. Depending upon the  temperate, dry period length, rainfall and irrigation facilities, the sowing  time may vary from June to September or October. The plants sown in late  October to February are more susceptible to virus diseases, and sowing in March  is not practicable as harvesting and drying will be hindered by the rainy  season. Under rainfed conditions, the crop should be sown from mid-June to the  first week of July. Under irrigated conditions, the sowing in September results  in profuse flowering and berry formation during the winter months.<br />
  <strong>Manures and Fertilizers</strong><br />
  <em>            Solanum  viarum </em>responds well  to the application of manures and fertilizers. Green manuring before planting  has been found to increase the yield by 20%. For better yields, an application  of 100:60: 40 kg of N, P and K /ha, depending upon the soil condition, is recom­mended.  The entire quantity of phosphorus, potassium and half of the nitrogen are  applied at the time of land preparation. While the remaining half of the  nitrogen is applied when the plants start flower­ing. A fertilizer dose of 65:  40: 40 kg of N, P and K has been recommended under Bangalore conditions.</p>

                </strong>
                <p><strong>Land Preparation and Planting</strong><br />
                  In  the absence of sufficient moisture in the soil, the field should be immediately  irrigated after transplanting. The crop is further irrigated at weekly  intervals during the first month and then the interval is increased to once in  fortnight, and later as and when required. Well before the time of  transplanting, the field is thoroughly pre­pared about 25 t/ha FYM is  incorporated into the soil, it is divided into blocks of convenient sizes, and  ridges are opened at a distance of 60 cm.<br />
                  At  the time of transplanting, the seedlings uprooted from the beds are thoroughly  cleaned of soil and dipped in 0.1 % Bavistin solution for at least 5 minutes to  overcome the wilt problem and, thereafter, transplanted at a distance of 45 cm  within the row. Spacing of 50 x 50 cm, 75 x 75 cm and 90 x 120 cm are also  recommended for this crop for different locations.<br />
  <strong>Interculture</strong><br />
                  After  2-3 weeks of transplanting the first weeding is done, and later when the crop  is 2-3 months old. Afterwards, the crop puts on enough canopy to smother the  surface and, hence, no growth of weeds takes place.<br />
  <strong>Pests and Diseases </strong><br />
  <strong>Insect Pests</strong><br />
                  The  plant is sufficiently hardy and, therefore, free from any of the serious pests.  However, it is sometimes attacked by leaf-eating cater­pillars and wingless  hoppers. In case of severe attack, the crop may be sprayed with Endosulphan (3 <em>ml/l) </em>to control them. The fruit borer <em>(Leucinodes orbonalis) </em>and  root-eating grubs are the other pests reported. Ekalux (2 <em>ml/l) </em>can be  sprayed to control the fruit borer. Chloropyriphos may used to control grubs.<br />
  <strong>Diseases</strong><br />
                  1. Powdery mildew will be noticed  during prolonged dry and warm period, Bavistin (I g/l) may be sprayed to  control this disease.<br />
                  2. Collar  rot or <em>Fusarium </em>wilt can be overcome by keeping the field clean and  planting the crop in a well drained soil. Dipping the roots of the seedlings in  a 0.1 % solution of Bavistin for 1 hour and drenching the seed-beds with 0.25%  of copper oxychloride or 0.1 % of Bavistin solution can control the disease.<br />
                  3.  Sometimes the plants are attacked by mosaic, caused by three different viruses,  which leads to stunted growth and chloratic leaves. Such plants are better  removed and destroyed.<br />
                  4.  Bacterial blight is not a serious disease on this crop. However, under severe  incidence, a treatment with the solution of 30 g of Streptocyclin and 30 g of  Copper sulphate dissolved in 500 I of water per hectare controls this disease.<br />
                  5.  Leaf-blight is caused by <em>Pythium butleri </em>and is not a serious problem in  this crop.<br />
                  Seedlings  may also be attacked by damping-off disease while growing in the nursery-beds.  To control this, the seeds are treated with Bavistin @ 3g /kg of seeds.  Drenching the seed-beds 2-3 days after sowing and again when 50% of the seeds  have germinated, with 0.1% of Bavistin or 0.25% of copper oxychloride solution,  helps to check the further spread of the disease.<br />
                  6. The  occurrence of the chlorotic stunt disease and its association with the  root-knot nematode <em>(Meloidogyne javanica), </em>and the wilting of plants due  to <em>M. incognita </em>have also been reported.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting and Processing of the  Berries</strong><br />
                  Generally,  the accumulation of glyco-alkaloid increases with the physiological age of the  fruit and attains its peak value in the fruits of 50-60 days. This state of  fruit growth coincides with the change in fruit colour from green to just  yellow with streaks of green still present, after which the glyco-alkaloid  content falls gradually with the maturity of fruits. The alkaloid is  distributed throughout the fruit. It is, however, established that about 60% of  this is present in, the seeds and the remaining 40% in the pericarp.<br />

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The  crop takes about 6 months to be ready for harvesting. Harvest­ing is one of the  labour-intensive operations in the cultivation of S. <em>viarum. </em>The spiny  nature of the plant hampers plucking the berries at the right stage of  maturity, which is very important. During the first part of the harvesting  season, when the fruit is big, on an average, one person with gloves can pluck  about 50 kg of berries, while working 8 hours a day. However, some good workers  in the peak season when most of the berries are ready for harvest can pick even  80 kg of berries per day. The figure is reduced to 40 kg towards the closing  season when the fruits become smaller in size. The picking operation spreads  over 3 months, because the fruits mature at different times. The processing of  berries for marketing requires a lot of care. Fresh fruits contain about 80%  moisture. The pharmaceutical firms need berries containing about 10% moisture.  Hence, the berries must be dried in the sun.</p>

                </strong>
                <p><strong>Yield</strong><br />
                  When  the crop is grown by adopting proper cultivation practices, it may yield nearly  10,000 kg/ha of fresh berries which, in turn, will give about 2 500 kg/ha of  dried berries.</p>
