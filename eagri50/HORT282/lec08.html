				<p align="center"><strong>LEMONGRASS</strong><br />
				  <em>(Cymbopogon flexuosus,</em> Poaceae<em>)</em><br />
				  <img src="lec08_clip_image002.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="314" hspace="12" align="left" /> Lemongrass commonly known as &ldquo;East Indian Lemongrass&rdquo; is a  perennial and multicut aromatic grass. The prefix &lsquo;lemon&rsquo; owes to its typical  lemon like odour, which is mainly due to the presence of citral, a cyclic  monoterpene.<br />
				  Lemongrass is the source of Lemongrass oil, a good source  of natural citral, which is used s a basic raw material for synthesis of  β-ionone used for synthesis of a number of useful aromatic compounds and  Vitamin- A. Lemongrass oil is thus used as a main substitute for &lsquo;Cod liver  oil&rsquo;. Citral itself is used in perfumery for various grades of soaps  detergents, cosmetics and flavour agent for soft drinks. Consumption of  Lemongrass in Ayurvedic preparation like Balm is also increasing. The present  domestic requirement is about 150 MT/year and about 70 MT is exported every  year. The total world production is estimated to 1300 MT/year.<br />
			    The crop provides maximum herb yield from second and  third year after planting and thereafter declines. The leaves yield essential  oil on steam distillation containing 70-90% citral.</p>
				<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
				<p >&nbsp;</p>
				<p ><strong>Soil &amp; Climate</strong><br />
				  It flourishes in a wide variety of soils ranging from  rich loams to poor laterite; also suitable to &lsquo;jhum fallow&rsquo;, hill slopes and  flood free degraded land, best suited to >well drain sandy loam. Water logged  conditions should be avoided as they are unsuitable for its cultivation.It requires a warm humid climate with plenty of sunshine  and rainfall ranging from 1800 to 3000 mm. High temperature and sunshine are  conducive to the development of oil in the plant.<br />
                  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
				  The following varieties  are recommended for commercial cultivation:<br />
				  (i) For irrigated  condition C.K.P-25 released by RRL, Jammu<br />
				  (ii) Krishna developed by  CIMAP both for irrigated and rainfed and also hill slopes (iii) Nima a dwarf  variety developed by CIMAP found promising. The citral content of Nima is much  higher than Krishna. Oil recovery is in between 0.8-1.0 %.<br />
				  (iv)Another suitable  variety for NE region is Jor Lab L-2 developed by RRL, Jorhat.<br />
                  <strong>Preparation of root slips</strong><br />
				  It is propagated vegetatively by obtained from well-grown  clumps. Tops of culms are cut off within 20-25 cm above ground. The culm (root  portion) is divided into slips containing 2-3 tillers. The lower sheath is  removed to expose young roots and the old roots are clipped off keeping the  slip 25-30 cm long<br />
                  <strong>Spacing</strong><br />
				  45 x 45 cm in plains or 60 x 45 cm in sloppy land with a  requirement of slips 45,000-50,000/ha.<br />
                  <strong>Planting</strong><br />
				  Planting is done in May-June. However, with irrigation  planting can be done during any month of the year except December-January. One  or two slips are planted into each hole, about 5-8 cm deep. It is better to  plant on ridges in high rainfall areas. Slips are transplanted firmly into the  ground. Plants get established well within 25-30 days after planting.<br />
                  <strong>Manures and fertilizer  application:</strong><br />
				  FYM: 10 t/ha to be applied and mixed well at the time of  final land preparation.<br />
                  <strong>Fertilizer</strong><br />
				  N, P205 &amp; K20-150: 60: 60 kg/ha/year should be  applied along with adequate quantity of organic matter. Before planting, the  field is thoroughly prepared and the full dose of phosphorus and potash is  incorporated. The nitrogen is applied in six equal split doses at two monthly  intervals. For economic use of fertilizers the soil should be analyzed first.<br />
                  <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
				  Irrigation is given immediately after planting when  planting is done in dry days. Thereafter two irrigations are given at 10 days  interval to establish the crop. During dry season after each harvest one  irrigation and subsequently application of recommended dose of fertilizers are  to be followed for optimum herb production. For undulating areas sprinkler  irrigation is advisable.<strong></strong><br />
                  <strong>Weeding and interculture</strong><br />
				  Lemongrass has the weed suppression capacity. One hand  weeding at 25-30 days followed by one hoeing at 40-60 days after planting is  enough to control weeds. After each harvest a nominal weeding and earthing up  of plants is beneficial for the next flush.<br />
                  <strong>Mulching</strong><br />
				  Distillation waste (spent grass) applied as organic mulch  @ 3 tons/ha in between the rows has been found very effective in controlling  weeds and maintaining soil moisture as well.<br />
                  <strong>Pests and Diseases</strong><br />
				  Lemongrass may be attacked by leaf blight caused by <em>Carbularia  veruciformis </em>that can be controlled by benzimidazole like Benlate 50 WP at  0.2% @ 550-750 litre/ha at 10 days interval.<br />
				  The most important pest is scale insect, which produces  yellow spot on the stem and sucks the sap of the leaves and stem. The insect  can be controlled by spraying 0.5 % Dimethoate.<br />
                  <strong>Age of harvesting</strong><br />
				  Citral is considered as quality  marker of lemongrass oil, which is influenced by age of crop<br />
				  At harvesting Citral  content of Krishna variety in Assam condition as influenced by age of cutting  is given below:</p>

                <p>            This shows that after first cutting the subsequent  harvests should be done within 2 – 3 months interval. But always crop should be  harvested before flowering for both quality and oil yield.<br />
                  <strong>Harvesting</strong><br />
                  First harvest is taken at 4 months age of the crop and  subsequent harvests are at 2 – 3 months intervals. Harvesting is done by  cutting the grass 10 cm above the ground level. During first year 3 cuttings  and subsequently 5 cuttings per year can be taken subject to weather conditions  and irrigation management. Both immature and over mature crops give low yield  and oil of poor quality. The optimum period of harvesting when grown on hilltop  or upper slopes is 75 days while at foothill and plains it is 60 days.<br />

                <p><strong>Distillation</strong><br />
                  The oil extracted from the wilted herb by steam  distillation in stainless steel unit. The factors influencing the oil  production during distillation are: (i) Storage of the plant material, (ii)  Treatment (wilting and cutting into pieces) of the material and (iii) The  method of distillation.<br />
                  The major source of loss is by oxidation and resinification  of the essential oil. So if the material is to be stored before processing, it  should be kept in a dry atmosphere with limited air circulation. The essential  oils are present in the oil glands, oil sacks and glandular hairs of the plant.  Therefore, before distillation, the day wilted plant material is cut into small  pieces enable them to expose directly as many oil glands as is possible. Once  the plant material has been reduced in size, it must be distilled immediately  to avoid oil loss. The wilted leaves are steam distilled which takes about 3  hours. Dipping the chopped lemongrass in sodium chloride solution for 24 hours  at 1-2 % concentration before distillation has been found to increase the  citral content.<br />
  <strong>Utilization of spent  material</strong><br />
                  The residue thrown out after the extraction of oil is  called spent grass. Cattle relish it when it is hot or is converted into silage  by adding a dilute solution of molasses. Besides a good source of manure and  mulching material the spent is used as fuel for distillation after drying and  also cheap packing material for fragile objects.<br />
