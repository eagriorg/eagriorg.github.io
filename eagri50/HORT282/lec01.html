                    <strong>Ginger</strong>: <em>Zingiber officinale Rosc</em> <strong>Family:</strong> <em>Zingiberaceae</em><br />
				  <img width="251" height="175" src="lec01_clip_image001.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /><p>Ginger is  a herbaceous perennial, the rhizomes of which are used as a spice. India is a  leading producer of ginger in the world and during 2006-07 the country produced  3.70 lakh tonnes of the spice from an area of 1.06 lakh hectares. Ginger is  cultivated in most of the states in India. However, states namely Kerala,  Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Sikkim, Nagaland and Orissa together  contribute 70 per cent to the country’s total production. <br />
  <strong>Botany</strong><br />
				  It is a herbaceous perennial with  underground rhizomes having serial leafy shoots of 0.5 to 0.75 m height,  sheathy, linear with 15 cm. Flowers borne on a spike, condensed, oblong and  cylindrical with numerous scar bracts, yellow with dark purplish spots,  bisexual, epigynous, stamens only one, ovary inferior, three carpellary, fruit  is an oblong capsule, seeds glabrous and fairly large.<br />
  <strong>Climate  and soil </strong> <br />
				  Ginger grows well  in warm and humid climate and is cultivated from sea level to an altitude of  1500 m above sea level. Ginger can be grown both under rain fed and irrigated  conditions. For successful cultivation of the crop, a moderate rainfall at  sowing time till the rhizomes sprout, fairly heavy and well distributed showers  during the growing period and dry weather for about a month before harvesting  are necessary. Ginger thrives best in well drained soils like sandy loam, clay  loam, red loam or lateritic loam. A friable loam rich in humus is ideal.  However, being an exhausting crop it is not desirable to grow ginger in the  same soil year after year. <br />
				  <strong>Varieties </strong><br />
				  Several cultivars of  ginger are grown in different ginger growing areas in India and they are  generally named after the localities where they are grown. Some of the  prominent indigenous cultivars are Maran, Kuruppampadi, Ernad, Wayanad,  Himachal and Nadia. Exotic cultivars such as Rio-de-Janeiro have also become  very popular among cultivators. High altitude research station, Pottangi,  Orissa has released three improved varieties Suprabha, Suruchi and Surari.<br />
  <strong>Season </strong> <br />
				  The best time for  planting ginger in the West Coast of India is during the first fortnight of May  with the receipt of pre monsoon showers. Under irrigated conditions, it can be  planted well in advance during the middle of February or early March. Burning  the surface soil and early planting with the receipt of summer showers results  in higher yield and reduces disease incidence. </p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Land Preparation </strong> <br />
				  The land is to be  ploughed 4 to 5 times or dug thoroughly with receipt of early summer showers to  bring the soil to fine tilth. Beds of about 1 m width, 15 cm height and of  convenient length are prepared with an inter-space of 50 cm in between beds. In  the case of irrigated crop, ridges are formed 40 cm apart. In areas prone to rhizome  rot disease and nematode infestations, solarization of beds for 40 days using  transparent polythene sheets is recommended. <br />
                  <strong>Planting </strong> <br />
				  Ginger is propagated  by portions of rhizomes known as seed rhizomes. Carefully preserved seed  rhizomes are cut into small pieces of 2.5-5.0 cm length weighing 20-25 g each  having one or two good buds. The seed rate varies from region to region and  with the method of cultivation adopted. <br />
                  <img width="231" height="184" src="lec01_clip_image003.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="http://toptropicals.com/pics/garden/m1/Aroma/Zingiber_Officinale170.jpg" />       In Kerala, the seed rate varies from 1500 to 1800 kg/ha. At  higher altitudes the seed rate may vary from 2000 to 2500 kg/ha. The seed  rhizomes are treated with Mancozeb 0.3% (3 g/L of water) for 30 minutes, shade  dried for 3-4 hours and planted at a spacing of 20-25 cm along the rows and  20-25 cm between the rows. The seed rhizome bits are placed in shallow pits  prepared with a hand hoe and covered with well rotten farm yard manure and a  thin layer of soil and levelled. <br />
                  <strong>Manuring </strong> <br />
				  At the time of  planting, well decomposed cattle manure or compost @ 25-30 tonnes/ha has to be  applied either by broadcasting over the beds prior to planting or applied in  the pits at the time of planting. Application of neem cake @ 2 tonnes/ha at the  time of planting helps in reducing the incidence of rhizome rot disease/  nematode and increasing the yield. <br />
				  The recommended dose  of fertilizer for ginger is 75 kg N, 50 kg P2O5 and 50 kg K2O per ha. The fertilizers are to  be applied in split doses (Table 3). The beds are to be earthed up, after each  top dressing with the fertilizers. In zinc deficient soils basal application of  zinc fertilizer up to 6 kg zinc/ha (30 kg of zinc sulphate/ha) gives good  yield. <br />

				<p><strong>Ginger  Mulching</strong></p>
				<p>       Mulching the beds with  green leaves/organic wastes is essential to prevent soil splashing and erosion  of soil due to heavy rain. It also adds organic matter to the soil, checks weed  emergence and conserves moisture during the latter part of the cropping season.  The first mulching is done at the time of planting with green leaves @ 10-12  tonnes/ha.  Mulching is to be repeated @  7.5 tonnes/ha at 45 and 90 days after planting, immediately after weeding,  application of fertilizers and earthing up. <br />
                    <strong>Intercultivation </strong> <br />
				  Weeding is done just  before fertilizer application and mulching; 2-3 weedings are required depending  on the intensity of weed growth. Proper drainage channels are to be provided  when there is stagnation of water. <br />
				  Earthing up is  essential to prevent exposure of rhizomes and provide sufficient soil volume  for free development of rhizomes. It is done at 45 and 90 days after planting  immediately after weeding and application of fertilizers. <br />
  <strong>Crop rotation and mixed cropping </strong> <br />
				  Crop rotation is  generally followed in ginger. The crops most commonly rotated with ginger are  tapioca, ragi, paddy, gingelly, maize and vegetables. In Karnataka, ginger is  also mix cropped with ragi, red gram and castor. Ginger is also grown as an  intercrop in coconut, arecanut, coffee and orange plantations in Kerala and  Karnataka. However, crop rotation using tomato, potato, chillies, brinjal and  peanut should be avoided, as these plants are hosts for the wilt causing  organism, <em>Ralstonia solanacearum</em>. <br />
  <strong>Plant protection Diseases </strong> <br />
  <strong>Soft rot </strong> <br />
				  Soft rot is the most  destructive disease of ginger which results in total loss of affected clumps.  The disease is soil borne and is caused by <em>Pythium aphanidermatum</em>. <em>P. </em><img width="285" height="213" src="lec01_clip_image005.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/nelsons/Misc/1_ginger_bacterial_wilt_rotting%20_rhizome_1.jpg" /><em>vexans</em> and <em>P. myriotylum </em>are also reported to be associated with  the disease. The fungus multiplies with build up of soil moisture with the  onset of south west monsoon. Younger sprouts are the most susceptible to the  pathogen. The infection starts at the collar region of the pseudo stem and  progresses upwards as well as downwards. The collar region of the affected  pseudo stem becomes water soaked and the rotting spreads to the rhizome  resulting in soft rot. At a later stage root infection is also noticed. Foliar  symptoms appear as light yellowing of the tips of lower leaves which gradually  spreads to the leaf blades. In early stages of the disease, the middle portion  of the leaves remain green while the margins become yellow. The yellowing  spreads to all leaves of the plant from the lower region upwards and is  followed by drooping, withering and drying of pseudo stems. <br />
				  Treatment of seed  rhizomes with Mancozeb 0.3% for 30 minutes before storage and once again before  planting reduces the incidence of the disease. Cultural practices such as  selection of well drained soils for planting is important for managing the  disease, since stagnation of water predisposes the plant to infection. Seed  rhizomes are to be selected from disease free gardens, as the disease is also  seed borne. Application of <em>Trichoderma harzianum</em> along with Neem cake @  1 kg/bed helps in preventing the disease. Once the disease is located in the  field, removal of affected clumps and drenching the affected and surrounding  beds with mancozeb 0.3% checks the spread of the disease. <br />
  <img width="156" height="208" src="lec01_clip_image007.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/nelsons/Misc/1_bacterial_wilt_ginger_1.JPG" /><strong>Bacterial wilt </strong> <br />
				  Bacterial wilt caused  by <em>Ralstonia solanacearum</em> Biovar-3 is also a soil and seed borne disease  that occurs during south west monsoon. Water soaked spots appear at the collar  region of the pseudo stem and progresses upwards and downwards. The first  conspicuous symptom is mild drooping and curling of leaf margins of the lower  leaves which spread upwards. Yellowing starts from the lowermost leaves and  gradually progresses to the upper leaves. In the advanced stage, the plants  exhibit severe yellowing and wilting symptoms. The vascular tissues of the  affected pseudo stems show dark streaks. The affected pseudo stem and rhizome  when pressed gently extrudes milky ooze from the vascular strands. Ultimately rhizomes  rot.<br />
				  The cultural practices  adopted for managing soft rot are also to be adopted for bacterial wilt. Seed  rhizomes must be taken from disease free fields for planting. The seed rhizomes  may be treated with Streptocycline 200 ppm for 30 minutes and shade dried  before planting. Once the disease is noticed in the field all beds should be  drenched with Bordeaux mixture 1% or copper oxychloride 0.2%. <br />
  <strong>Leaf spot </strong> <br />
				  Leaf spot is caused by <em>Phyllosticta zingiberi</em> and the disease is noticed on the leaves from  July to October. The disease starts as water soaked spot and later turns as a <img width="287" height="188" src="lec01_clip_image009.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="http://www.dae.gov.bd/template/NCDP/presentations/ipm_tot_2_files/slide0084_image618.jpg" />white spot surrounded by  dark brown margins and yellow halo. The lesions enlarge and adjacent lesions  coalesce to form necrotic areas. The disease spreads through rain splashes  during intermittent showers. The incidence of the disease is severe in ginger  grown under exposed conditions. The disease can be controlled by regular  spraying of Bordeaux mixture 1% or mancozeb 0.2%. <br />
  <strong>Nematode pests </strong> <br />
				  Root knot (<em>Meloidogyne</em> spp.), burrowing  (<em>Radopholus similis</em>) and lesion (<em>Pratylenchus</em> spp.) nematodes are  important nematode pests of ginger. Stunting, chlorosis, poor tillering and  necrosis of leaves are the common aerial symptoms. Characteristic root galls  and lesions that lead to rotting are generally seen in roots. The infested  rhizomes have brown, water soaked areas in the outer tissues. Nematode  infestation aggravates rhizome rot disease. The nematodes can be controlled by  treating infested rhizomes with hot water (50°C) for 10 minutes, using nematode  free seed rhizomes and solarizing ginger beds for 40 days.  In areas were root knot nematode population  is high, the resistant variety IISR-Mahima may be cultivated. <em>Pochonia  chlamydosporia</em>, a nematode biocontrol agent can be incorporated in ginger  beds (20 g/bed at 106 cfu/g) at the time  of sowing. <br />
  <img width="161" height="161" src="lec01_clip_image010.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /><strong>Insect pests </strong> <br />
  <strong>Shoot borer </strong> <br />
				  The shoot borer (<em>Conogethes  punctiferalis</em>) is the most serious pest of ginger. The larvae bore into  pseudostems and feed on internal tissues resulting in yellowing and drying of  leaves of infested pseudostems. The presence of a bore-hole on the pseudo stem  through which frass is extruded and the withered and yellow central shoot is a  characteristic symptom of pest infestation. The adult is a medium sized moth  with a wingspan of about 20 mm; the wings are orange-yellow with minute black  spots. Fully grown larvae are light brown with sparse hairs. The pest  population is higher in the field during September-October. <br />
				  The shoot borer can be  managed by spraying Malathion (0.1%) at 21 day intervals during July to  October. The spraying is to be initiated when the first symptom of pest attack  is seen on the top most leaves on the pseudostem. An integrated strategy  involving pruning and destroying freshly infested pseudostems during  July-August (at fortnightly intervals) and spraying Malathion (0.1%) during  September-October (at monthly intervals) is also effective against the pest. <br />
  <strong>Rhizome scale </strong> <br />
				  The rhizome scale (<em>Aspidiella  hartii</em>) infests rhizomes in the field (at later stages) and in storage.  Adult (female) scales are circular (about 1 mm diameter) and light brown to  grey and appear as encrustations on the rhizomes. They feed on sap and when the  rhizomes are severely infested, they become shriveled and desiccated affecting  its germination. The pest can be managed by treating the seed material with  Quinalphos (0.075%) (for 20-30 minutes) before storage and also before sowing  in case the infestation persists. Severely infested rhizomes are to be  discarded before storage. <br />
  <strong>Minor pests </strong> <br />
				  Larvae of leaf roller  (<em>Udaspes folus</em>) cut and fold leaves and feed from within. The adults are  medium sized butterflies with brownish black wings with white spots; the larvae  are dark green. A spray with carbaryl (0.1%) or dimethoate (0.05%) may be  undertaken when the infestation is severe. <br />
				  Root grubs  occasionally feed on tender rhizomes, roots and base of pseudostems causing  yellowing and wilting of shoots. The pest can be controlled by drenching the  soil with chloropyriphos (0.075%). <br />
  <strong>Harvesting and curing </strong> <br />
				  The crop is ready for  harvest in about 8 months after planting when the leaves turn yellow, and start  drying up gradually. The clumps are lifted carefully with a spade or digging  fork and the rhizomes are separated from the dried up leaves, roots and  adhering soil. <br />
  <img width="249" height="207" src="lec01_clip_image012.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="Ginger" />       For preparing  vegetable ginger, harvesting is done from sixth month onwards. The rhizomes are  thoroughly washed in water and sun-dried for a day. <br />
				  For preparing dry  ginger, the produce (harvested after 8 months) is soaked in water for 6-7  hours. The rhizomes are then rubbed well to clean the extraneous matter. After  cleaning, the rhizomes are removed from water and the outer skin is removed  with bamboo splinters having pointed ends. Deep scraping may be avoided to  prevent damage of oil cells which are just below the outer skin. The peeled  rhizomes are washed and dried in sun uniformly for 1 week. The dry rhizomes are  rubbed together to get rid of the last bit of skin or dirt. The yield of dry  ginger is 19.­25% of fresh ginger depending on the variety and location where  the crop is grown. <br />
				  Fresh ginger (with  relatively low fibre) harvested at 170-180 days after planting can be used for  preparing salted ginger. Tender rhizomes with a portion of the pseudostem may  be washed thoroughly and soaked in 30% salt solution containing 1% citric acid.  After 14 days it is ready for use and can be stored under refrigeration. <br />
  <strong>Storage of Seed rhizomes </strong> <br />
				  In order to obtain  good germination, the seed rhizomes are to be stored properly in pits under  shade. For seed material, bold and healthy rhizomes from disease free plants  are selected immediately after harvest. For this purpose, healthy and  disease-free clumps are marked in the field when the crop is 6-8 months old and  still green. The seed rhizomes are treated with a solution containing  quinalphos 0.075% and mancozeb 0.3% for 30 minutes and dried under shade. The  seed rhizomes are stored in pits of convenient size in sheds. The walls of the  pits may be coated with cow dung paste. The seed rhizomes are placed in pits in  layers along with well dried sand/saw dust (put one layer of seed rhizomes,  then put 2 cm thick layer of sand/saw dust). Sufficient gap is to be left at  the top of the pits for adequate aeration. The pits can be covered with wooden  planks with one or two small openings for aeration. The seed rhizomes in the  pits may be checked once in about 21 days by removing the plank and shriveled  and disease affected rhizome are to be removed. The seed rhizomes can also be  stored in pits dug in the ground under shade. </p>
