				<p align="center"><strong>TURMERIC</strong><br />
                    <em>(Curcuma longa,<strong> </strong></em>Zingiberaceae)<br />
			    <p>Turmeric is the dried  rhizome of Curcuma longa, an herbaceous plant, and native to tropical south  East Asia. The rhizome has 1.8 to 5.4 percent curcumin, the pigment and 2.5 to  7.2 percent of essential oil. It is used as an important condiment and as a dye  with varied application in drug and cosmetic industries. In India, it is grown  in an area of 104,500 ha producing annually 3, 28,800 tonnes. Although, India  is leading in its production   (75% of  world output), the average productivity and quality are not satisfactory and  these limit our export to about 10 to 15 percent of our production only ,  annually 18 to 20 crores worth of turmeric are exported. In India, Andhra  Pradesh is the leading state followed by Maharastra, Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Kerala  and Bihar. </p>
				<h2>Botany</h2>
				<p>            It is a  herbaceous perennial with a thick under ground rhizome giving rise to primary  and secondary rhizomes called fingers. The leaves are broadly lanceolate with  long stalks. The flowers are born on separate peduncle arising directly from  the rhizome. There are four important species of curcuma. They are (a) <em>Curcuma longa</em>, the widely cultivated  type (b) <em>C.aromatica</em>, the Cochin turmeric or kasturi manjal (c) <em>C.  angustifolia</em>, East Indian arrow root having plenty of starch in its rhizome  and (d) <em>C. amada, mango</em> ginger, which has the taste and flavour of raw  mango.</p>

				<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
				<h2>Climatic and soil</h2>
				<p>       Turmeric can be grown  in diverse tropical condition from sea level to 1500m in the hills, at a  temperature range of 20 to 300C with a rainfall of 1500 to 2250 mm  per annum. It is also grown as an irrigated crop. It is grown in different  types of soil from lights black, loam and red soils to clay loams, but it  thrives best in a well drained sandy rich in humus content.<br />
                    <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
                    <strong>Preparation of land </strong><br />
				  The land is  prepared with the receipt of early monsoon. Soil is brought to a fine giving  about four deep ploughings. Weed, stubbles, roots etc. are removed. Immediately  after the receipt of pre- monsoon showers, beds of 1 to 1.5m width and 15cm  between beds is prepared. Planting is also done by forming ridges and furrows. <br />
  <strong>Planting</strong><br />
				  Kerala and others  west costal areas, crop can be planted during April – May with the receipt of pre-monsoon  showers. In Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, sowing is done during May – June or  July – August. Since turmeric is a shade loving plant, castor or <em>Sesbania  grandifolia </em>may be raised along the borderlines in the field.<br />
  <strong>Seed material </strong><br />
				  Whole or split  mother rhizomes weighing 35 to 44g are used for planting. Well developed  healthy and disease free rhizomes are to be selected. Rhizomes are treated with  0.3 percent Malathion for 30 minutes before storing. Two system of planting  viz. flat beds and ridges and furrows (45cm) methods are adopted in India.  Small pits are made hand hoe in ridges with a spacing of 15cm covered with soil  or dry powdered cattle manure. The optimum spacing in furrows and ridges is  about 45 cm between the rows and 15 cm between the plants. A seed rate of  1500-2000 Kg of rhizomes is required for one hectare.<br />
  <strong>Manure and manuring </strong><br />
				  Farm yard manure  @ 10t/ha is applied as basal dressing. </p>

				<p><strong>Mulching</strong><br />
				  The crop is to be  mulched immediately after planting with green leaves or banana pseudostem or  sugarcane trash at the rate of 12 to 15 tonnes per hectare. It may be repeated  for second time after 50 days with the same quality of green leaves after  weeding and application of fertilizers. <br />
  <strong>After cultivation and growing as intercrop</strong><br />
				  Weeding may be  done thrice at 60, 120, and 150 days after planting depending upon weed  intensity. It can be grown as be raised as mixed crops with chillies,  colocasia, onion, brinjal and cereals like maize, ragi, etc. In some places,  double inter cropping viz., Fenugreek + Onion in turmeric field 15 to 20  irrigations in heavy soils and 35 to 40 in light soil. Moisture stress affects  the growth and development of the rhizome bulking stage.<br />
				  Plant protection <br />
  <strong>Diseases </strong> <br />
				  Leaf blotch <br />
				  Leaf blotch is  caused by <em>Taphrina maculans</em> and appears as small, oval, rectangular or  irregular brown spots on either side of the leaves which soon become dirty  yellow or dark brown. The leaves also turn yellow. In severe cases the plants  present a scorched appearance and the rhizome yield is reduced. The disease can  be controlled by spraying mancozeb 0.2 per cent. </p>

                  </tr>
                </table>
				<p>Leaf spot <br />
				  Leaf spot is  caused by <em>Colletotrichum capsici</em> and appears as brown spots of various  sizes on the upper surface of the young leaves. The spots are irregular in  shape and white or grey in the centre. Later, two or more spots may coalesce and form an  irregular patch covering almost the whole leaf. The affected leaves eventually  dry up. The rhizomes do not develop well. The disease can be controlled by  spraying zineb 0.3 per cent or Bordeaux mixture 1per cent.  <br />
				  Rhizome rot <br />
				  The disease is  caused by <em>Pythium graminicolum </em>or<em> P. aphanidermatum</em>. The collar  region of the pseudo stem becomes soft and water soaked, resulting in collapse  of the plant and decay of rhizomes. Treating the seed rhizomes with mancozeb  0.3 per cent for 30 minutes prior to storage and at the time of sowing prevents  the disease. When the disease is noticed in the field, the beds should be  drenched with mancozeb 0.3 per cent. <br />

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Nematode pests <br />
				  Root knot  nematodes (<em>Meloidogyne</em> spp.) and burrowing nematode (<em>Radopholus  similis</em>) are the two important nematodes causing damage to turmeric. Root  lesion nematodes (<em>Pratylenchus</em> spp.) are of common occurrence in Andhra  Pradesh. Wherever, nematode problems are common, use only healthy,  nematode-free planting material. Increasing the organic content of the soil  also checks the multiplication of nematodes. <em>Pochonia chlamydosporia</em> can  be applied to the beds at the time of sowing @ 20 grams/bed (at 106cfu/g)  for management of nematode problems. <br />
				  Insect pests <br />
				  Shoot borer <br />
				  The shoot borer (<em>Conogethes  punctiferalis</em>) is the most serious pest of turmeric. The larvae bore into  pseudo stems and feed on internal tissues. The presence of a bore-hole on the  pseudo stem through which frass is extruded and the withered central shoot is a  characteristic symptom of pest infestation. The adult is a medium sized moth  with a wingspan of about 20 mm; the wings are orange-yellow with minute black  spots. Fully-grown larvae are light brown with sparse hairs. Spraying Malathion  (0.1%) at 21 day intervals during July to October is effective in controlling  the pest infestation. The spraying has to be initiated when the first symptom  of pest attack is seen on the inner most leaf. <br />
				  Rhizome scale <br />
				  The rhizome scale  (<em>Aspidiella hartii</em>) infests rhizomes in the field (at later stages of  the crop) and in storage. Adult (female) scales are circular (about 1mm  diameter) and light brown to grey and appear as encrustations on the rhizomes.  They feed on sap and when the rhizomes are severely infested, they become  shrivelled and desiccated affecting its germination. Treat seed material with  quinalphos (0.075 per cent) (for 20-30 minutes) before storage and also before  sowing in case the infestation persists. Discard and do not store severely  infested rhizomes. <br />
				  Minor pests <br />
				  Adults and larvae  of leaf feeding beetles such as <em>Lema</em> spp. feed on leaves especially  during the monsoon season and form elongated parallel feeding marks on them.  The spraying of Malathion (0.1 per cent) undertaken for the management of shoot  borer is sufficient to manage this pest. <br />
				  The lace wing bug  (<em>Stephanitis typicus</em>) infests the foliage causing them to turn pale and  dry up. The pest infestation is more common during the post monsoon period  especially in drier regions of the country. Spraying dimethoate (0.05 per cent)  is effective in managing the pest. <br />
				  The turmeric  thrips (<em>Panchaetothrips indicus</em>) infests the leaves causing them to  roll, turn pale and gradually dry up. The pest infestation is more common  during the post monsoon period especially in drier regions of the country.  Spraying dimethoate (0.05 per cent) is effective for the management of the  pest. <br />
  <strong>Harvesting                                                                               </strong><br />
				  Depending upon  the variety, the crop becomes ready for harvest in seven to nine month. Usually  it extends from January – March. Early varieties mature in 7 to 8 month, medium  varieties after 9 month. The land is ploughed and the rhizomes are gathered by  hand picking or the clumps are carefully lifted with a spade. Harvested  rhizomes are cleaned of mud other extraneous matter adhering to them. The  average yield per hectare is 20 to 25 tonnes of green Turmeric.</p>

				<p><strong>Preservation of rhizomes </strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Rhizomes for seed purpose are generally stored after heaping under  the shade of a tree in well ventilated shed and covered with turmeric leaves.  Sometimes the heap is plastered with earth mixed with cow dung. The seed  rhizomes can also be stored in pits with sawdust. The pits can be covered with  wooden planks with one or two holes for aeration.</p>
				<h4>Processing of turmeric</h4>
				<p>            Processing of  turmeric involves three steps   1.  Curing, 2.Polishing and 3.Colouring<br />
                    <strong>1. Curing</strong><br />
				  Fingers are  separated from mother rhizomes and are usually kept as seed material. The fresh  turmeric is cured before marketing. Curing involves boiling of fresh rhizomes  in water and drying in the sun.<br />
  <strong>Traditional method of curing</strong> <br />
				  In the traditional  method, the cleaned rhizomes are boiled in copper or galvanized iron or  earthern vessels, with water just enough to soak them. In certain places, cow  dung slurry is used as boiling medium. From hygienic point of view, such  rhizomes fetch poor market value. Boiling is stopped when froth comes out and  white fumes appear giving out a typical odour. The boiling lasts for 45 to 60  minutes when the rhizomes are soft. Over cooking spoils the colour of the final  product. While under cooking renders the dried product brittle.<br />
  <strong>Improved scientific method of curing</strong> <br />
				  In this method of  curing the cleaned fingers (approximately 50 kg) are taken in a perforated  trough of size 0.9×0.55×0.4 m, made of GI or MS sheet with extended parallel  handle. The perforated trough containing the fingers is then immersed in the  pan. The alkaline solution (0.1% sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate) is  poured into the trough so as to immerse the turmeric fingers. The wholesome is  boiled till the fingers become soft. The cooked fingers are taken out of the  pan by lifting the trough and draining the solution into the pan. Alkalinity of  the boiling water helps in imparting orange yellow tinge to the core of  turmeric.<br />
				  The drained  solution in the pan can also be used for boiling another lot of turmeric along  with the fresh solution prepared for the purpose. The cooking of turmeric is to  be done within two or three days after harvesting. The mother rhizomes and the  fingers are generally cured separately.<br />
				  The cooked  fingers are dried in the sun by spreading 5 to 7 cm thick layers on bamboo mat  or drying floor. A thinner layer is not desirable, as the colour of the dried  product may be adversely affected. During night time, the materials should be  heaped or covered. It may take 10 to 15 days for the rhizomes to become  completely dry. The yield of the dry product varies from 20 to 30 percent  depending upon the location where the crop is grown.<br />
  <strong>2. Polishing        </strong><br />
				  Dried turmeric has  poor appearance and a rough dull outer surface with scales and root bits. The  appearance is improved by smoothening and polishing outer surface by manual or  mechanical rubbing.<br />
  <strong>Manual polishing</strong>: It consists of rubbing  the dried turmeric fingers on a hard surface or trampling them under feet,  wrapping in gunny bags. <br />
  <strong>Improved method</strong>: The improved method is  by using hand operated barrel or drum mounted on a central axis, the sides of  which are made of expanded metal mesh. When the drum filled with turmeric is  rotated at 30 rpm, polishing is effected by abrasion of the surface against the  mesh as well as by mutual rubbing against each other as they roll inside the  drum. The turmeric is also polished in power- operated drums. The yield of  polished turmeric from the raw materials varies from 15 to 25 percent.<br />
  <strong>3. Colouring</strong><br />
				  It is done to  give a good appearance and better finish to the product. This is done to half  polished rhizomes in two ways, known as dry and wet colouring.<br />
  <strong>       Dry colouring</strong>: Turmeric powder is added to the polishing drum in the last 10  minutes in dry process.<br />
  <strong>       Wet colouring</strong>: In this process, turmeric powder is suspended in water and mixed  by sprinkling inside the polishing basket. For giving a brighter colour the  boiled, dried and half polished fingers are taken in baskets which are shaken  continuously when an emulsion is poured in. When the fingers are uniformly  coated with the emulsion, they may be dried in the sun. The composition of the  emulsion required for coating, 100 kg of half boiled turmeric is as follows, Alum  0.04 kg, Sodium bisulphate 30 g, Turmeric powder 2.00 kg, Conc. HCl  30 ml and Castor seed oil 0.14 kg</p>
