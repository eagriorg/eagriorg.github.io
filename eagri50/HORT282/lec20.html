				<p align="center"><br />
				  <img src="lec20_clip_image002.jpg" alt="" width="361" height="245" hspace="12" align="left" />            The oil palm tree is a tropical  plant which commonly grows in warm climates at altitudes of less than 1,600  feet above sea level. The species, <em>Elaeis </em>oleifera (H.B.K) Cortes is native of America; and the species <em>Elaeis guineensis Jacq.</em> which originated  in the Gulf of Guinea in West Africa (hence its scientific name) is better  known as the African oil palm. <br />
				  This  tree produces one of the most popular edible oils in the world - a versatile  oil of superb nutritional value. It is the most prolific of all oil plants and  in commercial terms the one which offers major prospects of development.<br />

				<p align="center"><strong>Botany</strong><br />
				  <strong>Plant</strong> <br />
				  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oil palm can reach 60-80 ft in height in nature, but is  rarely more than 20 or 30 ft in cultivation. Leaf bases are persistent for  years, and prominent leaf scars are arranged spirally on the trunk of mature  palms where bases have fallen. Leaves are&nbsp; up to 25 ft in length, with  leaflets numbering 200-300 per leaf, about 3-4 ft long and 1.5 - 2.0&quot;  wide, with entire margins. Leaflets cover the distal 2/3 of the leaf, and the  lower 1/3 is spined with spines increasing in length acropetally. <br />
				  <strong>Flowers </strong><br />
				  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oil palms are monoecious, producing male and female  inflorescences in leaf axils. The inflorescence of both sexes is a compound  spadix with 100-200 branches, initially enclosed in a spathe or bract that  splits 2 weeks prior to anthesis.<br />
				  <strong>Fruit </strong><br />
				  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As in many palms, fruits are drupes. The mesocarp and  endocarp vary in thickness, with Dura  types having thick endocarps and less mesocarp, and Tenera types the opposite.&nbsp; The exocarp color is green  changing to orange at maturity in virescens  types, and orange with brown or black cheek colors in the Nigrescens types. Fruit range in size  from &lt;1&quot; to 2&quot;, and are obovoid in shape. The mesocarp, from which  palm oil is derived, is fibrous and oily, and the seed is opaque white, encased  in a brown endocarp; palm kernel oil is derived from seeds. The female  inflorescence contains 200-300 fruit, and fruit set is 50-70%. Fruit ripen  about 5-6 months after pollination.</p>

                <p><br />
                  <strong>Climate and Soil</strong><br />
                  Oil  palm grows best in areas with a mean maximum temperature of 30-32 ºC and on an  average of at least five hours of sunlight. It can be grown in areas, which  receive well-distributed annual rainfall of 200 cm or more. However, it can  tolerate two to four months of dry spell. <br />
                  Soil - wide range of soil types  provided good drainage and pH between 4 and 7; tolerates periodic flooding or a  high water table; many soils are alluvial in nature. The  adult palms can withstand occasional water logging, but frequently waterlogged,  extremely sandy and hard lateritic soils should be avoided. Irrigation is generally not practiced. <br />
  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
                  &nbsp;There are three naturally occurring forms of the  oil palm fruit, termed<em> Dura, Tenera</em>, and <em>Pisifera</em>. Most cultivars  are the <em>Tenera</em> form which produces fruit with higher oil content. The  only variety recommended for commercial cultivation is <em>Tenera</em>, which is a hybrid between <em>Dura </em>and <em>Pisifera.</em><br />
  <strong>Nursery practices </strong> <br />
                  The  fruits are separated from the bunch and seeds are extracted by scraping off the  exocarp and mesocarp with a knife, or by retting in water. The seeds are then  dried by spreading them on concrete or wooden floors under shade for two days.  Such seeds can be stored for 3-9 months at about 27 ºC without much reduction  in viability.<br />
                  Seeds  are soaked in water for five days, changing the water daily. Thereafter, the  seeds are spread out to dry for 24 hours. The dried seeds are put in polythene  bags and placed in germinator maintained at a temperature of 40 ºC. After 80  days, the seeds are removed from polythene bags, soaked in water for 5 days  changing the water daily and dried in the shade for two hours. The seeds are  then put back into bags and kept in a cool place in order to maintain the  moisture content. Germination commences in about 10-12 days. The percentage of  germination obtainable by this method is 90-95.<br />
  <strong>Raising nursery</strong> <br />
                  Polybags  (preferably black) of 400-500 gauge measuring 40 x 35 cm are used. The bags are  filled with topsoil and compost and are arranged at a spacing of 45 x 45 cm and  one sprouted seed is dibbled per bag. A good mulching during summer is  desirable. <br />
  <img src="lec20_clip_image012.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="311" hspace="12" align="left" /> <br />
                  Watering  the seedlings weekly thrice is recommended. A fertilizer mixture containing 15  g N, 15 g P2O5 and 6 g K2O at the rate of 8 g  in five litres of water for 100 seedlings may be applied when the seedlings are  two month and eight month old.<br />
  <strong>Planting </strong> <br />
                  Oil  palm is planted in the main field in triangular system at spacing of 9 m  accommodating 140 palms per ha. Planting is preferably done at the onset of  monsoon during May-June. The polythene bag is torn open and the entire ball of  earth is buried in the pit (50 x 50 x 50 cm) and levelled. <br />
  <strong>Leaf  pruning</strong><br />
                  Dead  and diseased leaves and all inflorescences should be cut off regularly up to  three years after planting. When the palms are yielding, judicious pruning to  retain about 40 leaves on the crown is advocated. It is necessary to remove  some of the leaves while harvesting. In such cases, care should be taken to  avoid over pruning. In addition, all dead and excess leaves should be cut off  and crown cleaned at least once in a year, usually during the dry season.<br />
  <strong>Pollination</strong> <br />
                  Oil  palm is a cross-pollinated crop. Assisted pollination is done to ensure  fertilization of all female flowers. However, this is not necessary if the  pollination weevil <em>Elaedobius kamerunicus</em> is introduced in the plantation. They congregate and multiply on male  inflorescence during flower opening. The weevils also visit the female flowers  and pollinate them effectively.<br />
  <strong>&nbsp;Manuring </strong> <br />
                  The following fertilizer schedule is  considered satisfactory for oil palm.</p>
                <div align="center">
                  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="331">

                </div>
                <p>            Mg  application is necessary only if deficiency symptoms are noticed. Fertilizers  are preferably applied in two equal split doses (May and September), within 2 m  diameter around the palm and forked in. Supply of sufficient quantities of  green leaf or compost is advantageous, especially where the soil is poor in  organic matter.<br />
                  <strong>Weed management</strong> <br />
                  The  field has to be regularly maintained to allow access for harvesting and palm  inspection. The weeded circle should be sufficiently kept clear of vegetation  for loose fruit collection. It is also extremely important to reduce direct  weed competition in young palms. This can be controlled manually or chemically  using herbicide.                </p>
                <p><strong>Pruning and Training</strong> <br />
                  Old leaves are pruned off to  facilitate access to the bunch at harvest. When palms reach heights of 20-30  ft, they become difficult to harvest, and are often injected with an herbicide  to kill them or bulldozed down. New trees are planted among the dead and  rotting trunks. <br />
  <strong>Pest management</strong><br />
  <strong>Rhinoceros beetle</strong> <br />
                  The  pest causes severe damage to emerging fronds and spindle. The adult beetle  feeds on the softer tissue of the rachis, resulting in snapping off of the  fronds and spears at the feeding sites. Field sanitation and elimination of  breeding sites are essential components of the pest management operation. This  pest can be suppressed by using the virus Baculovirus oryctes.<br />
  <strong>Red palm weevil</strong> <br />
                  This  is a major pest of oil palm in India. These weevils lay their eggs at the cut  end of petioles or other wounds. The emerging larvae tunnel into the crown and  feed on the growing tissues. Palms infested by red palm weevil start wilting  and leaves show gradually increasing chlorosis and fracture in strong winds. If  detected early, treatment of affected palm with 0.2% solution of endosulfan or  1% carbaryl would save the palms. <br />
  <strong>Birds</strong> <br />
                  Many  birds such as the forest crow, the house crow and the common Indian myna cause  severe damage to oil palm fruit bunches. These birds feed on the mesocarp of  the oil palm fruits. The damage can be minimized by scaring the birds and  covering the ripe bunch with wire net, 150 days after fruit set.<br />
  <strong>Disease management</strong><br />
  <strong>Anthracnose</strong> <br />
                  This  disease occurs in the nursery. It is recognized by regular or irregular brown  to black leaf blotches surrounded by yellow haloes, which develop along the  margin, centre or tip of the leaves. It causes heavy seedling loss. The disease  can be controlled by spraying mancozeb or captan at the rate of 200 g/100  litres of water. Copper fungicides should not be used because of the extreme  susceptibility of oil palm seedlings to copper burn (scorching).<br />
  <strong>Spear rot</strong> <br />
                  This  is noticed to affect oil palms of all ages. The incidence is less than one per  cent. Yellowing starts from tip of the innermost whorl of leaves. Small lesions  occur at the distal portions of spear and rotting extends downwards. As the  disease advances, new leaves become rudimentary and show rotting. General  decline in vigour and production is then noticed. Occurrence of spear rot without  yellowing has also been noticed. Distinguishable marginal yellowing of leaflets  and sudden drying of leaves showing yellowing are other symptoms. Rouging of  all the affected palms may be adopted to prevent further spread of the disease.  In early stages of the disease, the affected portions of leaves may be removed  and burnt.<br />
  <strong>Bunch failure</strong> <br />
                  Sparse  or no fruit set followed by complete drying or rotting of the affected bunches  are the typical symptoms. The extent of incidence can be up to 20%. This malady  is generally attributed to excess pruning, mutual shading, under pollination,  moisture stress and unhygienic conditions. The situation can be improved by  assisted pollination as well as by adopting hygienic measures like removal of  infected bunches and dry male inflorescence.<br />
  &nbsp;<strong>Harvesting</strong> <br />
                  As fruit ripen, they change from  black (or green in <em>virescens</em> types) to orange, but have varying degrees  of black cheek color depending on light exposure and cultivar. However, fruit  abscission is the best index of bunch ripeness. <br />
                  First  harvest can be taken 3.5 to 4 years after planting. When a few ripe fruits are  loose / fall off, the bunch is ready for harvesting. Processing over-ripe  fruits reduces quantity and quality of oil.<br />
                  A  chisel is used for harvesting bunches from young palms. The stalk of the bunch  is struck hard with the chisel to cut off and push the bunch out. When the  palms become taller (from 10 year onwards) a harvesting hook has to be used.  When the palms are too tall, it is necessary to climb the palms for harvesting.  Each tree must be visited  every 10-15 days as bunches ripen throughout the year. <br />
  <strong>Processing</strong>&nbsp;<br />
                  <a name="average" id="average">Oil extraction is a  complex process, carried out by large mills that may process up to 60 tons of  fruit per hour, or by small scale mills in rural villages that produce only  about 1 ton of oil in an 8 hour shift. Oil extraction from fruit follows the  same basic steps in either case:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Steam sterilization of bunches (inactivates lipase  enzymes and kills microorganisms that produce free fatty acids, reducing oil  quality)</a><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Stripping fruit  from bunches<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Crushing,  digestion, and heating of the fruit<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4. Oil extraction  from macerated fruit (hydraulic pressing)<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5. Palm oil  clarification<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;6. Separating fiber  from the endocarp<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;7. Drying, grading,  and cracking of the endocarp<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8. Separating the  endocarp from the kernel<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;9. Kernel drying  and packing<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  product of step 5 is termed crude palm oil, which must be refined to remove  pigments, free fatty acids, and phospholipids, and to deodorize it. The final  product, termed &quot;refined, bleached, deodorized&quot; palm oil is produced.<br />
