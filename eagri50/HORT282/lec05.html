				<p align="center"><strong>CORIANDER</strong><br />
				  <em>(Coriandrum  sativum,</em><strong> </strong>Apiaceae)<strong></strong><br />
				  Coriander is an annual  herb, mainly cultivated for its fruits as well as for the tender green leaves.  It is native of the Mediterranean region and is now commercially grown in  India, Morocco, U.S.S.R, Hungary, Poland, Rumania, Czechoslovakia, Guatemala,  Mexico and the U.S.A. In India, it is grown in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu,  Karnataka, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. It is grown in about 3.51 lakhs  hectares with an annual production 1, 67,700 tonnes of grains. Major portion is  though consumed locally; a small quantity is being exported now. But our  country has ambitious plan to increase the report of coriander to a tune of  9000 tonnes by 2000 A.D.<br />
				  The fruits have a  fragrant odour and pleasant aromatic taste. The odour and taste are due to the  essential oil content which varies from 0.1 to 1.0 percent in the dry seeds.  These essential oils are used for flavouring liquors, cocoa preparations in  confectionary and also to mask the offensive odours in pharmaceutical preparations.  The dried ground fruits are the major ingredient of the curry powder. The whole  fruits are also used to flavour foods like pickles, sauces and confectionary.  The young plants as well as the leaves are used in the preparation of chutney  and are also used as seasoning in curries, soups, sauces and chutneys. It has  medicinal properties too. Fruits are said to have carminative, diuretic, tonic,  stomachic and aphrodisiac properties.<br />
  <strong>Botany</strong><br />
  <strong>       </strong>Coriander belongs to the family Apiaceae. It is a smooth, erect  annual herb 30-70 cm high lower leaves broad with crenately lobed margins, upper leaves finely  cut with lineary lobes, flowers small, white or pink in compound terminal  umbels, fruits- schizocarp, globular, yellow-brown, ribbed 2 seeds, and ripe  seeds are aromatic.</p>

                <p><strong>Climate and soil</strong><br />
                  <strong>             </strong>It is a tropical crop and can be grown  throughout the year for leaf purposes, but for higher than grain yield it has  to be grown in specific season. A dry and cold weather free from frost, especially  during flowering and fruit setting stage favours good grain production. Cloudy  weather during flowering and fruiting stage favours pest and disease  incidences. Heavy rain affects the crop. As an irrigated crop, it can be  cultivated on almost all types of soils provided sufficient organic matter is  applied. Black cotton soils with high retentivity of moisture are best under  rainfed conditions.<strong>   </strong><br />

                <p><strong>Field  preparation                                                                                                 </strong><br />
                  For raising crop, the  land is ploughed 3 to 4 times following rains<strong> </strong>and field must be planted immediately to break the clods and to  avoid soil moisture. For irrigated crop the land is ploughed twice or thrice  and beds and channels are formed.<strong>  </strong><br />
  <strong>Season of cultivation</strong><br />
                  In the North and  Central parts of India and Andhra Pradesh, It is mostly grown as a rabi season  crop and hence sowing is done between middle of October and middle of November.  Still late sowing is recommended in places vulnerable for frost damage. In  certain pockets of the above area, late kharif crop is sometimes sown in  August-September. In Tamil Nadu, as an irrigated crop, coriander is raised in  June-July and Sep-Oct. In the first season, it matures early before the end of  Aug-Sep. In the second season, it matures late with an extended growth phase  during Jan-Feb. The growth and the yield of second season crop is found to be  better than the first season crop. Under rainfed conditions, it is sown during  Sep-Oct, at the onset of North east monsoon and harvested during Jan-Feb.<br />
  <strong>Sowing</strong><br />
  <strong>        </strong>A seed rate of 10 to 15 kg per hectare is  required. Seeds are stored for 15-30 days record better and early germination  than freshly harvested seeds. Seeds are soaked in water for 12 to 24 hours  before sowing also enhances and treated with thiram at 2g per kg of seeds. For  irrigated crop, sowing is generally done in rows spaced at 30-40 cm apart with  15 cm between hills. Soil depth should not exceed 3.0 cm. Three to five seeds  are sown a hill and later on thinned to two plants per hill. Under rainfed  condition seeds are broadcast and covered  with country plough. Germination takes place in 10-15 days.<br />
  <strong>Manuring</strong><br />
  <strong>       </strong>About 10 tonnes of farm yard manure is applied at the time of last  preparation. In addition, the following fertilizers may be applied. Irrigated  crop 15:40:20Kg/ha NPK as basal and 15 kg N at 30DAS, Rainfed crop 20:30:20 kg  NPK/ha<br />
  <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
                  First irrigation is  given 3 days after sowing and thereafter at 10 – 15 days interval depending  upon the soil moisture available in the soil.<br />
  <strong>After cultivation</strong><br />
                  The first hoeing and  weeding are given in about 30 days. Thinning the plants is also attended  simultaneously, leaving only 2 plants per hill. Depending upon the growth 1 or  2 more weedings are done.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting</strong><br />
                  The crop will be ready  for harvest in about 90 -110 days depending upon the varieties and growing  seasons. In certain varieties, harvesting 50% leaves at 60 days 75 days may be  done which will fetch additional income but without affecting the grain yield.  Harvesting has to be done when the fruits are fully ripe and start changing  from green to brown colour. Delaying of the harvest should be avoided lest  shattering during harvest and splitting of the fruits in subsequent processing  operations. The plants are cut or pulled and piled in to small stacks in the  field wither for 2- 3 days the fruits are then threshed out from the plants by  beating with sticks or rubbing with the hands. The produce is winnowed, cleaned  and dried in partial shade. After drying, the produce is stored in gunny bags  lined with paper.  The rainfed crop  yields on an average 400 – 500 kg/ha and the irrigated crop 600 -1200 kg/ha. </p>

                <p><strong>Plant protection</strong> <br />
                  At the seedling  stage coriander is often attacked by the leaf eating caterpillars and  semi-loopers and at the flowering stage by the aphids. Spraying the crop with  methyl demeton (0.05 %) is recommended to control aphids but at flowering stage  the use of any insecticide would kill the bee population affecting pollination  in the crop.<br />
                  Powdery mildew (<em>Erysiphe polygoni</em>) is a serious  disease which ruin the crop if allowed unchecked in the initial stage itself.  Spraying wettable sulphur 0.25 % or 0.2 % solution of karathane twice at 10-15  days interval is recommended. Grain mold is caused by <em>Helminthosporium </em>sp, <em>Alternaria </em>sp<strong>, </strong><em>Carvularia </em>sp and <em>Fusarium </em>sp<strong>.</strong> It can be controlled  by spraying carbendazim 0.1 % 20 days after grain set.<br /></p>
