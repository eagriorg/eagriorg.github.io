				  <strong>Therapeutic uses</strong><br />
				  Its  dried seeds or beans, and sometimes its bark (called <em>nux vomica</em>) are  used in herbal remedies. The seeds contain organic substances, strychnine and  brucine, that are used in herbal remedies. Dried seeds of kuchila are nervine, stomachic, and cardio-tonic,  aphrodisiac, and respiratory stimulant. It is used as a remedy in chronic  dysentery, paralytic and neuralgic disorders, epilepsy, rheumatic arthritis,  and hydrophobia. In excessive doses, <em>Strychnos </em>is a virulent poison,  producing stiffness of muscles and convulsions, ultimately leading to death. It  is an important drug in all systems of medicine.<br />
				  <strong>Morphological characteristics</strong><br />
				  <em>            Strychnos </em>species is a medium-sized, deciduous tree, with fairly straight  and cylindrical bole and dark-grey or yellowish-grey bark with minute  tubercles. The nux vomica grows as tall as 49.2 ft (15 m). The nux  vomica has roundish, opposite leaves and attractive white flowers. Leaves are simple,  opposite, orbicular to ovate, 6–12 cm long and 6–10 cm broad, coriaceous,  glabrous, and five-nerved.<br />
				  <strong>Floral characteristics</strong><br />
				  Flowers  of kuchila are white or greenish white and fragrant. They occur in many  flowered terminal cymes. Calyx is five lobed, pubescent, and small, about 2 mm  in size, while corolla is salver shaped and has five lobes. Corolla tube is  cylindrical, greenish white inside and slightly hairy near the base. Stamens  are five in number and have short filaments. The roughly  spherical fruits of the nux  vomica are large hard-rinded berries that contain three to eight round,  flattened, grayish seeds. These  seeds are covered with silky hairs, are known as strychnine nuts, and are hard  and extremely bitter in taste. The seeds of the nux vomica contain several  alkaloids that are useful for some purposes, particularly strychnine, and to a  lesser extent brucine Fruit is an indehiscent berry, 5–6 cm in diameter, thick  shelled, orange- red when ripe with fleshy pulp. Seeds are discoid, compressed,  and coin like, concave on one side and convex on the other, and covered with  fine grey silky hairs. Flowering occurs from March to May and fruits mature up  to December.<br />
				  <strong>Distribution</strong><br />
				  <em>Strychnos nux-vomica</em> is the name of an evergreen tree native to south East Asia, especially India  and Myanmar, and cultivated elsewhere. The range of the nux vomica in  cultivation extends from Sri Lanka, southern China, southeast Asia, and northern Australia. The species is  indigenous to India and is distributed in moist deciduous forests throughout  the tropical India<strong></strong><br />

                <p><strong>Climate and soil</strong><br />
                  The plant can grow well in dry or humid tropical areas of  the country. It grows over laterite, sandy, and alluvial soil<br />
                  <strong>Propagation  material</strong><br />
                  Seeds are the best material for propagation of kuchila  plant. The collected seeds are dried in the sun after removing the pulp.  Preferably, fresh seeds should be used. The plant can also be propagated  through cuttings.<br />
  <strong>Nursery technique</strong><br />
  <strong>Raising propagules</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>A nursery of the plant  is raised in December or January in climatic conditions of South India. Seeds  are sown in polybags of size 25 cm × 20 cm, filled with soil, sand, and FYM  (farmyard manure) mixture. Seeds are directly sown in the polybags after  appropriate pretreatment. The polybags are watered regularly so as to keep them  moist. The seeds germinate in about 20–30 days. Sometimes the germination may  continue up to 45 days. The seedling growth is very slow but roots grow very  fast. For vegetative propagation, semi-hardwood cuttings can be prepared in  early summer and kept under moist conditions after treating with commercially  available rooting hormones. Rooting percentage is quite low, often less than  25%.<br />
  <strong>Propagule rate and pretreatment</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>About 1 kg seeds are  required to raise 1 hectare of plantation. Seeds have low germination rate and  fresh seeds of <em>Strychnos nux-vomica </em>lose viability early. Germination  can be increased by treating the seeds with hot water (50 °C) for 6–12 hours  prior to sowing. <br />
  <strong>Planting in the field</strong><br />
  <img src="lec29_clip_image010.gif" alt="" width="260" height="204" hspace="12" align="left" /><strong>Land preparation and fertilizer</strong><strong>application</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The land is ploughed  with disc harrow and tillers to achieve a fine tilth and make it weed-free and  arable. Pits of size 45 cm × 45 cm × 45 cm are dug at a spacing of 5 m × 5 m  and refilled with mixture of soil and manure in 1:1 ratio. Appropriate  quantities of sand may be added if the soil is heavy. About 10 kg of  well-rotten FYM is applied in each pit at the time of its refilling. <br />
  <strong>Transplanting and optimum spacing</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>In South India, the  seedlings are transplanted with the onset of South-west monsoon in May or early  June. An optimum spacing of 5 m × 5 m is recommended, which gives a stand of  400 trees per hectare. P <em>Intercropping system </em>The plant can be grown as  a pure crop or herbaceous crops can be grown with it as intercrops after the  first year. <br />
  <strong>Interculture and maintenance  practices</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>About 10 kg of  well-rotten FYM is mixed in the soil during refilling of pits before planting.  Additional 10 kg manure may again be applied to the soil around the plants  during October–November at the time of weeding. A total of 20 kg FYM/plant/year  in subsequent years results in best growth of plants. This is to be applied in  two split doses in June–July and September–October. Supplementary doses of  inorganic fertilizers (NPK [nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium]) do not lead  to any significant additional growth in the young plantations. The area around  the basin of the plant should be kept weed-free by frequent weeding. The  interspaces can be kept weed-free by hand weeding or spraying of herbicides  like 0.8% paraquat or 0.4% Glyphosate.<br />
  <strong>Irrigation practices</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The crop needs no  irrigation during the rainy season and in dry weather; saplings may be  irrigated on alternate days, especially in the early years of growth. For  matured trees, irrigation by ring method around tree base at a distance of 30  cm during summer months is beneficial.<br />
  <strong>Disease and pest control</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>No significant pest or  disease is observed on the crop.<br />
  <strong>Harvest management</strong><br />
  <strong>Crop maturity and harvesting</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The tree has a long span  of life, that is, 50–60 years. It takes about 15–20 years for the tree to  initiate flowering. The seeds are collected December onwards when they mature.  Fruits can be harvested periodically for many years.<br />
  <strong>Post-harvest management</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Mature fruits are manually collected and seeds from them are  extracted, washed, dried in shade, and stored for trade.<br />
  <strong>Chemical constituents</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Strychnine and brucine  are two most important and toxic alkaloids present in the seeds (0.4% and 0.6%,  respectively). Other parts of tree have varying percentages of these two  alkaloids— 1.7% and 2.8% in root bark, 0.3% and 0.4% in root-wood, 0.9% and  2.1% in stem-bark, 0.5% and 0.01% in stem-wood, and 0.2% and<br />
                  0.5% in leaves,  respectively. <br />
  <strong>Yield and cost of cultivation</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Considering a crop stand  of 400 plants per hectare and average produce range of 50–75 kg of dry seeds  per tree per year, a yield of 12–20 tonnes/hectare is estimated from a  20-yearold plantation annually. The estimated cost of raising 1 hectare  plantation in the first year is Rs. 100 000 only, while an amount of  approximately Rs. 6500 per hectare is incurred per year in subsequent years. </p>
                <p><strong>Use</strong><br />
                  In  herbal medicine, <em>Strychnos nux-vomica</em> is recommended for liver cancer,  upset stomach, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, intestinal irritation,  hangovers, heartburn, insomnia, certain heart diseases, circulatory problems,  eye diseases, depression, migraine headaches, nervous conditions, problems  related to menopause, and respiratory diseases in the elderly. What does it  involve? <br />
                  The  seeds of the <em>Strychnos nux-vomica</em> tree are removed from the ripened  berries of the tree and dried in the sun. Sometimes they are heated or further  processed, which may reduce the amount of poison in the seeds. Various herbal  preparations are made from the dried seeds, including tablets, liquid extracts,  and tinctures. </p>
