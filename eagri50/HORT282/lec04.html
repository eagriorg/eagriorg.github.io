				  <em>(Elettaria  cardamom,</em><strong> </strong>Zingiberaceae)</p>
                <p>       Cardamom, popularly  known as Queen of Spices is native to the evergreen rainy forests of Western  Ghats in South India. It is cultivated in about 1, 00,000 ha mainly confined to  the Southern States viz; Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu accounting for 60,31  and 9% of the total area respectively. Our annual production is about 40000  metric tonnes and nearly 40% of which is exported to more than 60 countries  earning a foreign exchange of nearly 60 million rupees. Cardamom is used for  flavouring various preparations of food, confectionary, beverages and liquors.<br />
                  <strong>Botany</strong><br />
                  Cardamom is an  herbaceous perennial having underground rhizomes. The aerial pseudostem is made  of leaf sheaths. Inflorescence is a long panicle with racemose clusters arising  from the underground stem, but comes up above the soil. Flowers are bisexual,  fragrant, fruit is trilocular capsule. Flower initiation takes place in March –  April and from initiation to full bloom, it takes nearly 30 days and from bloom  to maturity, it takes about 5 to 6 months. Honeybee is the principal  pollinating agent and it increases the fruit set considerably when compared to  flowers prevented from bee visits. Cardamom flowers remain open for about 16 to  18 hours and stigma receptivity and pollen viability are maximum during morning  hours. </p>

                <p>       Four to five beehives  per ha should be maintained and pesticides spraying should be maintained and  pesticides spraying should be carefully monitored to avoid any damage to the  bees.  Large cardamom or Nepal cardamom  or Great Indian cardamom is the dried fruits of <em>Amomum subulatum</em>. It is  the native of Eastern Himalayan region and is now cultivated in Sikkim,  Darjeeling and Assam hills in about 23000 ha in India with an annual production  of 3250 tonnes. About 150 tonnes are annually exported earning around Rs 70  lakh. It is a perennial crop, propagated from the seeds or cut bits of the  rhizome. It starts bearing in 3 to 5 years after planting and the economic age  of the plantation is 12 to 15 years. The fruits are about2.5 cm long, ovoid and  triangular in shape brown or pink in colour when ripe. They contain 40 to 50  seeds. Average yield is 300 to 1000 kg from 4th or 5th  year.</p>
                <p><strong>Climate and Soil</strong><br />
                  The natural habitat of  cardamom is the evergreen forests of the Western Ghats. It is grown in the  areas where the annual rainfall ranges from 1500 to 4000 mm, with a temperature  range of 10 to 35 C and an altitude of 600 to 1200 m above MSL. Rainfall  distribution should be good and summer showers during February – April are  essential for panicle initiation, otherwise it will affect the yield.  With the denudation of the forests in the  Western and Eastern Ghats, the favourable ecosystem has been affected  destabilizing the macroclimate and rainfall in the cardamom growing tracts,  resulting in poor growth and yield.<br />
  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
                  Based on the size of the fruit, two varieties are broadly  recognized via; Elaterid cardamom var. major consisting of wild indigenous  types and var. minor comprising the cultivated types via; Mysore, Malabar and  Vazhukka (natural breed between Mysore and Malabar). These types are identified  mainly based on the nature of panicle and shape and size of fruits as follows.</p>

                <p><strong>Propagation and nursery</strong><br />
                  Cardamom is propagated  mainly through seeds and also through suckers each consisting of atleast one  old and a young aerial shoot. <br />
  <strong>1. Clonal Propagation: </strong>The suckers are commonly used for gap filling but suckers may not  be available in larger numbers. Therefore, a rapid Clonal multiplication  technique evolved by Indian Institute of Spice Research, Cardamom Research  Centre, Appangala, is proved to be quick, reliable and economic for production  of large number of quality planting materials. The site selected for this  method should have a gentle slope and have a water source nearby it. Trenches  of 45cm width, 45 cm depth and of any convenient length may be taken across the  slope or along the contour at 1.8 m apart. The top 20 cm depth soil is  excavated separately and heaped on the upper side of the trench. The lower 25  cm is excavated and heaped on the lower side of the trenches all along the  line. The top soil is mixed with equal portions of top soil is mixed with equal  proportions of humus rich jungle soil, sand and cattle manure and filled back  by leaving a depression of 5 cm at the top to facilitate mulching for retention  of soil mixture. Suckers, each consisting of one grown up tiller and a growing  young shoot, are placed at a distance of 0.6 m distance in the trenches during  March-October. Regular cultural operations are to be followed including high  fertilizer dosed 100:50:200 kg NPK/ha in 6 split doses at 60 days interval  along with Neem cake at 250 g/plant. Irrigation should be provided atleast  twice in a week. Overhead pandal at a height of 3.6 m covered with coir mat or  leafy twigs of any shade tree may be provided during the non-rainy season.  Within a period of 12 months, a plant would produce atleast 32 to 42 suckers,  which may yield atleast 16 to 21 planting units per ha of clonal nursery within  12 months of planting<br />
  <strong>2. Seed propagation:</strong> Seedlings are normally raised in primary and secondary nurseries.  The nursery site should be selected on gentle sloppy lands, having an easy  access to a water source. Raised beds are prepared after digging the lands to a  depth of 30- 45 cm. The beds of 1 m width and convenient length raised to a  height of about 30 cm are prepared. A fine layer of humus rich forest soil is  spread over the beds. Seeds should be collected from well ripe capsules.  Immediately after the harvesting, the husk is removed and the seeds are washed  repeatedly in water for removing the mucilaginous coating. After draining the  water, the seeds are to be mixed with wood ash and dried in shade for a day. In  order to ensure uniform and early germination, seeds should be sown immediately  after extraction. If the sowing is delayed, pre-sowing treatment of seeds with  25% Nitric acids for 10 minutes is advisable to get a quick and higher  germination. One kg of seed capsule may produce 5000 seedlings (600g seeds).</p>

                </div>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>       Sowing may be taken up during November- January and is done in  rows. Deep sowing of seeds has to be avoided for quick and better germination.  Seedbeds are to be dusted with Lindane.   Beds are mulched to a thickness of 2 cm with paddy straw or any locally  available material and are watered regularly. The germination commences in  about a 30 bags and may continue for a month or two. After germination, the  mulch is to be removed. An overhead pandal with a height of 2 m is quite  desirable. Materials like coir mat, plaited leaves or tree twigs which do not  shed their leaves may be used but the coir mat is preferable as it provides uniform  filtered sunlight. The excess seedlings are to be thinned out after 75-80 days  sowing. The thinned out seedlings can be used for gap filling within the  nursery bed or for raising secondary nursery. When the seedlings attain 5-6  leaf stages, light earthing up is to be done. This would encourage better  tillering and proper growth of seedlings.<br />
                  Generally in  Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the seedlings are transplanted to the secondary nursery  when they attain four to six leaf stages. The beds are prepared in the same  manner as that of a primary nursery. The seedlings are transplanted in March-  May at a spacing of 20x20 cm and mulched immediately. The beds are covered with  an overhead pandal and are watered regularly. Recently, instead of raising  secondary nursery beds, the seedlings are also raised in poly bags containing  rich forest soil. Manuring at the rate of 90g N, 60g P2O5  and 120g K2O per bed of 5x1 size , in three equal split doses at an  interval of 45 days is recommended to produce healthier seedlings. The first  dose of fertilizer may be applied 30 days after transplanting in the secondary  nursery. In Karnataka, ten month old seedlings are used for planting in the  main yield, while in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, 18 months old seedlings are  commonly used.<br />
  <strong>Preparation of land</strong><br />
                  All under growth should be cleared and excess shade trees or  branches should be thinned out to have an even overhead canopy. Pits of  45x45x30 cm size are dug in April – May and filled with a mixture of top soil  and compost are well-decomposed farm yard manure. In sloppy land, contour  terraces may be made and pits may be taken along the contour and a close  planting (2mx2m) is advisable along the contour. The spacing adopted in  Karnataka for the Malabar type is 2x2 m o between plants and rows. In Kerala  region 2-3 m on either side is adopted. Staggered trenches may be taken across  the slope to conserve run off rainwater. The soil collected in trenches may be  utilized for earthing up during the post   monsoon period.<br />
  <strong>Planting</strong> <br />
  <img src="lec04_clip_image012.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" hspace="12" align="left" />       The  planting is carried out during the rainy season commencing from June. Under  Eastern Ghats hills July planting is adopted. Seedlings are to be adopted.  Seedlings are to be planted up to the collar region for better growth. Cloudy  days with light drizzle are ideal for planting. In some parts of tea estates in  South India, redgum (Eucalyptus sp) is planted in flat valley bottom at a  regular spacing. Cardamom under planted in this redgum areas produce better  growth as equal to natural jungle areas. Recently, mixed cropping of cardamom  in Arecanut, rubber and coffee plantations is gaining an impetus especially  with small growers which assure greater significance in the light of frequent  dry spells and fluctuating price structure.<br />
  <strong>Mulching</strong><br />
                  It is an important  cultural practice in cardamom. Fallen leaves of the shade trees are utilized  for mulching. Sufficient mulch should be applied during November – December to  reduce the ill effects of drought, which prevails for nearly 4 to 5 months  during summer. Exposing the panicle above the mulch is beneficial for the  pollination by bees.<br />
  <strong>Weeding</strong><br />
                  Depending upon the  intensity on weeds, 2-3 weedings are necessary in a year. The first round of  weeding is to be carried in May – June, the second in August – September and  the third in December – January. In sloppy land slashing of weeds is alone to  be carried out otherwise it encourages to more soil erosion. Weedicides like  paraquat @ 625 ml in 500 liters of water may be sprayed in the interspaces  between rows leaving 60 cm around the plant base.<br />
  <strong>Trashing</strong><br />
                  Trashing consists of  removing old and drying shoots of the plant once in a year with the onset of  monsoon under rainfed conditions and 2-3 times in high density plantations  provided with irrigation facilities.<br />
  <strong>Shade regulation</strong><br />
                  Cardamom being a pseophyte is very  sensitive to moisture stress. Shade helps to regulate soil moisture as well as  temperature and provides congenial microclimate for cardamom. Excess shade is  also detrimental and shade has to be regulated so as to provide 50-60% filtered  sunlight. Cardamom plants can tolerate less shade in areas where well  distributed and adequate rainfall is received. In South India many trees are  available in the natural habitat to provide shade but an ideal shade tree  should have a wide canopy, minimum side branching and it should not shed the  leaves during the flowering phase of cardamom so as not to affect pollination.  Some of the common shade trees in cardamom estates are Palangi (<em>Atrocarpus fraxinifolius</em>), Jack, Red cedar (<em>Cedrella tuna</em>), Karimaram (<em>Diospyros  ebenum</em>) and Elangi (<em>Mimusops elangi</em>).  The temporary shade trees like Erythina lithosperma and E. indica are the most  unsuitable as they compete for nutrients and soil moisture.<br />
                  In order to provide  adequate light during monsoon, shade regulation may be taken up before the  onset of monsoon. A two tier canopy with a height of not more than 3 m below  the lower and higher canopy may be maintained. Areas exposed to western side  should have adequate shade.<br />
  <strong>Earthing up</strong><br />
                  After the monsoon is  over, a thin layer of fresh fertile soil, rich in organic matter may be earthed  up at the base of the clump, covering up to the collar region by scrapping  between the rows or collecting soil from staggered trenches/check pits. This  encourages new growth.<br />
  <strong>Irrigation</strong> <br />
                  In order to overcome  the dry spell during summer, it is necessary to irrigate the crop to get  maximum production as it helps in initiation of panicles, flowering and fruit  set. Depending on the moisture holding capacity of soil and topography of the  soil and topography of the estates, they may be irrigated at an interval of 10  to 15 days till the onset of monsoon. Sprinkler irrigation and or drip  irrigation at the rate of 4 litres per clump per day during dry month&rsquo;s  increases the yield.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting and Processing</strong><br />
  <strong>       </strong>Cardamom plants normally start bearing two years after planting.  In most of the areas the peak period of harvest is during October- November.  Picking is carried out at an interval of 15-25 days. Ripe capsules are  harvested in order to get maximum green colour during curing.</p>

                <p>       After harvest,  capsules are dried either in fuel kiln or in electrical drier or in the sun. It  has been found that soaking the freshly harvested green cardamom capsules in  2%washing soda for 10 minutes prior to drying helps to retain the green colour  during drying. When drier is used, it should be dried at 45 to 500C  for 14 to 18 hours, while for kiln, over night drying at 50 to 600C  is required. The capsule kept for drying are spread thinly and stirred  frequently to ensure uniform drying. The dried capsules are rubbed with hands  or coir mat or wire mesh and winnowed to remove any foreign matter. They are  then sorted out according to size and colour, and stored in black polythene bag  to retain the green colour during storage. These bags are then kept in wooden  chambers.<br />
