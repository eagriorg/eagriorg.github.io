(<em>Plantago ovata </em>Forsk., Plantaginaceae)</p>
                <p><img src="lec33_clip_image002.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="298" hspace="12" align="left" /><img src="lec33_clip_image004.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="238" hspace="12" align="left" />             Isubgol or Psyllium (<em>Plantago ovata</em>)is  important for its seed and husk       which  have been used in-the indigenous medicine for many countries. II has the  property of absorbing and retaining water (40-90%) and therefore it works as an  anti-diarrhoea drug. It is beneficial in chronic dysenteries of amoebic and bacillary origin. The seed has  also Cooling and demulcent effect and is used in Ayurvedic, Unani and  Allopathic medicines. The husk yields a colloidal mucilage consisting mainly pf  xylose, arabinose and galacturonic acid. In India it is grown in about 16,000  to 20,000 hectare in North Gujarat and it is also recently cultivated in small  areas in Rajasthan, Haryana and Bihar. The husk and peel are exported largely  to USA, West Germany, the UK and France, fetching a foreign exchange of more  than crores annually. <br />
                  It is a stemless annual herb often attaining a  height of 30 to 40 cm, wit rosette leaves. The plant bears erect ovoid or  cylindrical spike with minute white flowers about 45-68, protogynous. Fruit is  capsule, each seed is encased in a  thin, White, translucent membrane, the husk, which is odourless and tastless. <br />
  <strong>Climate and Soil </strong><br />
                  It  requires cool and dry weather and hence in India, the crop is grown in winter  i.e. from November - December to March - April. Humid weather, at maturity  results in shattering of seeds. A light well drained sandy loam to rich loamy  soil with a pH of 7 -8 is ideal. <br />
  <strong>Varieties </strong><br />
                  Gujarat  Agricultural University has released two improved varieties viz. Gujarat  Isabgol-1 and Isabgol - 2 which have a yield potential of 800 - 900kg and 1000  kg/ha. respectively. <br />
  <strong>Preparation of land </strong><br />
                  Field must be free of weeds and clods and  should have fine tilth for good germination. The land is laid into flat beds of  convenient size i.e. 1.0m x 3.0 m or 2.5 m or 2.5 m.<br />
  <strong>Sowing </strong><br />
                  Fresh  seeds from the preceding crop season should be sown for getting high percent  germination. The seed rate varies from 4 - 6 kg and is sown after pretreatment  with thiram @ 3 g/kg of seed to protect the seedlings from the possible damage  of damping off. The seeds, being small and light are mixed with sufficient  quantity of fine sand before sowing. The seeds are sown broadcast and are swept  lightly with a broom in one direction to cover them with some soil. <br />
  <strong>After cultivation </strong><br />
                  Timely  weeding is important to encourage good growth of the plants. After 20-25 days  of sowing, first weeding is done and 2-3 weedings are required within 2 months of sowing. It responds to manuring. 25 Kg N/ha and 25 Kg P/ha are applied as  basal dose at the last ploughing and another dose of 25 Kg N/ha is top dressed  30 days after sowing. <br />
                  Immediately  after sowing light irrigation is essential. First irrigation should be given  with light flow of water. The seeds normally germinate in 6 -7 days. If the  germination is poor, second irrigation may be given. Later on irrigations are given as and when necessary.  Last irrigation should be given at the time when maximum number of spikes has  reached the milk stage. <br />
  <strong>Harvesting and processing </strong><br />
  <img src="lec33_clip_image006.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="168" hspace="12" align="left" />             The crop will be ready in about 110-130 days  after sowing. When mature, the crop turns yellowish and the spike turns  brownish. The seeds shed when the spikes are pressed even slightly. At the time  of harvest the atmosphere must be dry and there should not be any moisture on  the plant. <br />
                  The plants are normally cut at the  ground level or uprooted if the soil is loose textured. The harvested plants  are threshed and winnowed, and the seeds repeatedly sifted until clean. The seeds may be marketed whole or the husk may be sold  separately. Seeds are fed to a series of shellers; in each sheller the grinding  pressure is so adjusted to remove only the husk. This is  separated by fans and sieves at each sheller and the ungrounded material is  sent to the next sheller. The husk: seed ratio is 25:75 by weight. <br />
                  The average yield is about one tonne of seeds per  hectare.</p>

<br />
                <p>Downy  mildew caused by <em>Peronospora plantaginia  is</em> the serious disease at the tiine of  spike initiation. Spraying of copper oxy chloride or Dithane Z.78 @ 2.0 g/litre of water  is recommended as a prophylactive measure on 30th day from sowing and repeated  twice, at an interval of 15 – 20 days. </p>
