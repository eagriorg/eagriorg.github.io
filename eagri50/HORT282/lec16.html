				<p align="center"><strong>BETEL  VINE</strong><br />
				  <em>(Piper betle, </em>Piperaceae)</p>
                <p><img src="lec16_clip_image002.jpg" alt="" width="254" height="340" hspace="12" align="left" /> Betel (<em>Piper betle Linn.)</em> leaf is used as a masticatory along with  arecanut, lime and catechu. The  probable places of origin of betel vine are India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and  Indonesia.  In India it is an important  commercial crop of Andhra Pradesh, occupying about 3,600 hectares. The vine is  a dioecious (male and female plants are different), shade loving perennial root  climber. <br />
                  <strong>Botany</strong></p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Woody       climber with adventitious roots at swollen nodes. </li>
                  <li>Leaf       simple, alternate, cordate, 8-12 cm wide, 12-16 cm long, with Description       odor and spicy taste. </li>
                  <li>Inflorescence       in axillary spike; flowers unisexual, white. </li>
                  <li>Fruit       globose berry. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Climate  and Soil </strong><br />
                  Betel  vine requires a tropical climate with high atmospheric humidity. It can be  cultivated in the uplands as well as in wetlands. In Kerala, it is mainly  cultivated in arecanut and coconut gardens as an intercrop. The crop grows best  on well-drained fertile soils. Waterlogged, saline and alkali soils are  unsuitable for its cultivation. The crop also comes up very well in lateritic  soils. Proper shade and irrigation are essential for successful cultivation of  this crop. An annual rainfall ranging from 200 to 450 cm is ideal. The crop  tolerates a minimum temperature of 10ºC and a maximum of 40ºC. Extremely low  atmospheric temperature leads to leaf fall. Hot dry winds are harmful.<br />
  <a name="variety" id="variety"><strong>Varieties</strong></a><strong> </strong><br />
                  There  are about 100 varieties of betel vine in the world, of which about 40 are found  in India and 30 in West Bengal. There are mainly five cultivars of betelvine <em>viz.</em> Desawari,  Bangla, Kapoori, Meetha and Sanchi. While Kapoori  and Sanchi are the principal cultivars in the peninsular India, Bangla and Deswari are common in North India. Cv. Meetha is grown on commercial scale in West Bengal  only. Betelvine is cultivated over an area of 40,000  ha in the country. It is a capital and labour intensive cash crop. <br />
                  The  important types grown in Tamil Nadu are Thulasi, Venmani, Arikodi, Kalkodi,  Karilanchi, Karpuram, Chelanthikarpuram, Koottakkodinandan, Perumkodi,  Amaravila and Pramuttan,  Kallarkodi, Revesi, Karpuri, SGM 1, Vellaikodi, Pachaikodi, Sirugamani 1,  Anthiyur kodi, Kanyur kodi. </p>

                <p><strong>Season</strong><br />
                  November - December and  January – February are optimum for cultivation.<br />
  <strong>Preparation of field</strong><br />
                  The  field is prepared to a fine tilth and beds of 2 m wide are formed to a  convenient length. Provide drainage trenches of 0.5 m width by 0.5 m depth in  between two adjoining beds. Plant the seeds of the live supports i.e. Agathi (<em>Sesbania  grandiflora</em>) in long rows. About 750 banana suckers are planted at the  edges of the beds, which are used, for tying the vines on the live support and  for packing the betel leaf.&nbsp; When the Agathi plants reach 4 m height, they  are topped off for maintaining the height. The crop is planted in two rows in  beds of 180 cm width on Agathi plants with a spacing of 45 cm between plants in  the row.<br />
  <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
                  Irrigate the field immediately  after planting and afterwards once in a week.<br />
  <strong>After cultivation</strong><br />
  <strong>Training of the live standards</strong><br />
                  Before  the establishment of vines, the side branches of Agathi trees up to a height of  2 m are removed for early creeping of the vines.<br />
  <strong>Trailing of the vines</strong><br />
                  The  cuttings sprout and creep in about a month. At this time, they must be trailed  on the standards. Training is done by fixing the vine at intervals of 15 to 20  cm along the live standards loosely with the help of banana fibre. Training is  done at every 15 - 20 days interval depending upon the growth of vines.<br />
                  Instead  of live standards sometimes bamboo standards are erected at intervals and  linked by tying at heights of 30 cm and 150 cm using coir rope. In the initial  stages trailing is done on coir tied for the purpose. Trailing is done further  by tying the vines, at intervals of 15-20 cm along the standards loosely with  the help of banana fibre. <br />
                  When  vines come in contact with standards, they produce adventitious roots using  which they cling to support. Trailing is done every 15-20 days depending on the  growth of vines.<br />

                <p>  <strong>Bamboo standard                        </strong><strong>Live standard</strong>                </p>
                <p><strong>Lowering of vines</strong><br />
                  Under  normal cultivation, the vines grow to height of 3 m in one year period. When  they reach this height their vigour to produce normal size leaf are reduced and  they need rejuvenation by lowering during March - April. After the vine is  lowered, the tillers spring up from the nodes at the bends of the coiled vines  at the ground level and produce many primary vines. Irrigation should be given  after each lowering.<br />
  <strong>Manuring</strong><br />
                Apply 150 kg N/ha/year through  Neem cake (75 kg N) and Urea (75 kg N) and 100 kg P2O5 through Super phosphate  and 30 kg Muriate of potash in three split doses first at 15 days after lifting  the vines and second and third dose at 40 - 45 days intervals.&nbsp; Apply on  beds shade dried neem leaf or C<em>alotropis</em> leaves at 2 t/ha and cover it  with mud (2 t in 2 split doses).</p>

                  <strong>Scale insects</strong><br />
                  Select  scale-free seed vines. Spray Chlorpyriphos 20 EC 2 ml/lit when one or two  scales are noticed on the basal portion of the stem/leaves. Direct the spray  solution to the basal portion of the vines.&nbsp; Spray NSKE 5 % or Malathion  50 EC 1 ml/lit.<br />
  <strong>Mites </strong><br />
                  Mites  can be controlled by spraying Wettable sulphur 50 WP @ 1 g/lit or Dicofol 18.5  EC 0.5 ml/lit.<br />
  <strong>Sooty mould (Aphids)</strong><br />
                  To  control aphids spray Chlorpyriphos at 2 ml/lit on Agathi leaves. Clip off  excess Agathi leaves.<br />
  <strong>Mealy bugs</strong><br />
                  Mealy  bugs can be controlled by spraying Chlorpyriphos 20 EC at 2 ml/lit or  Dimethoate 30 EC 2ml/lit. Concentrate the spray towards the collar region.<br />
  <strong>Nematode</strong><br />
                  Application of Neem cake at 1 t/ha or shade dried <em>Calotropis</em> leaves @  2.5&nbsp;t/ha can be applied to soil for controlling the nematode populations. <br />

                <p><strong>Bacterial leaf spot, blight and  bacterial stem rot</strong><br />
                  Spray  Streptocyclin @ 400 ppm + Bordeaux mixture @ 0.25% at the time of first disease  symptoms appear. Continue spraying at 20 days intervals.&nbsp; Always spray the  chemical after plucking the leaves.<br />
  <strong>Anthracnose </strong><br />
                  Spray  0.5% Bordeaux mixture after plucking the leaves after the first appearance of  the symptom. The variety Karpoori is susceptible to the disease.<br />
  <strong>Powdery mildew</strong><br />
                  Powdery  mildew can be controlled by spraying 0.2% Wettable sulphur after plucking the  leaves.<br />
  <strong>Harvest</strong><br />
                  &nbsp;In about 3-6 months  time, vines grow to a height 150-180 cm. At this stage branching is noticed in  the vines. Leaves are removed along with the petiole with the right thumb. Once  harvesting is commenced, it is continued almost every day or week. The interval  of harvesting varies from 15 days to about a month till the next lowering of  vines. After each harvest, manuring has to be done.<br />
  <strong> Yield</strong><br />
                  About 75 to 100 lakh  leaves/ha/year can be obtained.<br />
