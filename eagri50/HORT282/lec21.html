				  (Dioscorea <em>sp., </em>Dioscoreaceae)</p>
                <p> Diosgenin,  obtained from Dioscorea tubers, is the major base chemical for several steroid  hormones including sex hormones, cortisone, and other corticosteroids and is  the active ingredient in the oral contraceptive pill. The growing need for  steroidal drugs and the high cost of obtaining them from animal sources led to  a widespread search for plant sources of steroidal sapogenins; which ultimately  led to the identification of the genus <em>Dioscorea </em>as the most promising one. <br />
                  This genus <em>Dioscorea </em>belonging to family  Dioscoreaceae with over 600 species is widely distributed in tropical world.  Some of the species like <em>D</em>.­<em>alata </em>and <em>D.esculenta </em>are under  cultivation for long time for their edible tubers. There are about 15 species  of this genus containing diosgenin. Among this, <em>D.floribunda,  D.villosa,</em> <em>D.composita etc. </em>are widely grown for dios­genin  production.  </p>

                <p>            The major Dioscorea producing  countries are Mexico, Guatamala, Costa Rica, India and China. The estimated  world consumption of dios­genin is somewhere between 800 to 1000 tonnes per  year. India produces only 25 tonnes of diosgenin annually mainly from the  natural source and to be self sufficient, India has to step up its production  to the tune of about 200 tonnes of Diosgenin per year. The cultivation hints  for <em>D. floribunda is </em>dicussed here.<br />
                  The best adapted species in Kamataka, Assam,  Meghalaya, Tamil Nadu, Goa, &amp; Andaman is <em>D.floribunda, </em>an  introudction from Mexico. It produces  compact tubers at a shallow depth. The diosgenin content varies from 2 to 7 per  cent depending on the age of the tubers. </p>

                </strong>
                <p><strong>Climate and</strong><strong> </strong><strong>soil </strong><br />
                  It is a  tropical species preferring a tropical climate without extremity in  temperature. It is adapted to moderate  to heavy rainfall areas. Dioscorea plants can be grown in a wide variety of  soils, but light soil is good as harvesting of tubers is easier in such soils.  Extremely heavy clay soils are, in general not recommended, as they restrict  tuber growth and make harvesting difficult. Dioscorea tolerates fairly wide  variation in soil pH, though very acid soils should be avoided, the ideal soil  pH being 5.5 to 6.5.<br />
  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
                  The Indian Institute of  Horticultural Research, Bangalore has released so far two improved varieties. <br />
  <strong>1. FB(c)-l:</strong> This  is a composite strain of <em>D. floribunda, </em>which has been released for  commercial cultivation. This is a vigorous growing strain relatively free from  diseases: This has a diosgenin content of 3 to 3.5 per cent. It is suitable for cultivation around  Bangalore and Coorg (Karnataka), Goa, Assam, Maghalaya, Tamilnadu, Maharashtra  and Andaman. <br />
  <strong>2.  Arka Upkar:</strong> This is a high yielding clone released  recently. The plants are very vigorous with a stout, robust vine, bearing broad  dark green leaves: The tuber branches are thick, broad and deep. It has a higher diosgenin content of 3.5 to  4.0 per cent. <br />
  <strong>Propagation </strong><br />
  <em>            Dioscorea floribunda </em>can  be propagated by tuber pieces, single node stem cuttings or seed. Commercial  planting is normally established by tuber pieces only. Propagation through seed  progeny is variable and it may take longer time to obtain tuber yields. <br />
                  Propagation from tuber pieces is  accomplished by cutting the tubers into pieces weighing about 50-70 g each.  Three types of tuber pieces can be distinguished for propagation purpose. <em>viz</em> (1) Crown, (2) Median and (3) Tip. Crowns produce new shoots within 30 days  after planting, since they have preformed buds. Medians and tips may take up to  100 days to sprout. Crowns are therefore preferred for commercial planting.  However, if there is a shortage of material, median and tip portions can be  used for planting. Dipping of tuber pieces for 5 minutes in 0.3% solution of  Benlate followed by dusting the cut ends with 0.3% Benlate in talcum powder  before planting or storage in moist sand beds effectively checks the tuber rot.  This treatment is very essential for obtaining uniform stand of the crop. The  best time for planting is by the end of April so that the new sprouts will grow  vigorously during the rainy season commencing in June in India. <br />
                  For rapid multiplication of the  elite materials in the initial stages, single leaf node cuttings can be  adopted. The cutting consists of a single leaf with petiole and about 0.8 cm of  the stem. Such cuttings are prepared from non-flowering plants. They are pre  treated with 500ppm of IBA solution by quick dipping and are planted in the  mist chamber in sand beds. Within 8-10 weeks, these cuttings are transferred to  plastic bags containing equal mixtures of sand, soil and farm yard manure. They  will be ready for transplanting in the main field in six months time. This  method is not recommended for commercial planting as the growth is very slow  but useful to initially multiply the elite materials in larger number. <br />
                  For raising a crop from seed, fresh  seed should be sown in 8 cm x 12 cm plastic bags in the month of February.  Polythene bags may be filled up with a pot mixture containing equal parts of  sand, soil and farm yard manure. Vermiculite should be used on the top. Atleast  two well filled seeds may be sown in each plastic bag at a depth of 0.5 to 1.0  cm. The nursery may be protected from drying by light shade. The bags may be  watered with care, lightly and frequently. The germination process  completes within four weeks. The seedlings being a vine, it should be supported  promptly with thin twigs. <br />
                  The best  season for transplanting the/seedlings in the fields is June-July. Vigorous  seedlings may be alone transplanted and others may be discarded. The bottom and  sides of bag may be cut before transplanting so as to transplant the seedlings  without disturbing the root system. As the progenies raised from seeds are  highly variable and their growth is slow, this method is not recommended for  commercial plantations.<br />
  <strong>Planting</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Land should be prepared thoroughly till a fine tilth is  obtained. Deep furrows should be made at 60 cm distance with plough. The stored  tuber pieces are ready for planting, seedlings or single node stem cuttings  should be planted in furrows with 30 cm between the plants for one year crop  and 45 cm for two year crop. The tuber pieces are planted at about 0.5 cm below  the soil level. The new sprouts should be staked immediately. After sprouting  is complete, the plants could be earthed up. Soil from the ridges may be used  for earthing up so that the original furrows will become ridges and vice verse.<br />
  <strong>After care </strong><br />
                  Dioscorea  vines need support for their optimum growth and hence the vines are trained  over pandal system or trellis. <br />
  <strong>Weeding</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Initially, the vines are weak and tender and can not  compete efficiently with the surrounding weeds. Periodic hand weeding, as and  when necessary, is essential for the first few months. Experience has shown  that once the plants have climbed up on the pandal, the weed populations  considerably reduced due to shading. The plants by this stage can also compete  more successfully with weeds.<br />
                  <strong>Manures and Fertilizers</strong><br />
  <em>             D.floribunda </em>requires high organic matter for good tuber formation.  Besides a basal dose of 18 to 20 tonnes of per ha, a complete fertilizer dose  of 300 Kg nitrogen, 150 Kg phosphorous and 150 Kg of potassium should be  applied per hectare. Phosphorous and potassium should be applied in two equal  doses one after the establishment of the crop during May-June and the other  during vigorous growth period of the crop (August- September).         <br />
  <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Irrigation may be given at weekly intervals  in the initial stage and afterwards at about 10 day’s interval. However during  rainy season no ~irrigation is needed. In Anamalais, it is raised under pure rainfed conditions. <br />
  <strong>Interopping</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Intercropping with legumes like cowpea,  horse gram, duster bean and French bean has been found to smother weeds and  also provide an extra income without adversely affecting' the tuber yield and diosgenin content. <br />
  <strong>Duration</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The diosgenin content tends to increase  with age (2.5 to 3:0 per cent during the first year and 3.0 to 3.5 percent in  the second year) and also the tuber yield and hence a two year crop is found to  be more economical. <br />
  <strong>Harvesting</strong><br />
                  The  tubers grow to about 25 to 30 cm depth and hence harvesting is done by manual  labour. The best season for harvesting is Feb- March, coinciding with the dry  period. On an average 50 to 60 tonnes of fresh tubers can be obtained from one  hectare in two years duration. <br />
  <strong>Plant Protection</strong><br />
                  The  major pests of Dioscorea are the aphids and Red spider mites. Aphids occur more  commonly on young seedlings and vines. They feed on the young leaves and stem. Young leaves and vine tips eventually die  if aphids are not controlled. Older growth is seldom affected. Red spider  mites attack the underside of the leaves at the base near the petiole. Severe  infestations result in necrotic areas, which are often attacked by fungi. Both  aphids and spider mites can be very easily controlled by 0.5 a.i. Kelthane. No serious disease is reported to infect this crop. </p>
