				  Senna is a small perennial under­  shrub, a native of Yemen, South Arabia. The leaves and pods contain Sennosides  used for their laxative properties. It was introduced into Tamil Nadu in the  eighteenth century where it is grown as an annual crop of 5 to 7 months  duration in 8 000 to 10 000 ha both under rainfed and irrigated conditions.  Successful cultivations have also been demonstrated in Karnataka (Bangalore)  Gujarat (Anand), Rajasthan (Jodhpur) and Delhi with comparable yield and  quality of the produce, but it is yet to establish itself as a cash crop there  due to the lack of organized marketing. A major part of the produce is exported  in the form of leaves, pods and sennoside concentrates, though several pharamaceutical  houses utilize it for the manufacture of calcium sennoside granules, tablets  and syrups for marketing within the country as well. Germany, Hungary, Japan,  Netherlands and the USA are the main markets. The export of leaves and pods  from India is of the value of Rs. 20 million annually. In addition, the  erstwhile USSR countries buy sennosides (concen­trates) and the current o'1nual  export of the sennoside concentrate is around Rs. 20 million.<br />
				  Senna is used in medicine as a  cathartic. It is especially useful in habitual constipation. It increases the  peristaltic movement of the colon. The pods have the tendency to gripe caused  by senna may be obtained by combining it with an aromatic or a saline laxative.  The laxative principles of senna are two glycosides, viz., sennoside A and  sennoside B. The plant also contains sennosides C &amp; D. A number of other  gIycocides have also been reported. It also contains beta-sterol (0.33%) and  flavanols-kaemferol, kaempferin and isorhamnetin. They are used in the form of  decoctions, powders; con­fections and many other household preparations. Senna  extracts, on storage, lose biological activity more rapidly than is revealed by  chemical estimation. The leaves/pods as such or in powder form do not lose  potency easily. The quantity administered in the form of infusion ranges from  0.6 to 2 g of leaves or pods soaked in 125 ml of warm water for about 12 hours,  whereas, it is usually 30 mg of sennosides per tablet.<br />
  <strong>Origin and  Distribution</strong><br />
  <em>            Cassia </em>is a pantropic  genus comprising of 500 species, of which 20 are found in the native flora of  India. There are two sources of the Senna drug, namely, <em>Cassia augustifolia </em>Vahl,  and C. <em>acutifolia. </em>Del. C. <em>angustifolia, </em>commonly called  Tirunelvely senna, is indigenous to Somalia, Southern Arabia, part of Sindh  (Pakistan) and the Kutch area of Gujarat. In India, it is cultivated in  Gujarat, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. In Tamil Nadu it is cultivated in the  districts of Thirunelveli, Ramanathapuram, Madurai, Salem and Tiruchirapalli in  an area of about 10000 hectares. C. <em>acutifolia </em>known as Alexandrian senna is indigenous to Sudan and Sinai.  It is cultivated on a small scale in Sudan and Egypt, and is mainly collected  from wild plants of C. <em>acutifolia, </em>whereas the Indian produce comes  entirely from the cultivated crop of C. <em>angustifolia </em>and their pods  contain about 2.4-4.5 and 1.25 to 2.5% sennosides, respectively.<br />
  <strong>Description of  the Plant</strong><br />
				  Cassia <em>angustifolia </em>(2n=28),  belonging to the family Leguminaesae, is a small perennial under shrub, below 1  m in height with ascending branches. The leaves are large, compound and  pinnate. The full­ grown leaflets are bluish-green to pale-green in colour and  emit a characteristic fetid smell when crushed. The flowers are bright yellow  in colour, arranged in axillary, (on subterminal) erect, many-flowered racemes.  The flowers are not season bound and are borne between, 35 to 70 days of age,  depending upon the time of sowing, and its season of cultivation. The pods  appear immediately after flowering, are slightly curved, 3.5 to 6.5 cm long and  up to 1.5 cm broad, green in the beginning changing to greenish-brown to dark  brown on maturity and drying. Each pod has 5 to 7 ovate, compressed, smooth,  dark-brown seeds.</p>

                <p>            The other species is very similar to  C. <em>angustifolia </em>in morphology and growth, except in the dimension of its  leaflets and pods. The leaflets are shorter and narrow. The pods are distinctly  short, flat and broad, oblong but slightly curved upwards and are broadly  rounded at the two ends. -Further, surface making on the testa (seed) and  stomatal index (leaves) are, remarkably, considered to distinguish between the  two species. It has been found that Cassia <em>obouata </em>and C. <em>italica </em>also  possess a fair to good percentage of anthraquinone compounds; C. <em>obouata </em>is  common all over India. C. <em>italica </em>grows on sandy, saline soils in west  Rajasthan and Saurashtra (Gujarat) and is a potential new source of the senna  drug.<br />
                  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
                  <strong>KKM-1:</strong> It is a  selection from Thenkalam local type. 135-140 days. It contains 2.34 %  sennoside. It is suitable for Thirunelveli and Tuticorin districts.<br />
                  The Gujarat Agriculture University,  under the All India Co-ordinated Project on Medicinal and Aromatic Plants at  Anand, has released a late flowering type as 'ALFf -2' through selection, which  remains in a vegetative stage till 100 days and is suitable for growing  exclusively as a leaf-crop. The CIMAP, Lucknow, has also released a  high-yielding variety named 'Sona'.<br />
  <strong>Soil</strong><br />
                  The crop can thrive on a variety of  soils, but is largely grown on red loam, alluvial loam and the rich clayey  rice-fields. The texture of the soils which account for the major hectrage  under senna crop varies from sandy loam to loam, while the black cotton soils  are heavier and more fertile. In general, these soils are more friable but less  moisture retentive and of low fertility, usually, nitrogen and phosphoric acid  are deficient throughout these soils. The average pH ranges from 7-8.5. It is  very sensitive to water-logging and, hence, it is grown only on well drained  soils.<br />
  <strong>Climate</strong><br />
                  Senna is a sun-loving crop and  requires bright sunshine for its successful growth. The trials at Bangalore  have shown that it can be grown as an early summer (Feb-March) or a winter  (Oct-Nov) crop. However, sowing in the rainy season is not good, as the crop on  harvest cannot be dried easily. Whereas, under North Indian condi­tions like  Delhi and Gujarat, where the rainy season is short, it is reported to be the  ideal time as the plants put on luxuriant growth. Heavy rains and cloudy  weather during growth are harmful to the crop. An average rainfall of 25-40 cm,  distributed from June to October is sufficient to yield good harvests.<strong></strong><br />
  <strong>Land Preparation</strong><br />
                  The land is prepared deep and  exposed to the sun for 110-115 days to dry out the roots of perennial weeds,  followed by two cross­ ploughings, harrowing and leveling. FYM is incorporated  into the soil at the time of the final cross-ploughing. Then the land is laid  out into plots of convenient sizes with irrigation channels.</p>
                <p><strong>Cultivation</strong><br />
                  <strong>Propagation</strong><br />
                  The crop is raised from seeds. Since  the seeds have a hard and tough seed-coat, a certain amount of abrading of its  surface is necessary to induce quick germination. This is achieved by pounding  the seeds lightly with coarse sand in a mortar.<br />
                  Soaking the seeds for 10-12 hours before sowing is reported not only to  give 100% germination, but also the stand of the plants grown is even. About 20  kg of seeds are required to cover a hectare of land.<br />
  <strong>Sowing</strong><br />
                  The seeds are broadcast or, more  preferably, drilled at a distance of 30 cm in lines made at 30 cm apart at 1.5  to 2.5 cm depth on well­ prepared land. The germination commences on the third  day and is completed within a fortnight. Before sowing, the field should be  perfectly levelled, lest it hamper uniform seed germination. It is found that  treating the seeds with Thiram, Captan or Agroson G.N. at 2.5 g/kg protects the  seedlings from damping-off and seedling blight diseases which are common  occurrences. The seeds can also be dibbled on the inner sides of the ridges  opened at 45 cm distance, maintaining a plant-to-plant spacing of 30 cm. Only  about 5 kg of seeds are required for this method of sowing.<br />
  <strong>Manures and  Fertilizers</strong><br />
                  Farmers in Tamil Nadu use 4-5  cartloads (5-10 t/ha) of well-rotted FYM at the time of sowing. In most cases,  it fully utilizes any leftover nutrient from the previous crop and, therefore,  the nutrient require­ment of senna is variable. However, trials in India have  shown that the crop in all, takes 50-100 kg of N, 20-50 kg of P and about 30 kg  of K /ha in a growing period of 130-150 days, depending upon the growth and  number of pickings. In general, where specific soil nutrient status of the  field is not readily found, 80 kg of N and 40 kg each of P and K/ha may be  applied for the optimum production of leaf, pod and total alkaloids. Of these,  the entire dose of P and K and 50% of N should be applied at the time of  sowing, and the remaining 50% of N is to be applied 90 days after sowing. <strong></strong><br />
  <strong>Crop Rotation and  Inter cropping </strong><br />
                  In Tamil Nadu, senna is grown after  the paddy and intercrop cultiva­tion in between rows of cotton, sesamum,  chillies, brinjal, okra and tomatoes is popular. Studies conducted at Delhi  showed that senna­-mustard and senna-coriander rotations gave higher profits and  these rotations have proved superior.                </p>
                <p><strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
                  Senna can be economically grown  under rainfed conditions. In most years, the crop needs no irrigations except  during prolonged drought. However, when it is grown as a semi irrigated crop  the yield, increases considerably. About, 5-8 light irrigations are enough to  raise a good crop of senna as heavy irrigations are injurious to the crop.<br />
  <strong>Weeding and  Interculture</strong><br />
                  When the plants begin to grow, once  or twice inter culturing is given after which the rows close up. The first  weeding-cum-hoeing is done at 25-30 days, a second at 75-80 days and a third at  110 days, to keep the soil free from weeds. The use of Teeflan herbicide as a  pre-emergent sprays at the rate of 4 kg/ha has been reported not only to increase  the yield, but also the anthraquinone content.<br />
  <strong>Pests and  Diseases</strong><br />
  <strong>Pests </strong><br />
                  The larvae of several leaf-eating  caterpillars feed on the green senna leaves. Usually, the spraying of Carbaryl  (4 g/I) periodically in the growing season controls the infestation. The white  butterfly <em>(Catopsilia pyranthae) </em>attack on this crop can be minimized by  sowing the crop in March-April, instead of June-July in North India.<br />
                  Another pest, a pod borer is also reported to attack the pods and can be  controlled by spraying Endosulphan (0.05%) or Carbaryl (0.25%) at an interval  of 10-15 days.<br />
  <strong>Diseases</strong><br />
                  The leaf-spot disease is the most  serious disease and causes severe damage to the crop. The infested leaves drop  off, resulting in poor yield. The disease is caused by <em>Alternaria alternata  (Fr.) </em>Keisel. <em>Phyllosticta </em>spp. and <em>Cercospora </em>spp. The  sennoside content in the leaves is inversely proportional to the intensity of  the disease. The spraying of 0.15% Dithane M-45 at fortnight intervals, 3 times  in a period of 5-6 weeks, has been found to control the disease effectively.<br />
                  Damping-off of seedlings is the most  devastating disease, which is caused by <em>Rhizoctonia bataticola. </em>The  disease spreads rapidly if the fields are affected by stagnating moisture at  this stage. Treatment with Thiram or Captan at 2.5 g/kg of seeds protects the  growing seedlings. At a later stage its other physiological form, called <em>Macrophomina  phaseoli </em>develops; it causes dry rot in the crop and kills the plant. The  fields can be drenched with 0.2% Brassicol or 0.5 to 01. %. Rhizoctol, but this  only gives partial control.<br />
                  The leaf-blight disease is caused by <em>Phyllosticta </em>spp. usually occur­ring at the later stages of growth, in  September-October. Cloudy days and humid weather conditions favour the spread  of the disease.<br />
  <img width="328" height="204" src="lec32_clip_image009.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="DCP_2848" />            The leaf-spot disease initially  appears as small, brown, irregularly scattered lesions on leaves which grow  bigger in size and turn black in colour at a later stage. The praying of 0.15%  Diahane M-45 at fortnightly intervals can control the diseases.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting,  Processing and Storage</strong><br />
                  It has been found that young senna  leaves and pods contain a high sennoside content but since the produce is sold  on the basis of weight, a balance between weight and content has to be made, to  choose the right stage for harvest. It is also found that senna plants produce  foliage containing higher sennosides between 50-90 days of sowing. The first  picking of the foliage crop should be done at 50-70 days' age, depending upon  the total plant growth. The picking of leaves is done by hand so that most of  the growing tops are removed at harvest; this also induces more branching  which, other­wise, reduces the foliage growth considerably. A second picking is  taken at 90-100 days and the third picking between 130-150 days, when the  entire plants are removed, so that the harvested material includes both leaves  and pods together.<br />
                  The harvested crop should be spread  in a thin layer in an open field to reduce its moisture. Further drying of the  produce is done in well-ventilated drying sheds. It takes 10-12 days to dry  completely. The dry leaves and pods should have a light-green to  greenish-yellow colour. Improper and delayed drying changes the colour to black  or brown which lowers the sennoside content and it fetches a lower price. A  rapid mechanical drying at 40°C could also be attempted. The seeds contain no  sennosides and only add weight to the produce. The pods are threshed during  drying to remove the seeds. The pro­duce is baled under hydraulic pressure and  wrapped in gunny bags for export.<br />
  <strong>Yield</strong><br />
                A good crop of senna can give 15  q/ha of dry leaves and 7 q/ha of pods, under irrigated and good management  conditions. The yield, under rainfed conditions is about 10 q/ha of leaves and  4 q/ha of pods.</p>

                <p><strong>Estimation of Sennosides</strong><br />
                  To 0.5 g (40 mesh) of accurately  weighed powder in a 100 ml flask add 50 ml of water, swirl to mix, attach a  reflux condenser and, immerse the flask in a boiling water-bath with the  water-level in the bath just above that of the liquid in the flask, for 15  minutes. Allow the mixture to cool. Decant and filter the extract into a  volumetric flask (100 ml). Add 50 ml water to the residue and extract again in  the boiling water-bath as above. The final volume in the flask is made up to  100 ml.<br />
                  Transfer 20 ml of the clear,  supernatant liquid from the volumetric flask to a separating funnel, add 0.05  ml of hydrochloric acid and extract with two successive 15 ml portions of  chloroform. Discard the chloroform extracts.<br />
                  Transfer 20 ml of aqueous extract  from the separating funnel to a 100 ml flask. Adjust the pH to 7-8 (with pH  paper) with 5% w/v solution of sodium carbonate in water. Add 20 ml of 6.3% w/v  freshly-prepared solution of ferric chloride (FeCI3) in a water-mix, attach a  reflux condenser to the flask and heat on a boiling water­ bath for 20 minutes  and without cooling the liquid, add 2 ml of HCI. Continue the heating for a  further 20 minutes, swirling the liquid in the flask frequently, to dissolve  the precipitate and allow it to cool.<br />
                Transfer the liquid into a  separating funnel, extract with three 25 ml portions of solvent ether, having  used each portion to rinse the flask first. Wash the combined etherel extracts  with two 15 ml portions of water and dilute to 100 ml with solvent ether.  Evaporate 10 ml (extract) of the etherel solution to just-dryness on a  water-bath and dissolve the residue in 10 ml of IN KOH. Then, immediately  measure the extinction of 1 cm layer to 500 mm using water as a blank.</p>
