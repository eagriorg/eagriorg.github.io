				<p align="center"><strong>ARECANUT</strong><br />
			    <strong><em>(Areca  catechu,</em></strong><strong> Palmae)</strong></p>
				<p align="center">Arecanut palm is cultivated primarily for  its kernel obtained from the fruit which is chewed in its tender, ripe or  processed form. Though it is native of Malayan Archipelago, Philippines and  other East Indian Islands, Commercial cultivation is confined only in India,  Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. India has about 2, 00,000 ha under this crop with an  annual production of 2, 28, 600 tonnes. Kerala, Karnataka and Assam account for  more than 90 per cent of the total area and production in our country.<br />
				  Arecanut production in India has now  almost reached a level of self sufficiency. Uses for arecanut other than  chewing are negligible. Its export    prospects are also very much limited. Therefore, the present policy is  not to expand the area under arecanut, but to adopt intensive cultivation and  take up replanting of the aged and unproductive gardens. Inter and mixed  cropping in arecanut gardens is advocated to augment the income from the  existing arecanut garden.<br />
  <strong>Botany</strong> <br />
				  It is a monoecious palm and its  inflorescence is a spadix produced in the leaf axil and is completely enclosed  in a sealed boat shaped spathe. The spadix is having a main rachis divided  subsequently into secondary and tertiary rachis. Female flowers are confined to  tertiary and distal end of the secondary rachis, while male flowers are  produced on filiform branches arising below and beyond the female flowers. Both  female and male flowers are sessile, with two whorls of perianth. The fruit is  a monolocular, one seeded berry and it consists of a fibrous outer husk,  enclosing a single seed. It is a cross pollinated crop and fruit set normally  varies form 12.0 to 40.0 percent and the time taken from full bloom to maturity  of the fruit ranges from 35 to 47 weeks.<br />
  <strong>Climate  and Soil</strong> <br />
				  The arecanut palm is capable of growing  under a variety of climatic and soil conditions. It grows well from almost sea  level   up to an altitude of 1000 metres  in areas receiving abundant and well distributed rainfall or under irrigated  conditions. It is grown in soils such as laterite, red loam and alluvial soils.  The soil should be deep and well drained.<br />
  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
				  There are few local varieties known by  the name of the place where they are grown and are Thirthahalli, South Kanara,  Mettupalayam, Mohitnagar. Regional Station, Vittal has released three improved  cultivars, they are,<br />
  <strong>Mangala:</strong> An  introduction from China early bearing, higher fruit set, higher yield, semi  tall variety.<br />
  <strong>Subamangala</strong>: A selection from Indonesia, yield  17.5 kg of nuts/palm at the age of 10 years.<br />
  <strong>Sreemangala:</strong> A selection from Singapore yields  16.5 kg/palm at the 10th year.<br />
  <strong>SAS-1</strong>: Sirsi Arecanut Slection, resealed  from UAS, Dharwad.<br />
  <strong>Raising of planting materials</strong><br />
  <img src="lec15_clip_image002.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="249" hspace="12" align="left" />Collection  of seed nuts should be confined to high yielding palms which commence to bear  early as well as those which give more than 50 % of fruit set. From these  selected mother palms, fully ripe nuts are alone collected. All undersized and  malformed nuts must be rejected. Heavier seed nuts within a bunch are alone selected,  as they give higher percentage of germination and produce seedlings of better  vigour than lighter ones.<br />
  <img src="lec15_clip_image004.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="177" hspace="12" align="left" />       The selected seed nuts are sown  immediately after harvest, 5cm apart in sand beds under partial shade with  their stalk ends pointing upwards. Sand is spread over the nuts just to cover  them. The beds may be watered daily. Germination commences in about 40 days  after sowing and the sprouts can be transplanted to the second nursery when  they are about three months old. At this stage the sprouts might have produced  two to three leaves.<br />
				  The secondary nursery beds of 150 cm  width and of convenient length are prepared for transplanting the sprouts. The  sprouts are transplanted at a spacing of 30X30 cm with the onset of monsoon.  Partial shade to the seedlings can also be provided during summer by pandal or  growing banana. Care should be taken to drain the nursery beds during the  monsoon and to irrigate them during the dry months. Weeding and mulching should  be done periodically. Seed nuts can also be sown in polythene bags (25 X 15 cm  size ,150 gauge) after filling the bags with potting mixture containing 7 parts  of loam or top soil, 3 parts of dried and powdered farm yard manure and 2 parts  of sand.<br />
				  The seedlings will be ready for  transplanting to the main field when they are 12 to 18 months old. Seedlings  having 5 or more number of leaves selected. The height of seedlings at the time  of planting has a negative correlation with the subsequent yield of the plant.  Hence shorter seedlings with maximum number of leaves are removed with a ball  of earth for transplanting. If the seedlings are raised in polythene bags,  these can be straightway transported to any distance without much damage.<br />
  <strong>Planting</strong><br />
				  The planting is done during May- June  with the onset of monsoon. Arecanut palms need adequate protection from  exposure to the South Western sun as they are susceptible to sun-scorch. Proper  alignment of the palms in the plantation will minimize sun scorching of the  stem. In the square system of planting at a spacing of 2.7m X 2.7m, the North  South line should be deflected at an angle of 35 degree towards went. The  outermost row of plants on the southern and south-western sides can be  protected by covering the exposed stem with areca leaves or leaf sheaths or by  growing tall and quick growing shade trees. <br />
				  Pits of 90 X 90 X 90cm are dug and the  pits are filled with a mixture of top soil, powdered cow dung and sand to a  height of 50 to 60 cm from the bottom. The seedlings are planted in the centre  of the pit, covered with soil to the collar level and pressed around. A shade  of banana can be raised to give protection to the seedlings from sun scorch.<br />
  <strong>Manuring</strong><br />
				  Adequate supplies of plant nutrients in  the soil throughout the life of the crop are essential to get high yield.  Hence, an annual application of 100: 40: 140 g of NPK per tree in  the   form of fertilizers and 12 kg each of green leaf  and compost or cattle manure per bearing palm  is recommended. Under rainfed conditions, half the quantity of fertilizers may  be applied in April- May and the remaining quantity in Sep- Oct. Under  irrigated condition, the first dose of fertilizer is applied only in Feb. Green  leaf and compost can be applied in single dose in Sep- Oct. Irrespective of the  age of the plants, full dose of green leaf and compost or cattle manure may be  applied from the first year of planting itself while one-third of the  recommended quantity of fertilizers in the first year, two-third in the second  year and the full dose from the third year onwards. The first dose of  fertilizers may be broadcast around the base of each plant after weeding and  mixed with the soil by light forking, while the second dose is done in basins  around the palm dug to a depth of 15 to 20 cm and at 0.75 to 1m radius. In  acidic soils, required quantity of the lime may be applied during the dry  months and forked in.<br />
  <strong>Irrigation  and drainage</strong><br />
				  The palms should be irrigated once in  four to seven days depending on the soil type and climatic factors. In Kerala,  arecanut gardens are irrigated during dry months once in seven or eight days  during November-December., once in six days during March, April and May.  Adequate drainage should be provided during monsoon since the palms are unable  to withstand water logging. Drainage channels should be 25 to 30 cm deeper than  the bottom of the pits to drain excess water from the plot.<br />
  <strong>Other  operations</strong><br />
				  A light digging may be required when the  monsoon ends to break up any crust formed at the soil surface and also to   uproot weeds. Weeding should be done periodically  to keep the garden clean.<br />
  <strong>Cover  cropping</strong><br />
				  Cover crops, such as Mimosa invisia,  Stylosanthes gracillis and Calapogonium muconoides have been found to be  suitable for arecanut gardens. The cover crops may be sown in the month of  April-May and the green matter may be cut and applied to arecanut palms at the  time of second dose of fertilizer application.<br />
				  The crops which can be grown successfully  in arecanut gardens without loss of arecanut yields are banana, cocoa, pepper,  pineapple, betel vine; elephant foot yam, tapioca, dioscorea, sweet potato,  arrow root, ginger, turmeric and guinea grass. Nutmeg and clove can be also  grown in between four palms on alternate rows.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting  and processing</strong><br />
				  The stage of harvesting depends on the  type of produce to be prepared for the market. <br />
  <img src="lec15_clip_image006.jpg" alt="" width="229" height="153" hspace="12" align="left" /><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Dried  ripe nuts/Chali/Kottapak</strong><br />
				  The most popular trade type of arecanut  is the dried, whole nut known as chali or kottapak. Fully ripe, nine months old  fruits having yellow to orange red colour is the best suited for the above  purpose. Ripe fruits are dried in the sun for 35 to 40 days on dry leveled  ground. For drying and dehusking, sometimes fruits are cut longitudinally into  halves and sun dried for about 10 days, then the kernels is scooped out and  given a final drying.  <br />
  <img src="lec15_clip_image008.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="179" hspace="12" align="left" /><strong>2. Kalipak</strong> <br />
				  Another form of processing is by making kalipak. The nuts of 6  to 7 months maturity with dark green colour are dehusked, cut into pieces and  boiled with water of dilute extract from previous boiling; a kalli coating is  given and dried finally. Kali is the concentrated extract obtained from boiling  3 to 4 batches of Kalipak. <br />

				<p align="center"><strong>3. Scented suparis</strong><br />
				  <strong>       </strong>There are many varieties of scented  suparis. Dried arecanuts broken into bits, blended with flavour mixture and  packed. Formerly the bits were roasted in ghee or oil, but it is almost fully  given up nowadays, owing to development of rancidity. The flavouring of supari  varies with region and is a closely guarded secret.<br />
				  In South India scented supari is made  from kalipak like batlu Spices and synthetic flavours are added. Instead of raw  spices, nowadays, essential oils are used for easy blending. Rose essence as  well as menthol is very common. Coconut gratings are not added nowadays to  check microbial growth. These are usually packed in butter paper.<br />
				  Scented suparis popular in north and  central India are of two types; the one made from chali and the often from  kalipak. The former is more popular. At times, saccharin is used for  sweetening. Additives like colour and flavour are added. Plastic strips are  used for convenient packing. Tin and aluminum pouches are used for bulk packing  of scented supari. <br />
				  <strong>Post  harvest technology</strong> <br />
				  <img src="lec15_clip_image010.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="168" hspace="12" align="left" /><img src="lec15_clip_image012.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="167" hspace="12" align="left" />Dehusking of arecanut is traditionally  done by skilled manual labour with the help of a tool, which has a sickle  shaped small pointed blade fixed on a plant. A simple device for dehusking  arecanut, developed by CPCRI, Kasargod can also be used. The main advantage of  this device is that any unskilled person can operate it. The optimum is about  60 kg husked nuts  in case of dried nuts  and 30 kg in case of green nuts if one person operates the device for a day of  8 hours.<br />
				  <br />
				  In view of the declining use of  arecanut as masticatory, alternate and better uses of arecanut and the other  produces like spathe, husk are now thought of.<br />
				  <strong>Yield</strong><br />
				  More than 10 kg of ripe nuts per palm  at the 10th year is considered as normal yield in any plantation. <br />
				  <strong>Pest  management</strong><br />
				  <strong>Mites  (<em>Raoiella indica, Oligonychus indicus</em>)</strong> <br />
				  Adults and young ones suck the lower  surfaces of the leaves, causing them to turn yellow and bronzed appearance. The  mites can be controlled by spraying with dimethoate or Dicofol at 0.05 per  cent.<br />
				  <strong>Spindle  bug (<em>Carvalhoia arecae</em>)</strong> <br />
				  The feeding injury is caused on the  lamina and petiole. The affected leaves show dry brown patches.<br />
				  Spray crowns with carbaryl 50 WP.  The spray should reach the leaf axils. Repeat spraying after 30-35 days if pest  incidence continues. Placement of 2 g phorate 10G sachets on the top most two  leaf axils prevents the pest attack.<br />
				  <strong>Inflorescence  caterpillar (<em>Tirathaba mundella</em>)</strong><br />
				  <strong></strong>Caterpillar  feed on the flowers and clamp the inflorescence into a wet mass of frass with  silky threads. <br />
				  Force open the inflorescence out of  the enclosing spathe and spray Malathion 50 EC (250 ml in 100 litres of water).  Control slugs, which predispose inflorescence to the attack of caterpillar, by  using bait of Metaldehyde.<br />
				  <strong>Root  grub (<em>Leucopholis burmeisteri</em>)</strong><br />
				  Loosen soil around the base of palms  to a depth of 10-15 cm and drench with Chlorpyrifos 0.04% suspension twice, one  in May just before the onset of southwest monsoon and again in  September-October towards the close of the monsoon. Repeat application for 2 or  3 years consecutively to secure a complete eradication of the pest. Root grubs  can also be controlled by soil application of phorate 10G around the palms.<br />
				  <a name="disease" id="disease"><strong>Disease Management</strong></a> <strong> </strong><br />
				  <strong>Koleroga  (Mahali or fruit rot) (<em>Phytophthora  arecae</em>)</strong><br />
				  <strong>            </strong>Water soaked lesions appearing  on the nut surface near the perianth and spread over the other parts. Infected  nuts shed without perianth.<br />
				  Spray Bordeaux mixture 1% on all  bunches three times in a year, one just before the onset of southwest monsoon  and the rest at 40 days intervals. If monsoon season is prolonged give a third  spray. Use rosin soda adhesive to ensure tenacity of the spray deposit on  treated substrate. Remove and burn all fallen and infected nuts.<br />
				  <strong>Bud  rot (<em>Phytophthora palmivora</em>) </strong><br />
				  <strong>            </strong>Affected spindle appear yellow,  later changing to brown and finally the whole spindle rots. Remove and destroy affected spindle  and leaves. In early stages of infection, scoop out affected rotten tissues by  making longitudinal side splits and apply Bordeaux paste on the exposed healthy  tissues or drench crown with 1% Bordeaux mixture.<br />
				  <strong>Basal  stem rot (Anabe roga) (<em>Ganoderma lucidum</em>) </strong><br />
				  Small  brown irregular patches appear on the stem and a brownish exudates oozes out  from these patches<strong>.</strong><br />
				  <strong>Control</strong><br />
				  1. Isolate affected palms by digging trenches 60 cm deep and 30 cm wide around,  one metre away from the base and drench with Captan (0.3%), Calixin (0.1%) or  Copper oxychloride (0.3%)<br />
				  2. Remove and destroy all  severely affected palms and stumps of dead palms.<br />
				  3. Drench the soil with 1% Bordeaux mixture before planting healthy seedlings.<br />
				  4. Discourage growing of collateral hosts of fungus such as Delonix regia and  Pongamia glabra in the vicinity of gardens. <br />
				  5.  Apply 2 kg neem cake per palm.<br />
				  6.  Avoid flood irrigation and water flowing from infected palms to healthy palms.<br />
				  <strong>Yellow  leaf disease</strong><br />
				  <strong>            </strong>Leaves become yellow, smaller,  stiff and pointed, crown gets reduced, and palm remains stunted with few or no  nuts.<br />
				  Maintain the garden properly to keep  affected palms in a healthy condition by adopting recommended manurial,  cultural, plant protection and other management practices. Improve drainage  conditions in the garden.<br />
				  <strong>Band  disease</strong><br />
				  Improve soil conditions by loosening  hard soil strata, if present, by providing good drainage. Adopt adequate  control measures against spindle bug, mealy bugs, scales and mites. Where the  results of the above treatments are not found satisfactory, apply powdered mixture  of copper sulphate and lime in equal quantities @ 225 g/palm twice a year at  the base of affected palms. Application of borax @ 25 g/palm has been found to  have an ameliorative effect.<br />
				  <strong>Collar  rot of seedlings</strong><br />
				  Improve drainage conditions in  nursery beds and gardens. Drench spindle and base of seedlings with 1% Bordeaux  mixture in disease affected nursery or garden.<br />
				  <strong>Dieback  of inflorescence </strong><br />
				  Remove affected inflorescence  immediately. Spray Zineb (4 g in 1 litre of water) or Mancozeb (3 g/l) twice,  once just after female flowers are set and again 15-28 days later. Aureofungin  sol at 50 ppm concentration is also effective in controlling the disease.<br />
				  <strong>Stem  bleeding </strong><br />
				  Palms in the age group of 10-15  years are more prone to this disease. Symptoms appear on the basal portion of  the stem as small discoloured depression. Later, these spots coalesce and  cracks develop on the stem leading to disintegration of the fibrous tissues  inside. With the progress of the disease a brown exudates oozes out from these  cracks. High water table predisposes the palm to this disease.<br />
				  Improvement of drainage and root  feeding of 125 ml Tridemorph (1.5%) is suggested as control measure against  this disease.<br />
				  <strong>Sun  scorch</strong><br />
				  Protect palms from southwest sun by  wrapping stems with areca sheath or white-wash the exposed portion. Provide  reinforcement to palms showing stem fissures. Grow tall, quick growing trees on  southern and western sides of garden. <br />
				  <strong>Nut  splitting</strong><br />
				  This can be considered as a  physiological disorder than a disease. Palms in the age group of 10-25 years  are more susceptible. Symptoms are premature yellowing of the nuts when they  are half to three-fourth mature. Later splits develop at the tips, which extend  longitudinally exposing the kernel. Sometimes kernels also show splitting and  malformation. Rarely the kernel inside may exhibit splitting without visual  symptoms on the husk, resulting in nut fall. Hyper nutrition or sudden flush of  water after a period of drought or insufficient moisture in the soil is the  probable cause (s) of the disease.<br />
				  Improvement of drainage in ill  drained gardens and spraying of borax @ 2 g/litre of water are found effective  in reducing the disease incidence.<br />
