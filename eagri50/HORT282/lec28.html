				  <em>(Atropa belladonna L.) </em>Family: Solanaceae</p>
                <p><img src="lec28_clip_image002.jpg" alt="" width="315" height="284" hspace="12" align="left" />             Belladonna (<em>Atropa belladonna</em> C.B. Clarke.) belongs to the family Solanaceae.  Atrops is commonly called as &lsquo;Deadly nighShade&rsquo;. The commercial drug is  obtained from the leaves, flowering tops and roots of A.belladonna. Leaves and  roots of belladonna contain tropane alkaloids whose concentration varies from  0.13 to 0.70 per cent (average 0.45%). Belladonna leaves are widely used for  the manufacture of tinctures and plasters. The drug serves as an anodyne,  sedative, stimulant, antidiuretic, antiasthmtic, antispasmodic,  anti-inflammatory. It is also used in the treatment of renal and bilary colic,  stomach disorders and to stop sweating. The roots are primarily used in the  external treatment of gout, rheumatism and other affiliations.<br />
                  <strong>Soil</strong><br />
                  Belladonna grows well in deep  fertile soils of medium texture, which are rich in humus. Heavy clay soils  which are water-logged should be avoided to cultivate this crop.<br />

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Climate</strong><br />
                  It is a temperate crop. It behaves  as a perennial in temperate climates and gives maximum herbage and alkaloid  yield. In sub-tropical areas, it can be grown as a winter crop. However, the  plant behaves as an annual as it dies during the summer months and hence the  yield is poor.</p>

                  There are no named varieties in this  crop.<br />
                  <strong>Cultivation</strong><br />
                  <strong>Propagation</strong><br />
                  The crop is propagated through seeds  extracted from berries collected usually from September-November. Seeds may be  treated with 80 per cent sulphuric acid at the time of sowing for 2 minutes to  improve the germination.<br />
                  <strong>Nursery  raising</strong><br />
                  It can be cultivated by direct  sowing, but raising nursery gives best results. The nursery may be raised from  the second week of May to the end of autumn (September to October) under  sufficient shade. The land should be ploughed well so as to give a fine tilth.  Raised beds of size 3m x 1m surrounded by drainage and irrigation channels to  be made and apply well decomposed FYM to the soil. Seeds pretreated with  fungicides like Dithane M-45 or Agallol (10 g per kg of seeds) may be mixed  with fine soil (1:4 ratios) and broadcasting in the nursery beds. Cover the  seed beds with a layer of FYM and then with straw. Watering of beds should be  done immediately after sowing with a rose can.<br />
                  The seeds germinate in 3 weeks time.  Seedlings will be ready for planting in the field when they attain a height of  15-20 cm after 8-12 weeks.<br />
                  <strong>Transplanting</strong><br />
                  The ideal time for planting in the  field is March-April or October-November. Before planting, the seedlings are  treated with fungicide like Agallol. Seedlings are planted at a spacing of  50-60 cm in rows kept 60-70 cm apart. It is always safer to plant the seedlings  on raised beds with 1 m wide strips or ridges as it avoids water logging and  facilitates irrigation. The field may be irrigated immediately after  transplanting.<br />
                  <strong>Harvesting,  Processing and Yield</strong><br />
                  The first harvest of the leaves is  available three month after planting. Harvesting should be done as soon as the  plants start flowering, as it is the period when alkaloid content is higher.  The leaves are cut with the help of pruning scissors.<br />
                  Leaves are dried immediately after  the harvest under shade or sun or artificial heat with or without fans for air  circulation. Leaves should be turned over frequently while drying.<br />
                  The roots are also harvested after 3  years. After the harvest, they are washed, cut into 4 inches length, split  length wise if thick and shade or sun dried.<br />
                  During the first year an average of  1000 kg of dry herb is obtained. The yield increases to 1500 kg per hectare  during 2nd and 3rd year. The yield of dry roots will vary  from 170 to 335 kg per hectare.<br />
