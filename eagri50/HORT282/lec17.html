                <p><img src="lec17_clip_image002.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="251" hspace="12" align="left" />Cashew is native of south Eastern  Brazil, from where it was introduced to Malabar Coast of India in the sixteenth  century to cover baren hills and for soil conservation. <br />
                  Though India  produces only 40 percent of the world production of cashew nuts, it meets 90  percent of the world export of cashew kernels. The export earning from cashew  constitutes about 2 percent of the total foreign earning from agricultural  produces. Cashew growing area is centered only on the coastal area in India.  Kerala followed by Tamilnadu occupy more area under cashew nut.<br />
  <strong>Botany</strong><br />
                  The cashew tree  is a low spreading, evergreen tree with a very prominent tap root. The leaves  are alternative, simple, glabrous, obovate, round and pinnately veined. The  inflorescence is an indeterminate panicle of polygamomonoecious type i.e.  flowers are either bisexual or staminate but both occur intermixed in the same  inflorescence. On the same tree, the perfect flowers are larger in size than  the staminate. Pollination is carried out by flies, bees and ants as well as by  wind. <br />
                  The fleshy  peduncle, the &lsquo;cashew apple&rsquo;, is juicy and sweet when ripe. The apple varies in  size, colour, juice content and taste. It is rich source of vitamin c and  sugar. The cashew fruit is a kidney shaped drupaceous nut, greenish grey in  colour. The nuts vary in size, shape, weight (3-20g) and shelling % (15 –30%).</p>

                <p><strong>Climate and Soil</strong><br />
                  It is hardy tropical plant and does  not exact a very specific climate. It can come up in places situated within 35°  latitude on either side of the equator and also in the hill ranges up to 700 m  MSL. It can grow well in places receiving rainfall from 50 cm to 250cm and  tolerates a temperature range of 25°-49°c .It requires a bright weather and  does not tolerate excessive shade.<br />
                  Cashew is cultivated on a wide variety  of soils in India like laterite, red and coastal sandy soil. To a limited  extent, it is also grown on black soils. It can be also grown in hill slopes in  virgin organic matter rich soils. They do not prefer water logged or saline  soils.<br />
  <strong>Varieties: </strong>The important characteristics of some  of the cultivars of cashew are as follows. </p>

                <p><strong>Ullal-1:</strong>It is a high yielding (19.6 kg  nuts/tree) variety released for entire Karnataka. This is an early bearing  cultivar with high sex ratio (male: bisexual) and high shelling percentage  (30.7%).The size of the nut is medium. The flowering commences from last week  of November and extends up to middle of March and harvesting is completed by  May thus enabling to escape the monsoon showers which otherwise results in the  loss of crop. The variety has 144nuts per kg and medium sized apples with  yellow colour.<br />
                  <strong>Ullal-2: </strong>This is another high  yielding (17.9kg nuts /tree) variety released for entire Karnataka. This  variety also possesses desirable characters, such as, early flowering and  bearing, high sex ratio and high shelling percentage (30%) and as such highly  congenial for cultivation in hill zone. It has 164nuts/kg with medium sized and  yellowish red apple.<br />
                  <strong>Ullal-3:</strong> This variety flowers from  November-January and the flowering period extends for 60-70days.The nuts can be  harvested in January – March for nearly 60-90days.The average yield per tree is  14.68kg (at the 10th year) and the shelling percentage is 30.00.<br />
                  <strong>Selections  S-2 &amp; S-3: </strong>These  selections are released from National Cashew Research Centre (South Kanara) for  cultivation in Karnataka. They give an average yield of 8-10kg nuts/tree with a  shelling percentage of 29.</p>

                  <strong>       </strong>Seed propagation is seldom practiced except to raise  the rootstock materials.<br />
                  <img src="lec17_clip_image025.jpg" alt="" width="196" height="196" hspace="12" align="left" /><strong>Vegetative propagation</strong><br />
                  <strong>I. Selection of seed nuts </strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Collect  the nuts during heavy bearing period (Feb-April)</li>
                  <li>Sun  dry the nuts for 2-3 days</li>
                  <li>Select  the nuts which sinks in the 10 % salt (NaCl) solution </li>
                  <li>Sow  the nuts as early as possible, because after 6-8 months the germination of seed  nut get reduced. More than one year old seed nut should not be used</li>
                  <li>Very  big and very small seed nut should not be selected. Select only medium sized  nuts for sowing (130-150 nuts/kg).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>II.   Production  of root stocks</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Soak the seed nuts in water or cow  dung slurry for 2 days or 10 % Sodium hydroxide solution for one day to get  higher germination percentage.</li>
                  <li>Sow  the seeds in poly bags filled with potting mixture (25cm length, 13cm width and  250 gauge thickness)</li>
                  <li>Make  30 to 40 holes in each polythene bag for easy drainage of excess water</li>
                  <li>Apply  5g of super phosphate per bag along with potting mixture</li>
                  <li>Fill  the poly bags with potting mixture till the margin and put dried leaves or  small stones at base for easy drainage of water</li>
                  <li>Place  the seeds at 2.0 to 2.5 cm soil depth and keep vertically in which the stalk  end of the seed nut facing top</li>
                  <li>Apply  water after sowing and daily with rose cane and avoid water stagnation</li>
                  <li>Seeds  germinate with 15 to 20 days after sowing</li>
                  <li>Staggered  sowing at weekly intervals facilitate to make the stocks available continuously  for grafting</li>
                  <li>Provide shade to young root stocks;  after greening of leaves keep the stocks under open condition or remove the  shade</li>
                  <li>40 to 50 days old root stocks are  suitable for grafting</li>
                  <li>During the germination, the cotyledon  comes out of the soil and it is tasty, therefore it will be damaged by birds,  monkeys and other animals. So during this period it should be watched carefully</li>
                  <li>During this period, the root stocks  will be affected by root rot and bacterial leaf blight disease therefore to  prevent the root rot  apply 0.2% Thiram  or Mancozeb and spray for later apply 250ppm Streptomycin sulphate for  bacterial blight.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li>Good  healthy seedlings, without side shoot, growing straight should be selected</li>
                  <li>Better  to use the stocks raised in poly bags</li>
                  <li>Use  the stocks age of 25-30 days for grafting</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>IV.  Selection  and preparation of scion</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The  scion providing mother trees should be grown with good fertilizer application  and better management</li>
                  <li>The  shoots from unbeared terminal shoots of 3 to 5 month aged should be selected</li>
                  <li>Select  the scion of 10-12cm length, uniform pencil thickness with cream coloured bud.  The top 4 to 5 leaves of dark green in fully matured should be selected. 90  days old scion only will be used for grafting purpose which gives better graft  uptake. The selected scion sticks should be precured  by clipping off leaf blades, leaving petiole.                </li>
                </ul>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The  new shoots of September- October month are not need any precuring of scion  but  during other season retain the  petiole of leaves with scion</li>
                  <li>Precurred  scion can be used for grafting after 7-10 days. The petioles will shed while  touching with the fingers.</li>
                  <li>The  scion mother trees should not be allowed for flowering therefore during  flowering season panicles should be pruned</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>V. Collection of scion</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Collect the scion from the precurred  shoots because it will not dry quickly and gives more graft uptake</li>
                  <li>Collect  the scion before the new flush come from the terminal bud</li>
                  <li>Keep  the scion separately on variety wise</li>
                  <li>After  cutting of scion roll with wet cloth and keep in polythene bag and it can be  kept for 1-2 days.</li>
                </ul>

<p><strong>VI.  Preparation  of stock for grafting</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>In the selected root stock, trim all  the leaves except two pairs of basal leaves  </li>
                  <li>Decapitated  the stocks at 15cm height from the base</li>
                  <li>Make  a cleavage in the stock from top to 4.5cm in two equal portion  (Figure)</li>

<p><strong>VII. Preparation of scion for grafting</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Select  the scion of uniform thickness related to root stock</li>
                  <li>Make  the length of the scion to 10cm if more lengthy</li>
                  <li>Prepare  a vedge shape of 4.5cm length in proximal end of the scion after removing bark. </li>
                </ul>

                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>After  tying of grafted  stock, cover the top  with 25cm x 4cm 200guage poly bags, it prevents drying of scion</li>
                  <li>Keep  the grafted poly bags immediately inside the mist chamber for 15-20 days</li>
                  <li>After  15-20 days remove the poly bags placed over the grafts in inverted position</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Apply water to grafts daily with rose  can</li>
    <li>Prevent  the water stagnation during rainy season</li>
    <li>Remove  the polythene film used for joining the stock and scion after 45 days</li>
    <li>Remove  the shoots comes out from stocks whenever emerges</li>
    <li>60  days after grafting remove the leaves retained in the root stock.</li>
    <li>Many  of the grafts flower during flowering season. Therefore remove panicle if  grafts flowers</li>

  <P><STRONG>Planting </STRONG></P>
                  <p>       Pits of 45 x 45 x 45 cm are dug and  filled with a mixture of topsoil, 10 kg of farmyard manure and one kg of neem  cake at a distance of 7m x 7m either way during June and planted. In the case  of seedling, 45 days old seedlings are transplanted.</p>
                  <P><STRONG>After cultivation</STRONG></h1>
                  <p>       The interspaces may be ploughed after the  receipt of the rain and intercrops like groundnut or pulses or tapioca rose  normally till they reach there bearing stage.</p>
                  <P><STRONG>Training and pruning</STRONG></h1>
                  <p>       All the side shoots must be removed up to  a height of atleast 2m from the ground to cause the branches to form and spread  out from the upper section of the trunk. Periodical pruning of dead wood and  criss cross branches during the month of July is recommended to minimize the  losses through diseases such as dieback and to increase the yield.<br />
                    <strong>Weeding</strong><br />
                    Clearing the area by manually  within 2mtr radius of the trunk and slashing the remainder is essential until  the trees shade out most of the trees. Weeding can be done by chemically also.  Glyphosate (post emergent) application at 6 to 7 ml per litre of water (0.8 kg  a.i./ha) during June – July also effectively controls weeds.<br />
                    <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
                    In India cashew is grown  mainly under rain fed condition. However protective irrigation especially  summer months during January-march at fortnightly intervals @ 200 liters/plant  improves fruit set, fruit retention, thereby increasing nut yield.<br />
                    <strong>Mulching</strong><br />
                    Mulching the tree basins will  help in conservation of soil moisture and prevents soil erosion. Mulching with  organic matter or residues inhibits weed growth and reduces surface evaporation  during summer and also regulates the soil temperature.<br />
                  Under sloppy areas, soil and water  conservation practices can be done by making trenches of 30 cm width, 60 cm  depth. And convenient length may be taken in between rows along the contour.  This will not only conserve soil and moisture but will also enable to enhance  the growth of cashew.</p>
                  <h4>Manuring</h4>
                  <p>       Though a regular manurial schedule is not  followed by most of the growers, experiments show that application of organic  and inorganic manures are essential for higher yield in cashew. <br />
                  The  recommended manurial schedule is as follows (per tree per year):</p>

                    In places receiving both South West and  North East rainfall, the above quantity can be split into two equal doses and  applied and in areas receiving only North-East monsoon, the entire quantity is  applied during November. Nitrogen may also be given trough foliar spraying  (urea 1%) during July and November to get best result.<br />
                    <strong>Plant  protection</strong><br />
                    Tea mosquito, stem borer, thrips,  leaf minor and leaf blossom webber are important pests of cashew. Of these, tea  mosquito and stem borer causes economical damage in cashew.<br />
                    <strong>Tea  mosquito</strong><br />
                    Tea mosquito bug (<em>Helopeltis antonii </em>S.<em>)</em> can cause yield reduction to the tune of 30-40 per cent damaging tender shoots,  inflorescence and immature nuts at various stages of development. It attacks  the tree in all the seasons during flushing, flowering and fruit setting period  but the peak period of infestation is from October to March. To control the  pest, spray schedule involving three sprays synchronizing new flushing  (October-November), flowering (November-December) and fruit setting (January –  February) may be given with the following chemicals:- Quinalphos (25% EC) -  0.05%, Carbaryl (50% WP) - 0.01%, Phosphamidon (85% WSC) - 0.03%<br />
                    The number of sprays should be  limited to three and the same insecticide should be used for the subsequent  sprays.<br />
                  <strong>Stem  and root borer</strong> - Stem and root borer (<em>Placaederus  ferrugineus</em> L.) is also a dangerous pest and kill the entire plant. It is  mostly seen in neglected gardens. The larvae of the beetle tunnel into the tree  trunk and eat the bark all around the trunk. Manual removing of grubs and  pasting the damaged portion with mixture of Carbaryl 50 gm (50%) and copper Oxychloride  (25 gm) in one liter of water give effective control.</p>
                  <P><img src="lec17_clip_image053.jpg" alt="" width="116" height="156" hspace="12" align="left" /><STRONG>Harvesting</STRONG></P>
                  <p>       The cashew tree commences fruiting in the  third or fourth year, attains the full bearing age by the tenth year and lives  for 40 to 50 years. Flowering commences in November and extends upto February.  The peak months of harvest are March-April and the remaining crop comes to  harvest in February and May. The ripened will fall  down and nuts from fallen fruits have to be collected.<br />
                    <strong>Yield</strong><br />
                    The yield starting  from 1 kg in 3rd-4th year, yield goes on increasing as the canopy develops and  one can expect more that 10 kg of nuts in 8 to 10 years old plant depending on  management. <br />
                    <strong>Drying</strong><br />
                  The nuts collected should be dried  immediately under sun by spreading in a thin layer. If the surface is of cement  concrete, drying for two full days is sufficient. If the surface is of mud,  drying for 3 to 4 days is necessary. While drying, the nuts should be raked  quite often. Nuts should not be dried for more than four days since they become  brittle and break while processing, causing damage to the kernels.</p>
                  <P><STRONG>Top working </STRONG></P>
                  <p>       As most of the existing cashew  plantations are of seedling progenies, the yield level is very low and highly  erratic. Hence, top working with improved clones are suggested now. Tree of 20 –25  years old are beheaded at a height of 0.5m from the ground during December –  February. A paste, made using 50g each of BHC 50 per cent wettable powder and  copper oxychloride in a liter of water, should be applied all over the stump to  check any infection by invading pathogens and borer insects. Profuse sprouting  normally results in but only 10-15 healthy shoots and properly spaced on the  stumps are alone retained. These shoots are grafted at softwood stage (cleft  grafting) when they are about 40-50 days old. 7-8 successful grafts may be  encouraged to grow vigorously due to the well established root system and they  start yielding about 4 kg per tree from the second year of rejuvanation and the  yield gradually increase to stabilize at 8 kg from the fourth year of top  working.</p>
                  <P><STRONG>Cashew processing</STRONG></P>
                  <p>                Processing of cashew is defined  as the recovery of edible meat portion- the kernel from raw nuts, by manual or  mechanical means. In India, the processing is by manual means. It consists of;<br />
                    1.  Roasting  2. Shelling  3. Peeling 4. Grading 5. Packing<br />
                    1. Moisture  Conditioning or Humidifying:<br />
                  <strong></strong>A slight under roasting or  over roasting adversely affects the quality of the kernels. This is achieved by  a moisture step preceding the roasting. The raw nuts are sprinkled with water  and allowed to remain in moist condition for about 24-48 hours. This step is  known as conditioning. The optimum moisture level at the end of roasting is  reported to be 15-20%. Two important points to betaken care of during  conditioning are;</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The  water should not seep through the brown testa.</li>
                    <li>The  water should be free from iron contaminations.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Iron  contamination in the water can interact with polyphenolic materials of testa  and the resultant bluish black complex may give patches on white kernel. <br />
                    <strong> 2.</strong> <strong>Roasting </strong><br />
                    Roasting is designed to make shell brittle. <br />
                    <strong>a.  Open Pan Roasting</strong><br />
                    The earliest process was the pan roasting  wherein the nuts are heated on a metal pan over an open fire. Due to the heat  and slight charring the shells become brittle. The pan roasting is not followed  in organized sectors of industries. The two important methods of processing now  adopted are; a. Drum roasting and b. Oil bath roasting<br />
                    <strong>b.  Drum roasting</strong><br />
                    The nuts are fed into a rotating  hot drum, which ignites the shell portion of the nut. The drum maintains its  temperature because of the oil oozing out of the nuts. The drum is kept in  rotation by hand for about 2-4 minutes. The roasted nuts which are still  burning are covered with wood ash to absorb the oil on the surface. The rate of  shelling and the outturn of whole kernels are very high in this method.  However, the main disadvantage is the loss of CSNL which has a very high export  potential. In addition there will be considerable heat and acrid fumes in the  vicinity of this operation.     <br />
                    <strong>c.  Oil bath roasting</strong><br />
                    In this method, the nuts are  held in wire trays and are passed through a bath of cashew shell oil maintained  at a temperature of 200-202oC for a period of three minutes whereby the  shell oil is received from the shells to maximum possible extent. The vessel is  embedded in brick work and heated by a furnace which use spent shell as fuel.  During roasting, the shell gets heated and cell wall gets separated releasing  oil into bath. As the level rises the oil is recovered by continuous overflow  arrangement. The roasted nuts are then converted into a centrifuge. The  residual oil adhering to the surface of nuts is removed by centrifuging. The  roasted nuts are mixed with wood ash and sent for shelling. <br />
                    In Panruti (Tamilnadu) the conventional  roasting is completely avoided. The raw nuts are exposed to the intense sun  that is prevalent in that region. The well dried nuts are hand shelled. Here  also the CSNL is completely recovered. <br />
                    <strong>3.  Shelling</strong><br />
                    After roasting, shelling is done  by labour. Each nut is placed edgewise and cracked open with a light wooden  mallet and the kernel extracted with or without wire prong. Care has to be  taken that the inner kernel is intact and not broken into bits. After kernels  are removed from the shells they have to be dried to reduce the moisture to  loosen the adhering testa. <br />
                    <strong>4.  Peeling</strong><br />
                    Peeling is the removal of testa from the  kernels. This is done with help of safety pin or small hand knife.  Peeling is made easier when the kernels are  subjected to a heat treatment for about 4 hrs in a drying chamber.<br />
                    <strong>5.  Sweating</strong><br />
                    After peeling, the kernels are spread out  indoors on cement flooring so that they may absorb some moisture and become  less brittle. This prevents the tendency to break easily during grading.   <br />
                    <strong>6.  Grading</strong> <br />
                  The next stage in the processing is the  grading of kernels on the basis of specifications for exportable grades. There  are 25 exportable grades of cashew kernels. The kernels are stored into wholes,  splits and Broken primarily on the basis of visual characteristics. The wholes  are again size-graded on the basis of the number of kernels per 1Ib. The entire  grading operation is done manually. However for size-grading mechanical operation  is also practiced.</p>

                  <p><strong>7. Packing</strong><br />
                    Final operation is packing in 10 kg  capacity tins, which are subsequently evacuated and filled with carbon dioxide.  In some parts to overcome the possible over-drying a re-humidification step is  introduced before packing. The practice of filling with an inert gas is mainly  to combat infestation during transit. It may be pointed out that with high  quality nut, free from infestation, storing with or without carbon dioxide  makes very little difference particularly with reference to rancidity. The  importance of inert gas appears to be more for circumventing a possible insect  attack from an occasional insect egg entering the tin while packing.            <br />
                    Nitrogen can also do the same function.  However, carbon dioxide being a heavier gas is more convenient for handling.  Contention that absorption of carbon dioxide makes the kernel tastier does not  have much truth. In any case the processed kernels are rarely consumed without  a subsequent heat processing in the form of roasting frying and/or baking.                         <br />
                    <strong>By  products of cashew</strong><br />
                    After the processing of the shell and  other left outs are used making some other products. The major bye products of  cashew processing are:<br />
                  1.  Cashew Nut Shell Liquid     2. Shell  charcoal</p>
                  <p><strong>Cashew  Nut shell liquid (CNSL)</strong></p>
                  <p>       The pericarp of the nut consists of a  coriacious epicarp, spongy mesocarp and stony endocarp. The kernel covered with  testa membrane is contained in a shell 1/8 inch thick. The mesocarp consists of  a honeycomb network of cells containing a viscous liquid called cashew nut  shell liquid (CSNL), which provides a natural protection to the kernel against  insects. <br />
                    CSNL is a valuable raw material for a  number of polymer based industries like paints and varnishes, resins,  industrial and decorative laminates, brake linings and rubber compounding  resins. CNSL is traditionally obtained as a byproduct during the isolation of  kernel. The major constituent of shell oil is cardanol and anacardic acid of  which cardanol is separately extracted and used in many industries. The shell  oil was used as a preservative for boats and nets and to protect wood from  termites. It is now largely exported and used in the manufacture of plastics,  indelible inks, water proofing composition and other industrial products.<br />
                    <strong>Extraction  of CNSL</strong><br />
                  The extraction of CNSL involves various  methods viz. hot oil bath, expellers, kiln method, solvent extraction etc, the  most common method being hot oil bath. In this method the raw nuts are passed  through a bath of CNSL itself by which the CNSL is extracted. This method  extracts only 50% of liquid contained in nuts. Then through expellers about 90%  of liquid can be extracted. </p>
                  <p><strong>Cashew  shell charcoal</strong></p>
<p>         The remains of shell after the  extraction of CSNL is called shell charcoal. This is used as a fuel.  The shell charcoal is used in processing of  cashew for drying after shelling. <br />
