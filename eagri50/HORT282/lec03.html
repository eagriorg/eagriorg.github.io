				<p align="center"><strong>PEPPER</strong><br />
				  (<em>Piper  nigrum,</em> Piperaceae)</p>
				<p>     Black pepper, the king of spices, is obtained  from the perennial climbing vine, <em>Piper nigrum</em> which is indigenous to  the tropical forests of Western Ghats of South India.  It is one of the important and earliest known  spices produced and exported from India.   It is grown in about 1.36 lakhs ha land with an annual production of 32  thousand tonnes, largely distributed in Kerala (94%), Karnataka (5%), the rest  being Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and north eastern states especially Assam.  India accounts for 54 per cent of the total area under pepper in the world but  its share of production is only 26.6 per cent where as the other countries like  Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia accounts for lesser percentage of area but with  more share in the total production due to their productivity.  Annually, India is exporting about 41000  tones of black pepper earning a foreign exchange of Rs.240 crores.</h1>
				<p><strong>BOTANY</strong>
				<p>            It is a climbing evergreen plant and grows to a height of  10m or more.  The vines branch  horizontally from the nodes and do not attain length, but the full grown vines  completely cover the standard presenting the appearance of bush.  Based on growth habits, morphological  characters and biological functions, five distinct types of stem portions can  be identified in the shoot system of a pepper vine.</p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Main Stem</strong> which originate from a  seed or from a stem cutting.  It climbs  on a support with the aid of aerial or adventitious roots.</li>
				  <li><strong>Runner Shoots</strong> are produced from the  basal portion of the main stem, growing at right angle to the main stem,  usually restricted up to 50 cm from the ground</li>
				  <li><strong>Fruiting branches </strong>(<strong>Plagiotropes)</strong> are  produced from the nodes of the main stem and they grow laterally more or less  at right angles to the main stem, bearing the spikes.</li>
				  <li><strong>Topshoots (Orthotropes</strong>): After a period of  vertical growth, the top portion of the main shoots attains a bushy appearance  with shorter, thicker internodes and profuse branching with large number of  adventitious roots at the nodes.  This portion  of the main shoot is called top shoots or orthotropes.</li>
				  <li><strong>Hanging shoots  (Geotropes): I</strong>n a fully grown vine, some of the plagiotropes at the top portion  are seen to give rise to a special type of shoots which hang down and grow  geotropically.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><img src="lec03_clip_image002_0000.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="289" hspace="12" align="left" />    </p>
	      <p>The leaves are  broadly lanceolate, but wide variations occur in leaf shape and are arranged  alternately.  The inflorescence is a  catkin produced at the nodes opposite to the upper leaves.  Flowers are very minute. Monoecious or  dioecious or hermophrodite forms occur in different varieties.  High yielding forms should have more  percentage of bisexual flowers and in cultivated varieties these flowers will  be more than 80 per cent.  In case, if it  is less, it is compensated by the higher per cent of female flowers.  The male flowers are very few, 1 to 19 per  cent in different varieties.  The fruit  is a single seeded berry, which has a thin, soft pericarp surrounding the  seeds. It takes approximately six months to mature after flowering.  Fruit setting depends upon the sex of the vine;  season etc. and it will be normally about 50 percent in cultivated  varieties.  Sometimes, spike shedding  occurs to the extent of 14 to 65 percent causing considerable loss.  Spraying of IAA 50 ppm or planofix 50 ppm and  or zinc 0.5 per cent at the time of berry setting stage reduces spike shedding.<br />
                    <strong>Climate and soil</strong> <br />
				  Pepper is a plant  of humid tropics requiring adequate rainfall and humidity.  The hot and humid climate of sub mountainous  tracts of Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats is ideal for its growth.  It grows successfully between 200   north and south latitude and from sea level  up to 1500 meters above MSL.  The crop  tolerates temperatures between 100 and 400C.  A well distributed annual rainfall or 125-200  cm considered ideal for pepper.<br />
				  Pepper can be grown in  a wide range of soils such as clay loam, red loam, sandy loam and lateritic  soils with a pH of 4.5 to 6.0, though in its natural habitat, it thrives best  on virgin soil rich in organic matter.<br />
  <strong>Varieties</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Majority of the cultivated  types of pepper are monoecious.  Over 75  cultivars of pepper are being cultivated in India; Karimunda is the most  popular of all the established cultivars at Kottanadan, Narayakkodi,  Aimpiriyan, Neelamundi, Kuthiravally, Balancotta, Kulluvally, Malligesara and  Uddagare.  Recently a number of improved  cultivars have been evolved and released for cultivation.</p>

                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Propagation</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Pepper is propagated by  cuttings raised mainly from the runner shoots.   Cuttings from the lateral branches are seldom used, since in addition to  reduction in the number of fruiting shoots, the vines raised from them are  generally in raising pepper in pots.<br />
                  Runner shoots  from high yielding and healthy vines are kept coiled on wooden pegs fixed at  the base of the vine to prevent the shoots are separated from the vine in  February-March and after trimming the leaves, cuttings of 2 to 3 nodes each are  planted either in nursery beds or polythene bags filled with fertile soil.  Cuttings from middle 1/3 of the shoots are  desirable as they are high yielding.   Adequate shade is to be provided and irrigated frequently.  The cuttings will strike roots and become  ready for planting in May-June.  <br />
                  A rapid  multiplication technique has been developed by the National Research centre for  Spices, Calicut.  In this method, a  trench of 0.75 m deep rooting medium (preferably forest soil, sand and cow dung  mixture at 1:1:1. Split halves of bamboos with Septa with 8 to 10 cm diameter  and 1, 25 to 1.50 m length are fixed at 450 angles on a strong support.  The bamboos can be arranged touching one  another.  Rooted cuttings are planted in  the trench at the rate of one cutting each for one bamboo.  The lower portions of the bamboo are filled  with a rooting medium (coir dust and cattle manure mixture 1:1) and the growing  vine is tied to the bamboo in such a way as to keep the nodes pressed into the  rooting medium.  The tying could be done  with the dried banana sheath fibre.  The  vines are irrigated regularly.  As the  vines grow up, filling up the bamboo with rooting medium and tying each node,  pressing it down to the rooting medium are to be continued regularly.  For rapid growth, each vine is fed at 15 days  interval with 0.25 litres of nutrient solution prepared by dissolving urea (1  kg), super phosphate (0.75 kg), Muriate of potash (0.5 kg) and Magnesium  Sulphate (0.25 kg) in 250 litres of water.<br />
                  When the vine  reaches the top in about 3 to 4 months, the terminal bud is nipped off and the  vine is crushed at about three nodes above the base, in order to activate the  axillary buds.  After about 10 days, each  vine is cut at the crushed point and removed from the rooting medium and each  node is separated.  Such cuttings with  the bunch of roots intact are planted in polybags filled with pot mixture and  kept in a cool humid place.  Care should  be taken to keep the axil above the soil.   The buds start developing in about 3 weeks when the polybags can be  moved and kept in semi shade.  Subsequent  harvesting can be held at every 2-2 ½ months time.  The advantages of this method are  :1)Multiplication is rapid(1:40),(2) the root system is well developed, and (3)  a better field establishment and more vigorous growth as a result of better root  system.</p>
                <p>Establishment of plantations<br />
                  Selection of site<br />
                  When black pepper  is grown in slopes, the slopes facing south should be avoided and the lower  half of northern and north eastern slopes preferred for planting so that the  vines are not subjected to the scorching effect of the southern sun during  summer. <br />
  <strong>Preparation of  land and planting standards </strong><br />
                  With the receipt  of the first rain in May-June, primary stem cuttings of <em>Erythina sp</em>.(Murukku)  or <em>Garuga pinnata </em>(kilinjil) or <em>Grevillea robusta</em> (silver oak)  are planted in pits of 50 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm size filled with cow dung and top  soil, at a spacing of 3 m x 3 m which would accommodate about 1110 standards  per hectare (Seedlings of<em> Alianthus malabarica</em> (Matti) can  also be planted and the black pepper vines can be trailed on it after 3 years  when they attain sufficient height). Whenever E. indica is used as standard,  application of phorate 10 G @ 30 g may be done twice a year (May/June and  September/October) to control nematodes and stem and root borer. When E. indica  and G. pinnata are used, the primary stems are cut in March/April and stacked  in shade in groups. The stacked stems start sprouting in May. The stems are  planted in the edge of the pits dug for planting black pepper vines. Planting  Pits of 50 cm3 at a distance of 30 cm away from the base, on the  northern side of supporting tree are taken with the onset of monsoon. The pits  are filled with a mixture of top soil, farmyard manure @ five kg/pit and 150 g  rock phosphate. Neem cake @ one kg and Trichoderma harzianum @ 50 g also may be  mixed with the mixture at the time of planting. With the onset of monsoon,  two-three rooted cuttings of black pepper are planted individually in the pits  on the northern side of each standard. At least one node of the cutting should  be kept below the soil for better anchorage.<br />
  <strong>Cultural practices </strong> <br />
                  As the cuttings  grow, the shoots are tied to the standards as often as required. The young  vines should be protected from hot sun during summer by providing artificial  shade. Regulation of shade by lopping the branches of standards is necessary  not only for providing optimum light to the vines but also for enabling the  standards to grow straight. Adequate mulch with green leaf or organic matter  should be applied towards the end of North East monsoon. The base of the vines  should not be disturbed so as to avoid root damage.<br />
                  During the second  year, the same cultural practices are repeated. However, lopping of standards  should be done carefully from the fourth year onwards, not only to regulate  height of the standards, but also to shade the black pepper vines optimally.  Lopping may be done twice (during June and September) in a year. Excessive  shading during flowering and fruiting encourages pest infestations.<br />
                  From the fourth  year, two diggings are usually given, one during May-June, and the other  towards the end of south-west monsoon in October-November. Growing cover crops  like Calapogonium mucunoides and Mimosa invisa are also recommended under West  Coast conditions as an effective soil cover to prevent soil erosion during  rainy season. Further, they dry during summer, leaving thick organic mulch.<br />
                  Manuring and fertilizer application<br />
                  Manuring and  fertilizer application for pepper vines is to be done for black proper  establishment and growth of plants. Recommended nutrient dosage for black  pepper vines (3 years and above) are as follows.<br />
                  NPK 50:50: 150  grams/vine/year (General recommendation)<br />
                  NPK 50:50: 200  grams/vine/year (for Panniyur and similar areas)<br />
                  NPK 140:55: 270  grams/vine/year (for Kozhikode and similar areas)<br />
                  Only one-third of  this dosage should be applied during the first year which is increased to  two-thirds in the second year. The full dose is given from the third year  onwards. It is better to apply the fertilizers in two split doses, one in  May-June and the other in August- September. The fertilizers are applied at a  distance of about 30 cm all around the vine and covered with a thick layer of  soil. Care should be taken to avoid direct contact of fertilizers with roots of  black pepper. Organic manures in the form of cattle manure or compost can be  given @ 10 kg/vine during May. Neem cake @ 1 kg/vine can also be applied.  Application of lime @ 500 g/vine in April-May during alternate years is also  recommended. When biofertilizer like Azospirillum is applied @ 100 grams/vine,  the recommended nitrogen dose may be reduced by half to 70 g/vine. In soils  that are deficient in zinc or magnesium, foliar application of 0.25 per cent  zinc Sulphate twice a year (May-June and September-October) and soil application  of 150 grams/vine magnesium Sulphate, respectively is recommended. <br />
                  Plant protection <br />
                  Foot rot disease<br />
                  Foot rot (quick  wilt disease) caused by <strong><em>Phytophthora  capsici</em></strong> is the most destructive of all diseases and occurs mainly  during the south west monsoon season. <br />
                  Symptoms</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>One or more black spots appear on  the leaves which have a characteristic fine fibre like projections at the  advancing margins which rapidly enlarge and cause defoliation.</li>
                  <li>The tender leaves and succulent  shoot tips of freshly emerging runner shoots trailing on the soil turn black  when infected. The disease spreads to the entire vine, from these infected  runner shoots and leaves, during intermittent showers due to rain splash.</li>
                  <li>If the main stem at the ground  level or the collar is damaged, the entire vine wilts followed by shedding of  leaves and spikes with or without black spots. The branches break up at nodes  and the entire vine collapses within a month.</li>
                  <li>If the damage is confined to the  feeder roots, the expression of symptoms is delayed till the cessation of rain  and the vine starts showing declining symptoms such as yellowing, wilting,  defoliation and drying up of a part of the vine. This may occur during  October-November onwards. These vines may recover after the rains and survive  for more than two seasons till the root infection culminates in collar rot and  death of the vine.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Management<br />
                  The disease can be controlled by adopting integrated disease  management strategies. <br />
                  Phytosanitation</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Removal and destruction of dead  vines along with root system from the garden is essential as this reduces the  build up of inoculum (fungal population). </li>
                  <li>Planting material must be  collected from disease free gardens and the nursery preferably raised in  fumigated or solarized soil. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Cultural  practices </strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Adequate drainage should be  provided to reduce water stagnation.</li>
                  <li>Injury to the root system due to  cultural practices such as digging should be avoided.</li>
                  <li>The freshly emerging runner  shoots should not be allowed to trail on the ground. They must either be tied  back to the standard or pruned off.</li>
                  <li>The branches of support trees  must be pruned at the onset of monsoon to avoid build up of humidity and for  better penetration of sunlight. Reduced humidity and presence of sunlight  reduces the intensity of leaf infection.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Chemical control</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>            After the receipt  of a few monsoon showers (May-June), all the vines are to be drenched at a  radius of 45-50 cm with any one of the below four combinations</li>
                  <li>1. Copper oxychloride 0.2 per cent @ 5-10 litres/vine + A foliar  spray with Bordeaux mixture one per cent is also to be given</li>
                  <li>2. Potassium phosphonate 0.3 per cent @ 5-10 litres/vine + A  foliar spray with 0.3 per cent potassium phosphonate</li>
                  <li>3. Metalaxyl mancozeb 0.125 per cent @ 5-10 litres/vine + A foliar  spray with metalaxyl mancozeb 0.125 per cent may also be given.</li>
                  <li>4. Apply Trichoderma around the base of the vine @ 50 grams/vine  (this quantity is recommended for a substrate containing Trichoderma @ 1010  cfu) + A foliar spray with potassium phosphonate 0.3 per cent (or) Bordeaux  mixture one per cent is also to be given.</li>
                  <li>            Drenching and  spraying are to be repeated once again during August- September. A third round  of drenching may be given during October if the monsoon is prolonged.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Pollu disease (Anthracnose)<br />
                  This disease is  caused by <strong><em>Colletotrichum  gloeosporioides</em></strong><em>.</em> It can be distinguished from the pollu (hollow  berry) caused by the beetle by the presence of characteristic cracks on the  infected berries. The disease appears towards the end of the monsoon. The  affected berries show brown sunken patches during early stages and their  further development is affected. In later stages, the discolouration gradually  increases and the berries show the characteristic cross splitting. Finally, the  berries turn black and dry. The fungus also causes angular to irregular  brownish lesions with a chlorotic halo on the leaves. The disease can be  controlled by spraying Bordeaux mixture one per cent. <br />
                  Spike shedding<br />
                  Spike shedding  especially in varieties like Panniyur-1 at higher elevations like Coorg and  Idukki is one of the emerging diseases. It is seen in serious condition when  the pre-monsoon showers are delayed and flowering and spiking occur during  June-July. These spikes predominantly produce female flowers instead of  bisexual flowers. Heavy spike shedding may occur due to lack of pollination.  Irrigation of vines from second fortnight of March coupled with prophylactic  spraying with Bordeaux mixture one per cent or carbendazim 0.2 per cent reduces  the intensity of spike shedding. <br />
                  Stunt disease<br />
                  This disease which  is caused by viruses is noticed in parts of Kannur, Kasargod, Kozhikode,  Wayanad and Idukki Districts of Kerala and Kodagu, Hassan and Uthara Kannada  districts of Karnataka. The vines exhibit shortening of internodes to varying  degrees. The leaves become small and narrow with varying degrees of deformation  and appear leathery, puckered and crinkled. Chlorotic spots and streaks also  appear on the leaves occasionally. The yield of the affected vines decreases  gradually. Two viruses namely <strong>Cucumber  mosaic virus </strong>and a<strong> Badna virus</strong> are  associated with the disease. The major means of spread of the virus is through  the use of infected stem cuttings. The disease can also be transmitted through  insects like aphids and mealy bugs.<br />
                  The following strategies are recommended for the management of <em>the  disease.</em></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Use virus free healthy planting  material</li>
                  <li>Regular inspection and removal of  infected plants; the removed plants may be burnt or buried deep in soil</li>
                  <li>Insects such as aphids and mealy  bugs on the plant or standards should be controlled with insecticide spray such  as dimethoate or monocrotophos @ 0.05 per cent.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Phyllody disease<br />
                  This disease  which is caused by <strong>phytoplasma</strong> is  noticed in parts of Wayanad and Kozhikode districts of Kerala. The affected  vines exhibit varying stages of malformation of spikes. Some of the floral buds  are transformed into narrow leaf like structures. Such malformed spikes show  leafy structures instead of floral buds, exhibiting Phyllody symptoms. In  advanced stages, the leaves become small and chlorotic, and the internodes are  also shortened.<br />
                  The affected  fruiting laterals give a witches broom appearance. Severely affected vines  become unproductive. In severely affected vines the entire spike is converted  into small branches which appear chlorotic and the vines decline rapidly. The  infected vine becomes unproductive within two to three years. The infected  vines are to be destroyed to prevent the further spread of the disease.<br />
                  Slow decline (slow wilt)<br />
                  Slow decline is a  debilitating disease of black pepper. Foliar yellowing, defoliation and  die-back are the aerial symptoms of this disease. The affected vines exhibit  varying degrees of root degeneration due to infestation by <strong>plant parasitic nematodes</strong>. The diseased vines exhibit foliar  yellowing from October onwards coinciding with depletion of soil moisture. With  the onset of south west monsoon during May/June, some of the affected vines  recover and put forth fresh foliage. However, the symptoms reappear in  subsequent seasons after the cessation of the monsoon and the diseased vines  gradually lose their vigour and productivity. The affected vines show varying  degrees of feeder root loss and the expression of symptoms on the aerial parts  occur after a considerable portion of the feeder roots are lost. The root  system of diseased vines show varying degrees of necrosis and presence of root  galls due to infestation by plant parasitic nematodes such as Radopholus  similis and Meloidogyne incognita leading to rotting of feeder roots. The  damage to feeder roots is caused by these nematodes and <em>P.capsici</em> either  independently or together in combination. There is no spatial segregation of  plant parasitic nematodes and <em>P. capsici</em> in the soil under field  conditions. Hence, it is necessary to adopt a combination of fungicide and  nematicide application for the management of the disease.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Severely affected vines which are  beyond recovery should be removed from the plantation and destroyed.</li>
                  <li>The pits for planting should be  treated with phorate 10 G @ 15 grams or carbofuran 3 G @ 50 grams at the time  of planting.</li>
                  <li>Nematode free rooted cuttings  raised in fumigated or solarized nursery mixture should be used for planting in  the field.</li>
                  <li>Phorate 10 G @ 30 grams or  carbofuran 3 G @ 100 g/vine should be applied during May/June (with the onset  of south west monsoon) and September/October. Along with nematicides the basins  should be drenched with either copper oxychloride 0.2per cent or potassium  phosphonate 0.3 per cent or metalaxy 0.125 per cent.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>            In areas severely  infested with root knot nematodes, cuttings of the resistant variety Pournami  may be planted. Biocontrol agents like <em>Pochonia chlamydosporia or  Trichoderma harzianum</em> can be applied @ 50grams/vine twice a year (during  April-May and September-October). The fungus load in the substrate should be  108 cfu/g. While applying nematicides, the soil should be raked in the basin of  the vine lightly without causing damage to the root system and the nematicide  should be spread uniformly in the basin and covered with soil immediately. Sufficient  soil moisture should be ensured at the time of nematicide application. The  control measures should be taken up during early stages of the disease.<br />
                  Insect pests<br />
                  Pollu beetle<br />
                  The pollu beetle <em>(Longitarsus  nigripennis)</em> is the most destructive pest of black pepper and is more  serious in plains and at altitudes below 300 meters. The adult is a small black  beetle measuring about 2.5 mm x 1.5 mm, the head and thorax being yellowish  brown and the fore wings (elytra) black. Fully-grown grubs are creamy-white and  measure about five mm in length.<br />
                  The adult beetles feed and damage tender  leaves and spikes. The females lay eggs on tender spikes and berries. The grubs  bore into and feed on the internal tissues and the infested spikes turn black  and decay. The infested berries also turn black and crumble when pressed. The  term pollu denotes the hollow nature of the infested berries in Malayalam. The  pest infestation is more serious in shaded areas in the plantation. The pest  population is higher during September-October in the field. Regulation of shade  in the plantation reduces the population of the pest in the field. Spraying  quinalphos (0.05 per cent) during June-July and September-October or quinalphos  (0.05 per cent) during July and Neem gold (0.6 per cent) (Neem-based  insecticide) during August, September and October is effective for the  management of the pest. The underside of leaves (where adults are generally  seen) and spikes are to be sprayed thoroughly. <br />
  <strong>Top shoot borer </strong><br />
                  The top shoot  borer <em>(Cydia hemidoxa)</em> is a serious pest in younger plantations in all  black pepper areas. The adult is a tiny moth with a wing span of 10-15 mm with  crimson and yellow fore wings and grey hind wings. The larvae bore into tender  terminal shoots and feed on internal tissues resulting in blackening and  decaying of affected shoots. Fully-grown larvae are grayish green and measure  12-15mm in length. When successive new shoots are attacked, the growth of the  vine is affected. The pest infestation is higher during July to October when  numerous succulent shoots are available in the vines. Spray quinalphos (0.05  per cent) on tender terminal shoots; repeat spraying at monthly intervals  (during July-October) to protect emerging new shoots. <br />
                  Leaf  gall thrips<br />
                  Infestation by  leaf gall thrips <em>(Liothrips karnyi)</em> is more serious at higher altitudes  especially in younger vines and also in nurseries in the plains. The adults are  black and measure 2.5-3.0 mm in length. The larvae and pupae are creamy white.  The feeding activity of thrips on leaves causes the leaf margins to curl  downwards and inwards resulting in the formation of marginal leaf galls. Later  the infested leaves become crinkled and malformed. In severe cases of  infestation, the growth of younger vines and cuttings in the nursery is  affected. Spray dimethoate (0.05 per cent) during emergence of new flushes in  young vines in the field and cuttings in the nursery. <br />
                  Scale insects<br />
                  Among the various  scale insects recorded on black pepper, mussel scale <em>(Lepidosaphes piperis)</em> and coconut scale (Aspidiotus destructor) causes serious damage to black pepper  vines at higher altitudes and also to older cuttings in nurseries in the  plains. Females of mussel scales are elongated (about one mm length) and dark  brown and that of coconut scales circular (about one mm in diameter) and  yellowish brown. Scale insects are sedentary; remaining permanently fixed to  plant parts and appears as encrustations on stems, leaves and berries. They  feed on plant sap and cause yellowing and wilting of infested portions; in  severe cases of infestation the affected portions of vines dry up. The pest  infestation is more severe during the post monsoon and summer periods.<br />
                  Clip off and  destroy severely infested branches. Spray dimethoate (0.1 per cent) on affected  vines; repeat spraying after 21 days to control the infestation completely.  Initiate control measures during early stages of pest infestation. In nurseries  spraying Neem oil 0.3per cent or Neem gold 0.3 per cent or fish oil rosin three  per cent is also effective in controlling the pest infestation.<br />
                  Minor pests<br />
                  Leaf feeding  caterpillars, especially Synegia sp., damage leaves and spikes of younger vines  and can be controlled by spraying quinalphos (0.05 per cent). Mealy bugs, gall  midges and aphids infest tender shoots especially in nurseries. Spraying of  dimethoate (0.05 per cent) may be undertaken if infestations are severe. <br />
                  Mealy bug  infestation on roots can be controlled by drenching with chloropyriphos (0.075  per cent) and undertaking control measures <em>against Phytophthora and nematode  infections.</em><br />
  <strong>Harvesting and curing</strong><br />
  <img src="lec03_clip_image002_0001.jpg" alt="" width="119" height="155" hspace="12" align="left" />Pepper vines start yielding usually from the 3rd or 4th  year.  The vines flower in May-June.  It takes 6 to 8 months from flowering to  ripening stage.  Harvesting is done from  the November to February in the plains and January to March in the hills.  When one or two berries on the spikes turn  bright or red, the whole spike is plucked.<br />
                  Berries are  separated from the spikes by rubbing them between the hands or trampling them  under the feet.  After the separation,  the berries are dried in the sun for 7 to 10 days until the outer skin becomes  black and shrunken and assumes the characteristics wrinkled appearance of  commercial black pepper.  <br />
                  For making good  quality black pepper of uniform colour, the separated berries are collected in  a perforated bamboo basket or vessel and the basket with the berries is dipped  in boiling water for one minute.  The  basket is then taken out and drained.   The treated berries are sun dried on a clean bamboo mat or cement floor.<br />
                  White pepper of  commerce is prepared by removing the outer skin and the pulp below it before  drying the berries.  Spikes with fully  ripe berries are filled in gunny bags and steeped in flowing water for about 7  days.  Outer rind of the berries is then  removed by rubbing them with hands in a bucket of water and further cleaning  the seeds with fresh water.  The cleaned  seeds are dried for 3 to 4 days.  The  seeds which are now dull white in colour are further cleaned by winnowing and  polishing them by rubbing with a cloth.   The recovery of white pepper is about 25 per cent of ripe berries while  that of black pepper is about 33 percent.<br />
                  Considerable  advances have been made in recent years in the diversification of value and  added processed products from the pepper which has great demand.  They include 3 major groups viz., (a) green  pepper based products canned or bottled green pepper in brines, cured green  pepper, frozen green pepper, freeze dried green pepper, dehydrated green  pepper, green pepper pickles, green pepper flavoured products white pepper  (whole) or powder etc., (b) black pepper based products-Black pepper powder,  pepper oleoresins, pepper oils etc and (c) pepper by-products which have  medicinal, culinary and industrial uses.   These processed products earn more foreign exchange per unit weight  /volume.<br />
  <strong>Yield</strong><br />
  <strong>       </strong>Pepper vines attains full  bearing stage in the 7th or 8th  year after planting and it starts declining  after 20 to 25 years and replanting has to be done thereafter.  One hectare plantation of 7 or 8 years old  gives about 800 to 1000kg of black pepper.</p>
                <p><srtong>
            <strong>   Bush Pepper</strong></p>
                <p>       It is a method of  cultivating the vine in the form of bush.   One year old healthy fruiting branches are selected with 3 to 5 nodes  and all the leaves except the flag leaf are removed and planted in a shaded  area in the nursery, either in trenches or in polybags (45X30 cm) containing  moist coir dust.  Before planting, the  cuttings are dipped in 1000 ppm of IBA for 45 seconds.  After planting, the trenches are covered with  polythene sheets and in the case of polybags; the mouth is tightly tied with  coir thread to avoid moisture loss.  They  normally root in 30 to 50 days.  Such  rooted cuttings are planted in pots or fields after sufficient hardening  treatment. Cuttings grow like a bush and flower in the same year itself.  These bushes produce more and more of  fruiting branches only.  Adequate  manuring i.e., 2 to 5 kg of FYM along with 10g of NPK 1:1:2 mixtures may be  given per bush at 3 months interval.   Watering and plant protection may be adopted according to necessity.  Under average management a good bush pepper plant may yield 1.5 kg green pepper  in a span of 2 to 3 years.<br /></p>
