				<p align="center"><br />
				  <img src="lec25_clip_image002.jpg" alt="" width="332" height="234" hspace="12" align="left" />            Periwinkle  (<em>Catharanthus roseus </em>(L) G. Don),  belonging to the family Apocynaceae, is one of the few medicinal plants which  has found mention in the folks medicinal literature as early as 2nd BC.  The plant has been widely used as an  abortifient, purgative, antidiabetic, diuretic, hemorrhagic antimalarial,  antidysentric and against skin diseases by the ancient people.<br />
				  Modern  investigation have shown that periwinkle contains more than 100 alkaloids  distributed through all the parts of the plant like ajmalicine (raubasin),  serpentine and reserpine which are well known for their hypotensive and  antispasmodic properties Periwinkle gained further importance after the  isolation of vincrisine and vinblastine alkoloids which have importance in  cancer, therapy.  Vincristine sulphate is  being marked under the trade name ONCOVIN, which is used against acute  leukemia, and vinblastine sulphate as VELNR to cure Hodgkin&rsquo;s disease and other  lymphomas and chonocarcinomas.  In addition to the above, the alkaloids leurosidine,  leurosovine and rovidine also possess anticancer properties, but they are not  used clinically.<br />
  <strong>Origin and Distribution</strong><br />
				  The  plant is a native of Madagascar and from there it has spread to India,  Indonesia, Indo-China, Philippines, South Africa, lsrael, USA and other parts  of the world.  In India, it is being  grown in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and  Assam in an area of about 3000 ha.   Farmers prefer it because of its wide adaptability and its ability to  grow on marginal lands and drought-tolerance that rules out crop failure.  The presence of alkaloids all over the plant  body confers immunity to cattle browsing and the crop loss due to pilferage.<br />
				  USA  is the world&rsquo;s largest user of this plant&rsquo;s raw material.  A single firm which has the patent to  manufacture Vinblastine and Vincristine sulphate have been consuming more than  100 t of leaves of the plant annually.   Most of it has been imported from Malagasy and the remaining from India  and Mozambique.  Hungary is also been one  of the major consumer of its leaves followed by West Germany, Italy,  Netherlands (raubasin), serpentine, etc. The total demand for these countries  is more than 100 t of roots annually.  <br />
  <strong>Soil</strong><br />
				  The  crop is quite hardy and grows well on a wide variety of soils, except those  which are alkaline or water-logged.  Deep  sandy loam to loam soils of medium fertility are preferred for its large-scale  cultivation.  Because, in this soil there  is not only a better development of roots, but it is also easy to take them out  at harvest time.<br />
  <strong>Climate</strong><br />
				  The  distribution of the plant shows that there is no specificity in its climatic  requirements.  It comes up well in  tropical and subtropical areas.  However,  the growth in tropical areas is better than in the subtropical areas, where its  growth is slow due to the low temperatures in winter.  It can be successfully grown up to an  elevation of 1300 m above sea level. A well distributed rainfall of 100 cm or  more is ideal for raising this crop on a commercial scale under rainfed  conditions.<br />
  <strong>Manures and Fertilizers</strong><br />
				  In  areas where FYM is available, it is applied at the rate of 10-15 t/ha to obtain  good growth and yield from periwinkle plants.   If irrigation is available it is recommended to grow leguminous crops  like sun hemp or horse gram and when then reach the flowering stage bury them  inside the soil before sowing or transplanting periwinkle.  Green manure will act as a substitute for FYM  and is useful in the areas where it is either difficult to procure or it is very  expensive.  The seeds of the green manure  crop should preferably be treated with bacterial inoculants prior to sowing, to  increase the development of root nodules which absorb atmospheric nitrogen and  fix it in the soil.  In case organic  manure is not applied, it is advisable to apply a basal dose of 25 kg N, 50 kg  P2O­5 and 75 kg K2O per hectare per year.<br />
  <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
				  In  places where rainfall is distributed throughout the year, the plants do not  require any irrigation.  However, in  areas where rainfall in restricted to a few months in a particular period  approximately 4-5 irrigation will help the plants <br />
  <strong>Weed Control</strong><br />
				  This  crop requires two weedings in the initial stages of its growth.  The first weeding may be done about 60 days  of sowing and the second at 120 days at again.   Mulching the paid with cut grass or rice-straw will also minimize the  weed growth.<br />
				  Application  of the chemical weedicide Sinhar at 4-5 kg/ha as a pre-emergent spray is highly  effective against oil mount weeds similarly, the application of a mixture of  2-4-D and Grammaxone at the rate of 25 kg/ha to the soil before sowing keeps  the weeds under control.<br />
  <strong>Insect Pests and Diseases</strong><br />
				  The  plant is sufficiently hardy and practically free from the attack of insect  pests an diseases.  However, the oleander  hawk month is reported on this crop.   Occasionally, some plants have been found to suffer from the little leaf  disease, due to infection be mycoplasma resulting in stunted growth and  resetting of the leaves of the plant.   The disease can be effectively checked by uprooting and destroying the  affected plants.<br />
				  Recently,  another disease &lsquo;dieback&rsquo; or twig blight or top rot caused by <em>Pythium  butleri</em>, <em>Phytophthora nicotianae, P.debaryanum, Alternaria tenuissima</em> and <em>Colletotrichum demothum</em> has been found to affect the crop during the  monsoon in some parts of the country.   The disease can be controlled by spraying Dithane Z-78 at an interval of  10-15 days.  The other fungal diseases  reported on this crop are Fusarium wilt caused by <em>Fusarium solani</em> and <em>Sclerotiurn  rolfsi</em> blight caused by <em>Phthium  aphanidermatum</em> as well as leaf-sport caused by <em>Myrathesium raridum</em>. <em>A.  tenuissma, A. oltemata, Rhizoctonia solani, Ophiobolus catharanthicala,  Hoplosporella marahwadenis and Glomerella cingulata.</em><br />
  <strong>Harvesting</strong><br />
  <strong>i) Roots</strong><br />
				  The  crops are harvested after 12 months of sowing.   The plants are cut about 7.5 cm above the ground level and dried for the  stems leaves and seeds. The field is then copiously irrigated and when a  reaches the proper condition for digging, it is ploughed and the root are  collector.  The roots are later washed  well and dried in the shade.<br />
  <strong> ii) Leaves, Stem and Seeds</strong><br />
              If  there is a demand for leaves, two leaf stripping, the fist after 6 months and  the second after 9 months of sowing – can be taken.  A third leaf stripping is also obtained when  whole plant is harvested.  After the  plant is harvested it is dried in the shade. Its second nods dehisce and  release the seeds with a light threshing which can be used for the next  sowing.  The leaves and stems are also  collected separately.  It may be  mentioned here; that the seeds collected in this way will have poor germination  because they have been collected from pods in different degrades of maturity.  Therefore, in order to obtain good seeds it  is advisable to collect them from mature pods two to three months before the  harvest of the crop.  The aerial part of  the plant between 7.5 cm and about 25 cm above the ground level is taken as the  stem for the purpose of marketing.<br />
				  The  total alkaloid content in the leaf varies from 0.15 to 1.34%, of which the  average content of vinblastine is 0.002%, while that of vincristine is 0.005%.

				<p align="center"><br />
				  <strong>Yield</strong><br />
				  Under  irrigated conditions, about 4 t/ha of leaves, 1.5 t/ha of stem, and 1.5 t/ha of  roots on an air-dried basis may be obtained.   Whereas, under rainfed conditions, about 2 t/ha of leaves and 0.75 t/ha  each of stem and roots on an air-dried basis may be obtained.<br />
