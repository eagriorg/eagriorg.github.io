				<p><em><img src="lec26_clip_image002_0001.jpg" alt="" width="354" height="251" hspace="12" align="left" />Aloe </em>species,  perennial succulents belonging to the family <em>Liaceae, </em>are the source of  the drug aloe. Of the 275 species, there are three commercially important  species which are the main sources of the drug. They are: <em>A</em>. <em>barbadensis, </em>Mill. (2n = 14), (<em>A</em>. <em>vera </em> Linn) which yields Curacao aloe or Indian aloe  or Jaffarabad aloe or Barbados aloe, which is produced in the West Indies  (Curacao, Aruba, Bonaire) and <em>A</em>. <em>ferox </em>and its hybrids which  yield Cape aloe, produced in South Africa and A. <em>perryi </em>which yields the  socotrine aloe. Other aloe species (<em>A</em>. <em>africana </em>and A. spicata)  yield aloes of lesser importance.</p>
				<p><br />
				  Aloe is obtained by cutting the  leaves at their base and letting the yellow, bitter juice drain out. The water  is evaporated off from the juice by heat, and the resulting light to dark-brown  mass is the drug aloe. Of the two major products derived from the leaves, the  yellow, bitter juice present in specialized cells beneath the thick epidermis  yields the drug aloe and the parenchymatous tissue in the centre of the leaf  contains a mucilaginous gel which yields aloe gel or aloe vera gel; it is  currently obtained from A. <em>barbadensis.</em><br />
				  Aloe contains cathartic  anthraglycosides as its active principles; these are mostly C-glucosides,  notably barbaloin, which is a glucoside of aloe emodin. The concentrations of  these glucosides vary with the types of aloe ranging from 4.5 to 25% of aloin.  Other constituents present include aloesin and its aglycone aloesone (a  chromone), free anthraquinones (e.g. aloe-emodin) and resins.<br />
				  <em>            Aloe vera </em>gel contains a  glucomannan which is a polysaccharide similar to guar and <em>locust </em>bean-gums  and is believed to be the active constituent. Other constituents reported, or  otherwise claimed to be present, include other polysaccharides (containing  galactose, xylose and arabinose), steroids, organic acids, enzymes, antibiotic  principles, amino acids, biogenic stimulators, wound-healing hormones,  saponins, minerals, and so forth.<br />
				  Fresh aloe gel is well known for its  domestic medicinal value. For this reason, <em>Aloe vera </em>is also called  burn, first-aid or medicine plant. When freshly obtained, the gel has the  property of relieving thermal burns and sunburn, as well as promoting wound  healing; it also has moisturizing and emollient properties. The plant is used  as a home remedy for these purposes. The only officially recognized use of aloe  is its beneficial effect on the skin.<br />
				  Aloe and aloin are extensively used  as active ingredients in laxative preparations, often with other cathartics such  as buckthorn, cascara and senna; belladonna extracts are often included to  lessen griping. Aloin is also used in anti-obesity preparations. Aloe gel and  some­times the drug aloe are used as moisturizer, emollient or wound-healer in  various cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations. Extracts of aloe or aloin are  used in sunscreens, X-ray / burns, dermatitis, cutaneous leishmaniasis and  other cosmetic preparations. As a food, aloe extracts are used as a flavouring  ingredient primarily in alcoholic and non­alcoholic beverages and in candy to  impart a bitter note.<br />
				  <strong>Origin and  Distribution</strong><br />
				  Plants of the genus Aloebelong to the old world  and are indigenous to Eastern and Southern Africa, the Canary Islands and  Spain. The species spread to the Mediterranean basin and reached the West  Indies, India, China and other countries in the 16th century; and certain  species are now cultivated for commercial purposes, espe­cially in some of the  West Indian islands of the north coast of South America. It is also cultivated  throughout India.<br />
				  <strong>Description of  the Plant</strong><br />
				  <strong>Species and  Varieties</strong><br />
				  <strong>Soil</strong><br />
				  <em>            Aloe </em>is a hardy plant  and grows on a variety of soils. It does well in the sandy coastal to loamy  soils of the plains with a pH of up to 8.5. However, water-logged conditions  and problematic soils do not suit its cultivation.<br />
				  <strong>Climate</strong><br />
				  Aloeis usually  cultivated between March and June. The plant has a wide adaptability and can be  seen growing throughout the length and breadth of the country. It is found  growing in warm, humid or dry climate with even 150-200 cm to about 35-40 cm of  yearly rain­fall during the growing period. However, in dry regions, the crop  should be provided with protective irrigation.<br />
				  <strong>Land Preparation</strong><br />
				  Before cultivation, the land should  be ploughed twice and the field should be cleaned thoroughly of weeds. If  required, small canals may be prepared for drainage. About 25 t/ha of cow dung  manure is also added.</p>
				<p><strong>Cultivation</strong><br />
				  <strong>Propagation</strong><br />
				  The plants are generally propagated  by root-suckers or rhizome­ cuttings.<br />

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Planting</strong><br />
                  The plants are planted at a spacing  of 60 x 30 cm or 60 x 45 cm. About 15-18 cm-long root-suckers or  rhizome-cuttings are planted in such a way that two-thirds portion of the  root-sucker or rhizome­ cutting should be under the ground.<br />

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Manuring</strong><br />
                  It is a newly domesticated crop and  its full production technology including manurial requirement is yet to be  worked out. An <em>ad hoc </em>basis application of a mixture of 150 kg/ha of  nitrogen (N), potassium (K) and phosphorus (P) is recommended. The fertilizers  are applied in the soil near the root-system, after the plants are established.  30 kg of N and 120kg gypsum is recommended for Tamil Nadu.<br />
  <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
                  Soon after planting, the land should  be irrigated. During the crop period, irrigation must be provided according to  the moisture content of the soil. Generally, 4 to 5 irrigations per year are  sufficient. How­ever, water should not be allowed to stagnate near the plant.<br />
  <strong>Weeding</strong><br />
                  Weeding may be done twice a year and  the land should be kept weed-free.                </p>
                <p><strong>Pests and  Diseases</strong><br />
                  Normally, the plant is not affected  by any pests or diseases of a serious nature. But recently, the leaf-spot  disease caused by <em>Altarnaria alternata </em>and <em>Fusarium solani </em>has  been reported from India.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting and  Yield</strong><br />
                  The plants are harvested' eight  months after planting. While harvest­ing, the plants can be removed manually or  with the help of a tractor-drawn disc harrow or cultivator. The broken rhizome  part left in the soil throws out new sprouts in spring for raising the  succeeding crop. An aloe plantation gives a commercial yield from the second  year up to the age of five years, after which it needs replanting.<br />
                The yield of the crop on a  fresh-weight basis will be around 10,000-12,000 kg/ha.</p>
