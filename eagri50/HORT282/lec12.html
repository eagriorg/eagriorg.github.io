                <p><img src="lec12_clip_image002.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="335" hspace="12" align="left" />            Geranium  (<em>Pelargonium graveolens L.Herit</em>.) is  one of the important aromatic plants, yielding an essential oil which is highly  priced for its very profound and strong rose-like odour. The plant is also  known as rose geranium.  The chief  constituent of the oil are geranial and citronellol.  The oil also contains α-pinene,  β-pinene,   α-terpinene, myrcene,  α-phellandrene, limonene, cis-ocimene, trans ocimene, p-cymene, terpinolene,  cis-roseoxide, trans-rose oxide, methone, trans-linalool, iso-menthone,  caryophyllene, geranyl acetate, nerol, geranyl formate, geranayl butyrate and  geraniol.<br />
                The pure geranium  oil is almost a perfume by itself and blends well with all other perfumes.  It is widely used in scenting soaps and for  the isolation of rhodinal which forms part of most high-grade perfumes.  India is importing more than 20 t of this oil  from other countries to meet the local demands of the Indian perfumery  industries, in addition to an indigenous production of only about 20 t of oil  annually.</p>

                <p><strong>Origin and Distribution</strong><br />
                  Geranium is a  native of the Cape Province in South Africa.   It is commercially cultivated in France, Belgium, Spain, Morocco,  Madagascar, Egypt, Reunion Island, Congo, China, India and the former USSR  countries.  The world production of  geranium oil is estimated at 250-300 t, whereas the demand is more than 500 t  annually.  The first planting of  high-yielding Pelargonium graveolens, introduced from Reunion Island was grown  at Yercaud by a French planter, in the early twentieth century. From that time  onwards it has been cultivated as a commercial crop, but only in high altitude  areas with a milder climate.  However,  the crop also comes up well in the South Indian plains. Presently, it is being  commercially cultivated mainly in the Nilgiris and Kodaikanal Hills of Tamil  Nadu and in and around Bangalore in Karnataka in an area of about 2 000 ha.<br />
  <strong>Description of the Plant</strong><br />
                  The commercial  oil of geranium is obtained from <em>Pelargonium  graveolens</em>, L.Herit. (2n=88) of the family <em>Geraniaceae</em>. There are about 600 species of the genus Pelargonium,  many of which possess an agreeable odour.   Other species like <em>P.radula</em>, <em>P.fragrance</em> are of lesser importance and  have not attained any commercial significance.<br />
                Geranium is a  bushy, aromatic plant. The stem is cylindrical, woody at the base, pubescent,  green when young and turning brown with age.   The leaves are alternate, stipulate, simple, with 5 primary lobes and  secondary lobes and densely pubescent.   The leaves are highly aromatic in nature.  The inflorescence is umbellate and hairy. The  flower is bisexual, hypogenous, with a pink corolla; the two posterior petals  are larger with reddish-pumple markings.   There are 10 stamens, the filaments are sub equal, united at the base;  the anthers are 7, dithecous and shed easily.   The ovary is hairy, superior, pentacarpellary and syncarpous; the style  is hairy, breaking up distally into five stigma.</p>

                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Varieties</strong><br />
                 <p> <strong>1. Algerian or Tunisian</strong><br />
                  This type of  geranium is slender with flowers of a dark pink colour. It is being grown in  the Nilgiris and is unsuitable for wet conditions. This variety yields 50-60%  more oil with a more delicate odour then that of the Reunion type.<br />
  <strong>2. Reunion or Bourbon</strong><br />
                  Grown in the  Nilgiris and Anamalais, the plant is sturdier with light-pink flowers and more  suitable for wet conditions.  The oil  content is higher during the summer months from April to June.  The terminal portion with 6 to 12 leaves  contains more oil than the middle and basal portions.<br />
                  In the evaluation  trail of the Algerian and Reunion types, POG-7 and PG-20 respectively at the  Horticulture Research Station, Kodaikanal, the clone PG-7 recorded 0.3%  essential oil and 2.32 ml of oil per plant, and has been released under the  name &lsquo;KKL-1&rsquo;&rsquo;. The Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR),  Bangalore, has found &lsquo;Sel-8&rsquo; a Reunion type, as the highest yielder under  Bangalore conditions and has recommended it for cultivation. &lsquo;Hemanti&rsquo; &lsquo;Bipuli&rsquo;  and &lsquo;Kunti&rsquo; are the other varieties released by the CIMAP, Lucknow, for  cultivation in the plains of North India. Kelkar, Ooty, and IIHR Sel-8 are the  other varieties available in this crop.           <br />
  <strong>Soil</strong><br />
                  Geranium is  shallow-rooted crop and, as such, it requires well drained porous soil.  The crop is found to perform well in red  lateritic soils with a pH of 5.5-8.0, though a calcium rich porous soil is the  best.<br />
  <strong>Climate</strong><br />
                  Geranium can be  grown in temperate, subtropical and tropical climates at various altitudes from  1 000 to 2 200 m.  It thrives best in  subtropical climates with a temperature ranging from 5 degree C to 23 degree C.  However, temperatures below 3 degree C will kill the plant. Warm winters  coupled with mild summer temperatures and, well-distributed annual rainfall  ranging from 100-150 cm is ideal.  However,  heavy rainfall results in water-logging, causes root-rot and stunted growth. It  has been observed that it grows equally well at much lower altitudes and  tolerates higher temperatures up to 43 degree C in the plains when grown under  irrigated conditions. <br />
  <strong>Propagation</strong><br />
                  Geranium is  easily propagated by cuttings, since there is no seed setting in geranium,  vegetative propagation is must. Terminal cuttings about 20 cm long and  consisting of about 8 nodes are the best suited material for propagation, as  they give 80% rooting even without any treatment. However, the middle portion  and basal cuttings are reported to give poor rooting, which can be improved but  treating them for 6 minutes with growth regulators like IBA or IAA at 200 ppm.  Thus, a rooting of 80% and 6505 respectively can be obtained.  <br />
                  The cuttings are  planted in raised beds 3 m long and 1 m wide.   The soil should be well mixed with powdered FYM. The cuttings are  planted closely at a spacing of 8-10 cm. Before planting, the cut ends of the  cuttings are dipped in 0.1% Benlate solution. Before root initiation, temporary  shade is provided and the beds are watered regularly. The nursery is sprayed  with a 0.2% Urea solution at biweekly intervals and the cuttings are ready for  transplanting.  They can also be rooted  in polythene bags, which help to avoid damage to the root-system while planting  in the main field. This practice ensures a high percentage of success in the  field.<br />
                  Recently, its propagation through leaf petioles had also been  reported to give a good rooting percentage (75%), which will help to multiply  this plant in larger numbers than the traditional method of propagation using  20 cm-long cuttings.  The CIMAP, Lucknow,  has developed a protocol for large –scale production of geranium cell clones  and plants have been obtained under field conditions with improved oil-yield  and quality.  <br />
  <strong>Planting and  After-care   </strong><br />
                  About 30,000  cuttings are required for planting an area of 1 ha. Before planting, the land  should be properly prepared by ploughing (disc) and brought to a fine tilth.  Ridges and furrows are made, the application of fertilizer and irrigation  should be done a day prior to planting.   The cuttings are carefully dug out from the nursery and planted at a  spacing of 60 cm x 60 cm.  They must be  irrigated immediately after planting.   Irrigation is continued on alternate days for about 10-15 days and then  reduced to twice a week.  The schedule is  modified during the winter and summer months at intervals of 7 to 10 days,  depending on the situation.  Though  geranium tolerates short periods of drought, water-logging of the crop must be  completely avoided.  The crop c growth is  slow initially; weeds should, therefore, be removed periodically.  Intercropping of cowpea or black gram is  beneficial during the log phase and they do not affect the geranium crop. It  has been experimentally observed at the CIMAP. Lucknow, that polyhouse  cultivation reduces weed infestation, the number of irrigations and produced  less weed biomass.<br />
  <strong>Manures and Fertilizers</strong><br />
                  Prior to  transplanting the cuttings, 10 t of good quality FYM, 35 kg N,35 kg P2O5  and 35 kg K2O/ha are incorporated into the soil in the form of urea,  super phosphate and  Muriate of  potash.  A second dose of nitrogen at 35  kg/ha is applied about 2 months after the first application, Further, nitrogen  is given in two equal split doses for each harvest-the first dose being just  after the crop is harvested and the second two months later. Altogether, 210  kg/ha/yr of N is applied to the crop in six equal doses to cover three  harvests.  Application of 30 kg N/ha (15  kg/ha as basal and 15 kg as a foliar spray with 1% urea solution, 45 and 90  days after basal application) is reported to increase herbage yield and oil  yield by 447% and 140%, respectively, over the control.<br />
                  In addition, the  application of 20 kg/ha of zinc Sulphate and 10 kg/ha of boron has been  reported to increase the herbage yield.   Similarly, an application of copper (20 kg/ha) and molybdenum (30  kg/ha/year) in four split doses after each harvest has been found to increase  the yield by 37%.<br />
  <strong>Pests and Diseases</strong><br />
                  The incidence of pest and disease is not  severe in the geranium crop.  However, it  is found to be affected by wilt disease, caused by the <em>Fusarium</em> species, and <em>Botrydeplodia</em> <em>theobromae</em>, which are soil borne  fungi.<br />
                  Recently, <em>Alternaria alternate</em> has been reported  to cause leaf blight in the Terai region and Kumaon Hills of Utter Pradesh and <em>Sclerotium rolfsii</em> <em>causes</em>, collar-rot disease and <em>Rhizoctonia  solani </em>causes root-rot and wilt in the Kodaikanal region of Tamil Nadu.<br />
                  To avoid wilt disease, the following prophylactic measures are  recommended.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Dip the cuttings in 0.03% Benlate solution at the time of planting  in the nursery.</li>
                  <li>Prior to transplanting the rooted cuttings must be again dipped in  0.03% Benlate solution and then planted.</li>
                  <li>The crop is sprayed with 0.03% Benlate solution about 2 weeks  before it is harvested. Also after the harvest it is repeated, so that the  cut-ends are drenched with the fungicide.</li>
                  <li>It has been observed at the CIMAP, Lucknow, that the cultivation  of geranium in association with marigold (<em>Togetes  minuta</em>) improves the survival of geranium plants over the monsoon time in  the North Indian plains.  Roots-knot  nematodes, <em>Meloidogyne</em> <em>incognita </em>and <em>M.hapla</em>, a have been found to affect the geranium plant.  Application of Aldicarb @ 20 kg/ha to the  soil reduces the incidence of root-knot. </li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Harvesting </strong><br />
                  Geranium is  harvested 4 months after transplanting, when the leaves begin to turn  light-green and exhibit a change from a lemon-like odour to that of rose.  However, this requires careful observation  and experience. The crop should be harvested using a sharp sickle and sent for  distillation immediately.  The use of  sharp sickle is important as it minimizes the jerks, pulls and damage to the  crop while harvesting. After every harvest, hoeing, fertilizer application and  irrigation are done according to the schedule.   The plant then puts forth fresh shoots, grows faster, and reaches the  next harvesting stage in 4 months.  Thus,  a total of 3 harvests can be obtained for 3-6 years.  Cultivation under polyhouse conditions is  reported to reduce the harvest time by 21 days.<br />
                  The essential oil  is distributed over the green parts of the plant, particularly in the  leaves.  The oil content is higher during  the summer months, from April to June.   The terminal portion with 6-12 leaves contains more oil than the middle  and basal portions.<br />
  <strong>Yield</strong><br />
                  The quality and  yield of oil will be better if the crop is harvested at the appropriate time of  maturity.  For a higher yield, a good  plant population in the field is necessary.   A minimum of 25,000 plants should be maintained in a hectare in a year  which, in turn, may yield 15 kg of oil on distillation.  The recovery of the oil ranges from 0.08 to  0.15%, depending upon the season of harvest and type of material. Cultivation  under polyhouse cover is reported to increase herb and oil yields up to 53%  over the conventional planting of the geranium crop.<br />
  <strong>Distillation of Oil</strong><br />
                  The  freshly-harvested terminals are used for the distillation of oil.  The plant material is stacked near the stills  for about 12 to 24 hours.  This results  in a slight fermentation and splitting of the glycosides, which increases the  yield of oil.  The oil is extracted by a  simple distillation method.  The herbage  is tightly packed in a still over the perforated grid and tamped down tightly  and the still-head is clamped shut.            The steam is generated in a separate  boiler and conveyed to the still.  The  oil volatilizes and escapes along with the steam vapours, which is later  condensed by passing it through a condenser with running cold water.  The condensed oil is separated from the water  by the differential density method and clarified by filtering it with activated  carbon.<br />
