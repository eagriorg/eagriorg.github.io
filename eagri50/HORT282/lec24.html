  <img src="lec24_clip_image002.jpg" alt="" width="324" height="283" hspace="12" align="left" />  The  &lsquo;Sacred basil&rsquo; or &lsquo;Holy basil&rsquo;, <em>Ocimum  sanctum Linn.</em> (2n=32) a biennial or triennial shrub belonging to the family <em>Lamiaceae</em>, is commonly cultivated in  gardens: it is frequently found as an escape. The species is worshipped by the  Hindus of India and traditionally grown in courtyards and temples. The leaves  of this basil, on steam-distillation, yield a bright yellow, volatile oil  possessing a pleasant odour characteristic of the plant, with an appreciable  note of cloves.<br />
                  The plant contains mainly phenols,  aldehydes, tannina, saponin and fats. The essential oil components are eugenol  (about 71%, eugenol methyl ether (20%),nerol caryophyllene, selinene, α-pinene,  β-pinene,camphorcineole, linalool and carvacrol (3%).A terpeneurobsolic acid  possessing anticancer properties has also been isolated. The seeds of this  plant give a greenish-yellow fixed oil and also contain antistaphlocoagulase which can be extracted  with water and alcohol.<br />
                  The plant is also used as a pot  herb: its leaves are used as a condiment in salads, and other dishes. The  leaves, seed and root are medicinally useful. The leaves also contain ascorbic  acid (82 mg 100 g) and carotene (2.5 mg/100 g). The juice of the leaves  possesses diaphoretic, antiperiodic. Stimulating, expectorant and antipyretic  properties: it is used in catarrh and bronchitis, applied to the skin in  ringworm and other cutaneous diseases and as drops to relieve earache. An  infusion of the leaves is used as a stomachic in gastric disorders of children.  If taken internally, it strengthens the liver and heart and is a good  appetizer. It cures amenorrhea and promotes the secretion of milk in lactating  women. The leaves, if chewed, give relief from toothache. The leaf-juice is  applied to reduce inflammations. A decoction of the root is given as a  diaphoretic in malarial fevers. The dried and powdered root, if taken twice  daily for seven days, cures spermatorrhoea.<br />
                  The seeds are mucilaginous and  demulcent and are given in disorders of the genitor-urinary system. The seeds  rubbed in water are given for irritation coughs, gonorrhea, labour pains and  dysentery. The seeds rubbed with cow&rsquo;s milk are given for vomiting and  diarrhea. The juice of the fresh leaves, flower-tops and the slender roots are  considered to be good antidotes for snakebite and scorpion sting. Tribes  (Sandals) use the plant in cholera, cough postnatal complaints, hemorrhagic  septicemia and dog bite. The volatile oil is reported to possess antibacterial  and insecticidal properties. It inhibits the in vitro growth of <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </em>and <em>Micrococcus pyrognes</em> var. <em>aureus</em>. It has marked insecticidal  activity against mosquitoes.<br />
  <strong>Origin and Distribution</strong><br />
                  <em>O.  Sanctum</em> has wide distributions, covering the entire Indian subcontinent,  ascending up to 1,800 m in the Himalayas and as far as the Andaman and Nicobar  Islands. This plant-occupies a wide range of habitats.<br />
  <strong>Description of the Plant</strong><br />
                  It is an erect, herbaceous,  much-branched softly hairy, biennial or triennial plant, 30-75 cm high. The  leaves are elliptic-oblong, acute or obtuse, entire or serrate, pubescent on  both sides, minutely gland dotted. The flowers are purplish or crimson, in  racemes, close-whorled. The nutlets are subglobose or broadly ellipsoid,  slightly compressed, nearly smooth, pale-brown or reddish with small, black  markings.</p>

                <p><strong>Types and Varieties</strong><br />
                  In India, two types of <em>O.sanctum</em> are under cultivation: the  green type (Sri Tulsi) is the most common, the second type (Krishna Tulsi)  bears purple leaves and is preferred in the trade for its higher potency of the  drug.<br />
                  <strong>Green Type                                        Purple  type</strong><br />
  <img src="lec24_clip_image011.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="208" hspace="12" align="left" /><img src="lec24_clip_image013.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="210" hspace="12" align="left" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Soil</strong><br />
                  It thrives well on a variety of  soils. Rich loam to poor laterite, saline and alkaline to moderately acidic  soils are all well suited for its cultivation. Well-drained soils aid in better  vegetative growth. Water-logged conditions can cause root-rot and result in  stunted growth.<br />
  <strong>Climate</strong><br />
                  The plant can be grown under  partially shaded conditions but it yields less oil. It flourishes well under  fairly high rainfall and humid conditions. Long days and high temperatures have  been found favourable for the plant growth and oil production. Tropical and  subtropical climate (at altitudes up to 900 m) are suited for its cultivation.  The plant is moderately tolerant to drought and frost.<br />
  <strong>Season</strong><br />
                  The nursery can be raised in the  third week of February and transplanting is generally started in the middle of  April. This can be undertaking in the month of March, if the seedlings are  raised in beds.<br />
  <strong>Land Preparation</strong><br />
                  The land is brought to a fine tilth  and laid out into plots of convenient sizes for irrigation. It is preferable to  add 15t/ha of FYM during the preparation of the land.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Cultivation</strong><br />
                  <strong>Propagation</strong><br />
                  The plant is propagated by seeds.  The seeds are likely to deteriorate in future generations on account of the  highly cross-pollinated nature of the crop. Hence, for fresh plantings, the  growers have to take fresh seeds from the pedigree stock. <br />
  <strong>Nursery raising</strong><br />
                  Raised seed-beds of 15&rsquo;x4&rsquo;x9&rsquo; size  should be thoroughly prepared, by the addition on FYM. About 200-300 g seeds  are enough to raise seedlings for planting one hectare of land. The seeds  should be sown 2 cm deep in the nursery beds. After sowing the seeds in the  nursery, a mixture of FYM and soil is thinly spread over the seeds and  irrigated with a sprinkler hose. The seeds germinate in 8-12 days and the  seedlings are ready for transplanting in about 6 weeks time, at the 4-5 leaf  stage. A spray of 2% urea solution on the nursery plants 15 to 20 days before  transplanting helps in raising very healthy plants for transplanting.<br />
  <strong>Transplanting</strong><br />
                  It is recommended to plant the  seedlings at a distance of 40 cmx40 cm, 40 cmx50 cm and 50 cmx30 cm to get high  herbage and oil-yield per hectare at Lucknow, New Delhi and Indore,  respectively. The plots are irrigated immediately after transplanting. The  seedlings will establish well by the time of the second irrigation. At the  stage gap planting and replacement of the poor plants is done so that a   uniform stand is achieved.<br />

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Fertilizer Application</strong><br />
                  The application of 120 kg/ha each of  P2O5 and K2O is recommended for saline and  alkaline soils at Lucknow. The optimum fertilizer dose recommended for this  crop is 120 kg N and 60 kg P2O5/ha. Half the dose of N  and the entire dose of P2O5 are given as a basal dose.  Whereas, the remaining N is applied in two split doses, after the first and  second cuttings. The application of the micronutrients Co and Mn at 50 and 100  ppm concentrations, respectively, is reported to increase the oil-yield  significantly. <br />
  <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
                  Irrigation depends upon the  moisture   content of the soil. In  summer, 3 irrigations per month are necessary whereas, during the remaining  period, it should be done as and when required, except in the rainy season when  no irrigation is necessary. Altogether, about 12-15 irrigations years are  sufficient. <br />
  <strong>Weeding</strong><br />
                  The first weeding is done one month  after planting, and the second 4 weeks after the first. After this, no further  weeding is required as the plants become bushy, thereby naturally suppressing  the weeds.<br />
  <strong>Interculture</strong><br />
                  One hoeing, two months after  planting, is sufficient. The crop may also be earthed-up at this stage.<br />
  <strong>Diseases and Pests </strong><br />
                  The plant is susceptible to powdery  mildew caused by <em>Oidium s</em>pp., seedling blight caused by <em>Rhizoctonia  solani </em>and roor-rot caused by <em>Rhizoctonia bataticola</em>. Powdery mildew  can be controlled by spraying wet table sulphur   (4 g/I of water), and the latter two  diseases are managed by improved phytosanitary measures and by drenching the  nursery-beds with a solution of mercurial fungicide.<br />
                  Among the insects, the larvae of  leaf-rollers sticking to the under surface of the leaves fold them backwards  lengthwise, thus webbing them. Malathion (0.2%) may be sprayed to control this  insect.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting and Yield</strong><br />
                  The crop is harvested when it is in  full bloom. The first harvest is obtained 90-95 days after planting.  Afterwards, it may be harvested at every 65-75 days, intervals. Harvesting  should be done on bright, sunny days in order to obtain good quality oil-yield.  It is not desirable to harvest the crop if it has rained the previous day.<br />
                  The crop should be cut 15-20 cm  above ground-level. The harvested produce may be allowed to wilt in the field  itself for 4-5 hours, to reduce the moisture content and the bulkiness.<br />
                  About 5 t/ha of fresh herbage can be  obtained twice or thrice a year. </p>
                <p><strong>Distillation of Oil</strong><br />
                  The harvested produce is usually  distilled in its fresh form. However, the oil quality and yield do not diminish  up to 6-8 hours after harvest, buy any further delay may cause considerable  loss in yield and quality of oil. Steam-distillation is found to be superior to  water distillation. The whole herb contains 0.1 to 0.23% essential oil. The  yield of oil varies with the type, season and place of origin. The oil-yield  will be approximately 10-23 kg/ha.</p>
