				  (<em>Vetiveria zizanioides, </em>Poaceae) </p>
                <p><img src="lec11_clip_image002.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="231" hspace="12" align="left" /><strong>            </strong>Vetiver oil is obtained by  steam distillation of roots of vetiver (<em>Vetiveria zizanioides</em>). The oil  is one of the finest oriental perfumes with a persistent fragrance. The oil is  used in the manufacture of soaps, cosmetics, perfumery, agarbathis, soft  drinks; pan masala etc. In blended perfumes, oil of vetiver acts as excellent  fixatives for volatile compounds. It is known for its cooling properties. It  grows well in wastelands-sandy, marginal land where conventional cropping is  uneconomic. Vetiver is extremely hardy and can tolerate submergence for a  considerable period as well as withstand drought situation. Cultivation of  vetiver for 3-4 cycles improves sandy soils to a greater extent and makes them  suitable for growing common agricultural crops more profitably.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>                       
                <p><strong>Demand and Supply of  vetiver oil</strong><br />
                  In India as well as the World Market, the demand for  vetiver oil is increasing day by day due to its unique odour, for which it is  used in both flavour and fragrance industries. One more reason for increase in  demand is that this oil cannot be substituted with reconstituted oil and cannot  be made synthetically. It is used for Base-note in flavour and fragrance and  the percent usage varies from 20-50% to 60-70 %. That means it has enough  market potential and there is no doubt on its consumption. The internal demand  particularly of Northern type oil always falls short of supply. The world  production of vetiver oil is around 300 tons per annum of which India contributes  about 20-25 tons. Haiti, Indonesia (only Java), and Reunion produce most of the  world&rsquo;s vetiver oil. In India it is cultivated in the states of Rajasthan,  Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, with an annual  production of about 20 tons of oil. Its demand for perfumes, essence, attar,  soap and also as food flavour etc is greater than indigenous production.  Quantity wise the Indian vetiver oil, especially North Indian origin is  considered to be the best in the world market. The Indian consumption at  present is about 100 tons and more than 80 % is met by import. <strong></strong><br />
                  The vetiver oil from North Indian origin is considered to  be the best in the world market.<br />
                  <strong>Improved varieties</strong><br />
                  KS-1 (Bharatpur type) an improved selection released by  CIMAP is recommended for commercial cultivation in Assam. Other improved  varieties are Gulabi, Dharaini and Kesar. <br />
                  <strong>Soil and Climate</strong><br />
                  Vetiver grows in any type of soil but a rich and fairly  well drained loam is considered best. The loamy soils, which are loose in  texture, are ideal for root growth and harvesting as well. Vetiver plant also  grows on a variety of problematic soils like waterlogged soils, sandy soils and  areas with high water table and flood prone. A luxuriant growth of healthier  root is obtained from plants growing under warm and damp conditions on rich,  temporary inundated, marshy land. The Charlands of The Brahmaputra and its main  tributaries and newly silted land that turned otherwise unfit for most common  agricultural crops may be identified as potential areas for vetiver  cultivation. It grows best in areas with warm summer and well-distributed  rainfall.<br />
                  <strong>Propagation</strong><br />
                  Vetiver can be propagated by tillers and slips. Tillers  take longer time for growing and therefore, slips are the better planting  material for propagation. Preferably it is propagated by slips. Plants are cut  at 25-30 cm above ground and dug out for preparation of slips. The culms are  divided into slips with 2-3 tillers. These slips are jabbed into ground like  seedling. Although the growth may be slow initially, the plants develop quickly  once roots are established. The plant responds to fertilizers and irrigation  with massive tillering, and each tiller can be broken off and planted.<br />
                  <strong>Raising of initial nursery</strong><br />
                  A nursery should be set up preferably on light soil so  that plants can be pulled up easily. For quick multiplication, nursery should  be manured liberally by FYM or Compost @20-25 t/ha. DAP @75 kg/ha may also be  applied at the time of planting to encourage fast tillering the slips in the  nursery should be planted at 30 x 30 cm apart. After second weeding urea @ 60  kg/ha may be top dressed. The multiplication rate could be about 80-100 in two  steps a year. Nursery raised on 300-400 sq. m area may be sufficient for 1  hectare area within 6 months.<br />
                  <strong>Land preparation</strong><br />
                  Vetiver field should be free of perennial weeds and  shrubs. After clearing, the land is deep tilled. With the onset of pre-monsoon  shower final land preparation is done.<br />
                  <strong>Field layout and bed  formation</strong><br />
                  For uniform cropping and higher root yield the fields are  laid out into beds of convenient size.<br />
                  <strong>Planting time</strong><br />
                  With pre-monsoon shower April- August is considered most  ideal time for commercial cultivation. In flood affected areas the crop should  be established before floodwater submerges it. Therefore, it should be planted  before 2 months ahead of normal flood.<br />
                  <strong>Planting</strong><br />
                  After division into slips the fibrous roots are also  removed leaving 5-8 cm from the base of the root. These are planted in lines at  45 x 30 cm spacing. Flat bed planting followed by ridging (after 30 days of  planting) produces higher roots and essential oil. Planting is done in holes  5-8 cm deep. The soil around the slips is pressed firmly and leveled. From an  average sized clump about 20-30 healthy slips can be obtained. One-hectare area  requires about 75,000 slips when planted at 45 x 30 cm spacing. If planting is  done during rain free period, field should be irrigated immediately after  planting.<br />
                  <strong>Manuring and fertilization</strong><br />
                  In poor soils 40kg each of nitrogen, phosphorus and  potassium per acre is applied before final ploughing. In second year of crop  growth 40 kg nitrogen is top-dressed after rain in June. In the first year  depending on soil fertility and crop growth 20 kg N may be top-dressed at about  4 months after planting. Depending on availability, the crop may be given 10-12  t/ac FYM or compost at planting supplemented with urea one month after planting  to stimulate growth.<br />
                  <strong>Fertilizer requirement per  crop cycle (18 months)/hectare</strong><br />
                  A fertilizer dose of 100 kg N, 40 kg P2O5 and 40 kg K2O  per hectare is recommended.<br />
                  <strong>In fertilizer form</strong> <br />
                  <strong>Basal application:</strong><br />
                  Urea  90 kg<br />
                  Single  super phosphate (SSP) 250 kg<br />
                  Muriate  of potash (MOP) 67 kg<strong> being transplanted</strong><br />
                  <strong>Top-dress </strong>(after 4 months of planting)<strong></strong><br />
                  Urea  45 kg<br />
                  In  second year<br />
                  During  June Urea 87 kg<br />
                  <strong>Intercultural operations</strong><br />
                  Initial growth of vetiver for first 60-70 days is very  slow, hence inter row space virtually remain vacant allowing infestation and  faster growth of <em>kharif </em>weeds which compete with crop plants for light,  moisture and nutrients. 2-3 weedings at an interval of about a month are needed  during the initial period of growth. In the second year one weeding is done  before harvest to facilitate the harvesting and avoid of any root of weeds  getting mixed with roots of the crop.<br />
                  <strong>Use of herbicides</strong><br />
                  Herbicide Atrazine @ 0.5 kg a.i/ha (50% a.i) as pre  emergence to weed and before transplanting gives a weed free condition for  first 75-90 days, after which the crop is able to cover the ground surface.<br />
                  <strong>Earthing up Vetiver after  shoot cutting</strong><br />
                  Earthing up after weeding is beneficial to the crop.  Earthing up encourages root growth at the crown due to better rhizospheric  environment provided to the growing plants.<br />
                  <strong>Shoot cutting</strong><br />
                  The cutting of aerial portion with commencement of winter  (November) increases tillering and consequently gives more roots per plant.  Shoot cutting is done twice during the crop cycle. First shoot cutting is done  at 30 cm height in planting year to achieve regeneration for second year, while  second time cutting is done at 15-20 cm height before harvesting to facilitate  digging of roots.<br />
                  <strong>Inter cropping</strong><br />
                  Vetiver slips are planted in rainy season at a spacing of  45 x 30 cm. The crop growth in initial stages is very slow and inters row space  remains free for weed infestation, which grow at a faster rate and compete with  crop plants for moisture and nutrients. The open space can be used efficiently  for raising intercrop without affecting the main crop yield. Growing of early  maturing pulses like green gram, black gram, cluster bean (French bean) in <em>kharif </em>and toria and corianderin the subsequent <em>rabi </em>season found to  improve the productivity and also give higher net profit per unit time and  space.  Cowpea, <em>Dhaincha </em>seed can  be sown in the row spaces and incorporate them after 50-60 days of growth as  green manure. This will add organic matter, which ultimately is helpful for  better root growth.<br />
                  <strong>Planting on paddy field leaves</strong><br />
                  Vetiver grows well on the field levees, which can keep  them stabilized. To avoid shading effect the foliage can be trimmed time to  time. If planted in July – August with <em>Sali </em>rice, the root will be ready  for harvest in second year Nov-Dec i.e., just after harvest of second crop.<br />
                  <strong>Precaution</strong><br />
                  Vetiver by its nature grows best by the riverside. The  economic part of the crop is its dug up roots upto a depth of 30-40 cm.  Therefore, under any situation vetiver for its root production should not be  undertaken in areas where soil erosion is a common feature. Though it can be  grown even in erosion prone land with proper control measure, harvesting should  be restricted to the central area of the standing crop, leaving thick, hedge  like boundary line totally undisturbed.<br />
                  <strong>Diseases and pests</strong><br />
                  <strong>Black scale insect</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The black scale insects rarely move, the young nymphs settle and  insert their mouthparts. They suck the sap of the plant and the growth is  checked and vigour is reduced, ultimately the plant may die. Spraying of  metasystox @ 0.04% will be effective to control the scale insect.<br />
                  <strong>Harvesting</strong><br />
                  Harvesting is done in between 15-18 months to get fully  developed root system and high quality of oil. Harvesting earlier than 15  months after planting, the immature roots yield oil of poor quality with green  earthy odour. Properly developed somewhat thicker roots, yields an oil of  better quality and its optical rotation and specific gravity are higher, the  odour fuller, richer, more lasting. Oils derived from older roots are usually  of darker colour than the oils distilled from the younger roots. If the roots  stay in ground for over two years, the yield of oil diminishes considerably as  the root system tend to become woody and lose in essential oil content and the  oil becomes very viscous with a dark colour but of high quality.<br />
                  In general the  crop is harvested after 15-18 months during the dry season from December to  February for best quality oil. Oil content of root starts decreasing after20  months age considerably. For harvesting, the moist areas are taken up first.  The water logged areas become dry enough in February for digging up the roots.  After February due to rising temperature, the soil become harder and makes  digging very difficult. At this stage the finer roots stay in the ground, which  contain more oil resulting low yield per unit area.<br />
                  <strong>Characteristics to determine  correct harvesting age</strong><br />
                  The roots that possess the  following characteristics have good oil content. It should<br />
                  1. Expose a hard surface  when the skin is peeled off<br />
                  2. be thick, hard, long  and wiry and<br />
                  3. Give a very bitter  taste when chewed<br />
                  <strong>Digging</strong><br />
                  The stem portion is cut at a height of 15-20 cm and the  clumps are uprooted. About 50-60 % of the roots come away with the clump when  dig out by spade or tractor drawn single disc leaving the rest in the soil. The  clumps are beaten on a piece of log to remove earth adhering to the roots and  the roots are separated from the plants with a sharp knife. As far as possible,  re-digging the soil also collects the roots left in the soil. One irrigation  may be given before harvesting to facilitate digging if available. For  mechanical harvesting a disc plough with single disc mounted on a tractor can  be used which uproot the roots from 30-35 cm depth. This process saves manpower  and also gives about 15 % higher root recovery over manual digging. The length  of the roots varies from 10-35 cm according to the condition of growth, soil,  climate etc of the locality. Thicker roots produce more oil. Very light or  almost white roots contain very little oil.<br />
  <img src="lec11_clip_image004.jpg" alt="" width="174" height="252" hspace="12" align="left" /><strong>Washing / Cleaning</strong><br />
                  The harvested roots contain large quantities of earth  sticking to them. Immediately after harvest, the roots are washed gently in  clean running water to remove the adhering earth taking care so that the finer  roots are not lost.<br />
                  <strong>Drying</strong><br />
  <img src="lec11_clip_image006.jpg" alt="" width="266" height="200" hspace="12" align="left" />            The cleaned roots are spread on drying grounds. The roots  are turned over at regular intervals until dry. During this process foreign  matter if any is removed from the mass. The cleaned and dried roots are sent to  distillery or storage shed where they are allowed to mature. Drying is done  under shade for 1-2 days, which improves the olfactory quality of the essential  oil. Prolonged drying in the sun reduces the oil yield. Dry roots can be stored  in shade for 60-70 days without loss of oil but quality improves appreciably.<br />
  <strong>Yield of roots</strong><br />
                  The age, the soil, climatic conditions and also the  strain are important factors governing the yield of roots. On an average, 30-45  q/ha of dry root is obtained under good management. At 0.4% average recovery  the oil yield of 12-20 kg oil/ha may be obtained.<br />
                  <strong>Distillation</strong><br />
                  The essential oil is extracted from the roots by steam  distillation. Freshly harvested roots on distillation give higher yield of oil  than stored roots; the yield decreases progressively with the period of  storage. The roots are soaked for 18-20 hours in water prior to distillation to  render the root material soft and thereby further facilitate release of oil.  Fresh roots when cut to lengths 2.5 cm – 5 cm increases recovery. As the most  valuable quality constituents are contained in the high boiling fractions, the  roots must be distilled for a prolonged period ranging from 20-24 hours. North  Indian varieties yield 0.4 to 0.8 of oil. During distillation two  fractions-lighter and heavier oils are obtained. In the start highly volatile  lighter fraction released first and a considerable amount of which may escape  before it gets cooled and collected in liquid phase. To avoid this loss a piece  of <em>marking </em>cloth  after cleaning is tied at delivery outlet in the swollen balloon shape in the  receiver keeping it submerged in water. The lighter fraction that is likely to  escape along with the steam/gas or running distillate water would be trapped in  the cloth. As the distillation progress the heavier fraction will get deposited  in the cloth and the lighter will pass through cloth and get collected in the  receiver. At the end of the distillation the cloth is squeezed to get the oil.          This piece of cloth is repeatedly used  till tear off. Before thrown off, the cloth may be washed by diethyl ether  (solvent) to get back the adhering oil. This practice helps in increased  recovery of oil. Traditionally copper vessel with S.S condenser is found good  for vetiver since the oil react with free copper turns bluish in colour which  fetches more prices in perfumery market. The traditionally distilled oil which  often called &ldquo;Ruhe khus&rdquo; done in Kannauj type &ldquo;Deg Vopka&rdquo; although recovery is  comparatively low fetches the highest price in perfumery market. <br />
                  <strong>Quality aspects</strong><br />
                  Distillation technique plays an important role in oil  quality. By adopting the right steam pressure and by adjusting the post harvest  treatment of roots, yield as well as quality can be improved. There are  hundreds of small constituents in vetiver oil. However, the &lsquo;Khusimol&rsquo; content  in oil, minimum of which should be 14% or more and low in caryophyllene.  Besides extraction procedures the oil quality is governed by varietal  selection, harvesting at proper age (15-18 months) and during dry period only.<br />
                  <strong>Bi-products</strong><br />
                  Roots left after oil extraction is used for making  cartons and many handicrafts items like Mats, Aasa (for sitting), pen-stand  etc. A simple <em>sharbat </em>(syrup) can be prepared by using water obtained  during distillation, which on analysis found to be tasty and best for health  also.<br />
                  <strong>The oil and its Uses</strong><br />
                  The oil is used extensively in perfume industry and in  the manufacture of scented toiletries as fixative and also as odour contributor  in base etc. It also has uses in the food industry as flavour agent. The  essential oil is reddish dark brown when matured and has a woody, earthy smell  that is almost musty. The oil has a strong odour (that may not be to everyone&rsquo;s  taste) and should be well diluted to avoid it being too overpowering in a  blend. Vetiver oil is used as part of the woody notes for luxury perfumes. The  oil of vetiver, patchouli and sandalwood in combination with jasmine and  gardenia complex, is the base of the famous <em>Crepe de Chine </em>note. In  addition to its importance in classical perfumery, vetiver oil is also used as  base for many modern men&rsquo;s colognes.<br />
                  <strong>Medicinal uses</strong><br />
                  Therapeutically, vetiver oil has a profoundly relaxing  effect on the nervous system, relieving tension and stress. It can be used to  good effect in the treatment of insomnia. In India, vetiver oil is known as the  oil of tranquility. In baths or in massage, vetiver is beneficial in the  treatment of the symptoms of disorders such as arthritis, rheumatism and a  chin, stiff muscles. It is warming and comforting and will help to relieve the  tension that is often associated with chronic pain. Vetiver oil also benefits the  circulatory system, stimulating and warming, especially when used in  combination with massage. In skin care, the antiseptic and slightly astringent  properties of vetiver can be used to good effect in the treatment of oily skin  that is prone to spots. <br />
