				<p align="left"><strong>Warehousing  </strong><br />
                  <strong>Meaning and Functions</strong><br />
            Warehouses are scientific storage  structures especially constructed for the protection of the quantity and  quality of stored products. Warehousing may be defined as the assumption of  responsibility for the storage of goods. It may be called the protector of  national wealth, for the produce stored in warehouses is preserved and  protected against rodents, insects and pests, and against the ill-effect of  moisture and dampness.<br />
            The warehousing scheme in India is an  integrated scheme of scientific storage, rural credit, price stabilization and  market intelligence and is intended to supplement the efforts of co-operative  institutions. The important functions of warehouses are:<br />
            <strong>1. Scientific Storage:</strong> Here,  a large bulk of agricultural commodities may be stored. The product is  protected against quantitative and qualitative losses by the use of such  methods of preservation as are necessary.<br />
            <strong>2. Financing:</strong> Warehouses meet  the financial needs of the person who stores the product. Nationalized banks  advance credit on the security of the warehouse receipt issued for the stored  products to the extent of 75 to 80 per cent of their value.<br />
            <strong>3. Price Stabilization:</strong> Warehouses help in price stabilization of agricultural commodities by checking  the tendency to making post-harvest sales among the farmers. Farmers or traders  can store their products during the post-harvest season, when prices are low  because of the glut in the market. Warehouse helps in staggering the supplies  throughout the year. They thus help in the stabilization of agricultural  prices.<br />
            <strong>4. Market Intelligence:</strong> Warehouses also offer the facility of market information to persons who hold  their produce in them. They inform them about the prices prevailing in the  period, and advise them on when to market their products.<br />
            This facility helps in preventing  distress sales for immediate money needs or because of lack of proper storage  facilities. It gives the producer holding power; he can wait for the emergence  of favourable market conditions and get the best value for his product.<br />
<strong>Types of Warehouses</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>Warehouses  may be classified on two bases:<br />
<strong>1. On the Basis of Ownership</strong><br />
<strong>            (a) Private Warehouses:</strong> These are the warehouses which are owned by the government and are meant for  the storage of goods of any member of the public against a prescribed storage  charge. The method of operation and the charges for storage are regulated by  the government.<br />
            <strong>(b) Bonded Warehouses:</strong> These  warehouses are specially constructed at a seaport or an airport and accept  imported goods for storage till the payment of customs by the importer of  goods. These warehouses are licensed by the government for this purpose. The  owner of the warehouse gives an undertaking to the government that customs duty  will be collected from the person before he is allowed to remove the goods from  the warehouse. In other words, the goods stored in this warehouse are bonded  goods. They may be owned by the dock authorities or privately-owned; but they  have to work under the close supervision and control of the customs  authorities. The following services are rendered by bonded warehouses:<br />
            (i) The importer of goods is saved  from the botheration of paying customs duty all at one time because he can take  delivery of the goods in parts.<br />
            (ii) The operation necessary for the  maintenance of the quality of goods – spraying and dusting, are done regularly.<br />
            (iii) Entrepot trade (re-export of  imported goods) becomes possible. The importer may take delivery of the goods  without paying the customs duty if they are to be re-exported. He is thus saved  from the botheration of first making the payment of customs duties on imported  goods and then getting a refund on re-exported goods.<br />
<strong>2. On the Basis of Type of Commodities  Stored</strong><br />
<strong>            (a) General Warehouses:</strong> These are ordinary warehouses used for storage of most of foodgrains,  fertilizers etc. In constructing such warehouses no commodity-specific  requirement is kept in view.<br />
            <strong>(b) Special Commodity Warehouses:</strong> These are warehouses which are specially constructed for the storage of  specific commodities like cotton, tobacco, wool and petroleum products. They  are constructed on the basis of the specific requirements of the commodity.<br />
            <strong>(c) Refrigerated Warehouses:</strong> These are warehouses in which temperature is maintained as per requirements and  are meant for such perishable commodities as vegetables, fruits, fish, eggs and  meat. The temperature in these warehouses is maintained below 30o to  50oF or even less, so that the product may not get spoiled by high  atmospheric temperature.<br />
<strong>Warehousing in India</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>In  1928, the Royal Commission on Agriculture underscored the need for a  warehousing system in India.  The Central Banking Enquiry Committee, 1931, too, drew attention to this need.  The Reserve Bank of India  emphasized the need for warehouses as early as in 1944, and proposed that every  State Government should enact legislation to regulate the functioning of  warehouses. The All-India Rural Credit Survey Committee of the Reserve Bank of India (set up  in 1951 and submitted its report in 1954) also made comprehensive  recommendations for the development of warehousing as an integrated scheme of  rural credit and marketing. As a result of the recommendations of the  Committee, the Government of India enacted the Agricultural Produce  (Development and Warehousing) Corporations Act, 1956. The Act provided for:<br />
            (a) The establishment of a National  Co-operative Development and Warehousing Board (which was set up on 1st September, 1956);<br />
            (b) The establishment of the Central  Warehousing Corporation (which was established at Delhi on 2nd March, 1957); and<br />
            (c) The establishment of State  Warehousing Corporations in all the States in the country (which were  established in various states between July 1957 and August 1958).<br />
            In 1962, the Government of India  decided to break up the Act of 1956 into two separate Acts – the National  Co-operative Development Corporation Act, 1962, and the Warehousing  Corporations Act, 1962. The Warehousing Corporations Act came into operation on  18th March, 1962.  The Act defines the specific functions and the area of operations of Central  and State Warehousing Corporations. It enlarged the list of the number of  commodities meant for storage.<br />
<strong>(a) National Co-operative Development  and Warehousing Board</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>This  board was set up on 1st   September 1956 to perform the following functions:<br />
            (i) To advance loans and grants to  State Governments for financing co-operative societies engaged in the  marketing, processing or storage of agricultural produce, including  contributions to the share capital of these institutions;<br />
            (ii) To provide funds to warehousing  corporations and the State Governments for financing co-operative societies for  the purchase of agricultural produce on behalf of the Central Government.<br />
            (iii) To subscribe to the share  capital of the Central Warehousing Corporation and advance loans to State  Warehousing Corporations and the Central Warehousing Corporation;<br />
            (iv) To plan and promote programmes  through co-operative societies for the supply of inputs for the development of  agriculture; and<br />
            (v) To administer the National  Warehousing Development Fund.<br />
            In March 1963, the Board was  converted into the National Co-operative Development Corporation (NCDC), and  its functions were limited to co-operative development.<br />
<strong>(b) Central Warehousing Corporation  (CWC)</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>This  Corporation was established as a statutory body in New Delhi on 2nd March, 1957. Under the new Act,  the Central Warehousing Corporation was formally re-established on March 18, 1963. This  Corporation which made a modest start with seven warehouses, with 7,000 tonnes  capacity, in December 1957, had set up 458 warehouses in different places in  the country, with a total storage capacity of 78.87 lakh tones at the end of  March 2001. Of this, the present utilization is nearly 85 per cent of the total  available capacity. CWC is operating 487 Warehouses across the country with a  storage capacity of 10.6 million tonnes providing warehousing services for a  wide range of products ranging from agricultural produce to sophisticated  industrial products. Warehousing activities of CWC include food grain  warehouses, industrial warehousing, custom bonded warehouses, container freight  stations, inland clearance depots and air cargo complexes. Apart from storage  and handling, CWC also offers services in the area of clearing &amp;  forwarding, handling &amp; transportation, procurement &amp; distribution, dis  infestation services, fumigation services and other ancillary activities.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Central Warehousing Corporation provides safe and reliable storage facilities  for about 120 agricultural and industrial commodities. The areas of operations  of these central warehouses include centres of all-India and inter-state  importance.<br />
The  functions of the Central Warehousing Corporation are:<br />
(i)  To acquire and build godowns and warehouses at suitable places in India;<br />
(ii)  To run warehouses for the storage of agricultural produce, seeds, fertilizers  and notified commodities for individuals, co-operatives and other institutions;<br />
(iii)  To act as an agent of the government for the purchase, sale, storage and  distribution of the above commodities;<br />
(iv)  To arrange facilities for the transport of above commodities;<br />
(v)  To subscribe to the share capital of State Warehousing Corporations; and<br />
(vi)  To carry out such other functions as may be prescribed under the Act.<br />
While  foodgrains, sugar and fertilizers occupy 78 per cent of the total utilized  storage capacity, in the remaining 22 per cent are stored cement, chemicals and  other commodities. Warehouses of the corporation are fairly full all through  the year.<br />
            Besides the conventional storage  godowns, the Central Warehousing Corporation is running air-conditioned godowns  at Kolkatta, Mumbai and Delhi,  and provides cold storage facilities at Hyderabad.  Special storage facilities have been provided by the Central Warehousing  Corporation for the preservation of hygroscopic and fragile commodities. The  Corporation has been able to evolve a technique for a proper and scientific preservation  of jaggery during the hot and rainy seasons by selective aeration and  controlled conditions. It has set up special warehouses at some centres for the  storage of jaggery. The jaggery stored in warehouses fetches a premium price in  the market. The Corporation has also evolved techniques for the storage of  spices, coffee, seeds and other commodities.<br />
            The Corporation is operating a  number of customs bonded warehouses at important centres in Delhi, Amritsar,  Ludhiana,  Kolkata, Kandla, Ahmedabad, Baroda,  Surat, Bhopal, Cochin,  Ernakulam and Mumbai to enable exporters/importers to keep their commodities in  a good condition, pending their shipment. It has also undertaken the storage  and handling of export and import cargo at the international air-port at Palam,  New Delhi. At  this complex, all the facilities, including inspection and clearance by  customs, the payment of duty into the bank, and space for clearing agents, have  been provided by the corporation. It has put up a similar air cargo complex at Amritsar for the  export/import of goods. It has been expanding its capacity at the port towns to  serve the industry and co-operative bodies. It has already established a  sizeable capacity at Mumbai, Kolkata,   Cochin, Chennai, Mangalore,  Paradeep, Kandla, Haldia and Vizag.<br />
            The Corporation has introduced a  scheme, called the Farmers Extension Service at selected centres to educate  farmers about the benefits of a scientific storage and use of public  warehouses. The Central Warehousing Corporation also provides a package of  services, such as handling and transport, safety and security of goods;  insurance, standardization, documentation, and other connected services and  facilities.<br />
<strong>Administrative  Setup</strong><br />
            The Corporate Office is located at  &quot;WAREHOUSING BHAWAN&quot; 4/1 Siri Institutional Area, August Kranti Marg,  New Delhi - 110016. CWC has 17 Regional Offices located in major state capitals  of the country. The details of the Senior Executives is as under:</p>

  <strong>CWC’S  FORAYS INTO DEVELOPMENT OF RAILSIDE COMPLEXES</strong><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Railways has vast network for not  only operating passenger trains but also for freight movement, an imminent need  was assessed to augment the utilization level of Railway transportation system  so as to reduce the pressure on road traffic by making it cost effective and  efficient operation for the trade. As such, concept of Rail Side Warehousing  facilities was evolved by the Corporation as value addition to the rail  transport system which extends benefits to the users in avoiding multiple  handling of their stocks and resultant escapable losses on this account;  curtailing handling cost and having a hassle free efficient operation. For  transforming the concept into tangible shape, CWC successfully developed a  pilot project of Rail Side Warehousing facility at Whitefield, Bangalore in  association with South Western Railway in February 2002 and on the strength of  fruitful effect of this project on the front of increase in traffic/freight  revenue and the kind of satisfaction that trade enjoyed out of it on availing  this value added services in the arena of rail transportation, CWC and Ministry  of Railway joined their hand in the avenue of developing Rail Side Warehousing  facilities at 22 strategic locations of Railway Terminal to provide better  services through total logistic solution to Rail users for, not only to attract  additional traffic, but also to provide a cost beneficial and efficient  transport cum storage service to the trade under single window concept. <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the purview of MoU entered  between MoR and CWC, the Corporation has commenced the expansion of RWC  facilities at Whitefiled, Bangalore to meet even growing demand of users. The  Corporation has started construction of RWC facilities at Nishatpura (Bhopal) - West Central  Railway; Shakurbasti (Delhi);  Alamnagar (Lucknow);  Roza (Shahjahanpur) - all under Northern Railway and Sanathnagar (Hyderabad) - South  Central Railway after the agreements entered with respective Divisional Railway  Managers. A subsidiary in the name of &quot;Central Railside Warehouse Company  Ltd.&quot; was incorporated on 10.07.2007, under the Companies Act 1956 which  commenced its business on 24.07.2007. <br />

  <strong>(c) State Warehousing Corporations  (SWCs)</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Separate  warehousing corporations were also set up in different States of the Indian  Union. The first state warehouse was set up in Bihar  in 1956. At the end of March 2001, State Warehousing Corporations were  operating 1440 warehouses with a total capacity of over 131.38 lakh tones.<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area of operation of the State  Warehousing Corporations are centres of district importance. The total share  capital of the State Warehousing Corporations is contributed equally by the  concerned State Governments and the   Central Warehousing Corporation. The SWCs are under the dual control of  the State Government and the Central Warehousing Corporation.<br />
  <strong>Working of Warehouses</strong><br />
  <strong>            Acts:</strong> The  warehouses (CWC and SWCs) work under the respective Warehousing Acts passed by  the Central or State Governments. They are lincensed under the provisions of  the Act.<br />
                    <strong>Eligibility:</strong> Any person may  store notified commodities in a warehouse on agreeing to pay the specified  charges. The person is required to bring his produce to the warehouse for  storage. The commodity is inspected, and the quality of the product is  determined.<br />
                    <strong>Warehouse Receipt (Warrant):</strong> This is a receipt/warrant issued by the warehouse manager/owner to the person  storing his produce with them. This receipt mentions the name and location of  the warehouse, the date of issue, a description of the commodities, including  the grade, weight and approximate value of the produce based on the present  price.<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warehouse warrant is a  negotiable instrument and can be transferred by a simple endorsement and  delivery. A delivery of part of the goods may be taken through this warrant by  the depositor. Sometimes, the warrant may be non-negotiable.<br />
                    <strong>Use of Chemicals:</strong> The produce  accepted at the warehouse is preserved scientifically and protected against  rodents, insects and pests and other infestations. Periodical dusting and fumigation  are done at the cost of the warehouse in order to preserve the goods.<br />
                    <strong>Financing:</strong> The warehouse  receipt serves as a collateral security for the purpose of getting credit.  Commercial banks advance up to 75 per cent of the value of the produce stored  in the warehouse.<br />
                    <strong>Delivery of Produce:</strong> The  warehouse receipt has to be surrendered to the warehouse owner before the  withdrawal of the goods. The holder may take delivery of a part of the total  produce stored after paying the storage charges.<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main provisions of the Act  governing the grant of a license to run warehouses were:  (a) Any person, including a company, association or corporate body  may apply to the State Government for the grant of a license to carry on the  business of warehousing.<br />
                    (b) The government grants the  license after examining the warehouse building and the financial soundness of  the party, and after the realization of the prescribed fees.<br />
                    (c) The license has to be renewed  periodically on payment of prescribed fees.<br />
                    (d) The warehouse owner is  authorized to receive only notified commodities for storage in his warehouse  and issue receipts in a prescribed form.<br />
                    (e) It is the responsibility of the  warehouse owner to keep the premises clean, keep different lots of goods  separately in the warehouse, and carry on such operations as are necessary to  protect the goods against losses from damage and pilferage.</p>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considerable efforts were made to  increase the storage capacity in the country. The number of warehouses, which  had increased from only seven during 1957-58, to 306 during 1960-61, and 703  during 1970-71, went up to 1380 during 1980-81 and further to more than 2000  during 2001-02. The total capacity of warehouses which was almost negligible  during 1957-58 went up to 275 lakh tones at the end of March 2002. Out of the  total storage capacity of 275 lakh tones, nearly 89 lakh tones was with the  Central Warehousing Corporation and remaining 186 lakh tones with State  Warehousing Corporations.<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of commodities stored in  the warehouses has steadily increased. These include foodgrains, fibre crops,  fertilizer, cement, rubber, cotton yarn, textiles, paper and leather.<br />
  <strong>Food Corporation of India</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>An  efficient management of the food economy with a view to ensuring an equitable  distribution of food grains at reasonable prices to the vulnerable sections of  society is essential in the present socio-economic environment of the country.  The government felt the necessity of an organization which can act as its main  agency for handling food grains, acquire a commanding position in the food  grain trade as a countervailing force to the speculative activities of private  traders and, at the same time, work on commercial lines. Towards the end of  1964, Parliament decided to transfer the government's function of trading in  food grains to the public sector. Legislation was enacted; and the Food  Corporation of India (FCI) was born on January 1, 1965.<br />

  <strong>Functions</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  main functions of the Food Corporation of India are:<br />
                    (a) To procure a sizeable portion of  the marketable surplus of foodgrains and other agricultural commodities at  incentive prices from the farmers on behalf of the Central and State  Governments;<br />
                    (b) To make timely releases of the  stocks through the public distribution system (fair price shops and controlled  items shops) so that consumer prices may not rise unduly and unnecessarily;<br />
                    (c) To minimize seasonal price  fluctuations and inter-regional price variations in agricultural commodities by  establishing a purchasing and distribution network; and <br />
                    (d) To build up a sizeable buffer  stock of foodgrains to meet the situations that may arise as a result of  shortfalls in internal procurement and imports.<br />
  <strong>Growth and Structure</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  Corporation discharges its responsibility to the nation through a country wide  network of offices and points of contact, it is divided into five zones, each  region generally coinciding with the geographical boundary of a State. Each  region has district offices. The Corporation now has five zonal offices, 19  regional offices, four sub-regional offices, four offices of Joint Managers  (operations), 173 district offices, and thousands of operating points  throughout the country for its purchase and distribution operations.<br />
                    <strong>Organisational  Structure of FCI</strong><br />
  <center><img src="lec07_clip_image008.jpg" alt="" width="504" height="303" /></center><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  tremendous growth of the organization is the direct result of the staggering  increase in the volume of its business. The progress of the FCI in various  areas may be assessed from the following:<br />
  <strong>(i) Procurement</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  Food Corporation of India  undertakes the procurement of food grains on behalf of the Government of India  and State Governments in the States where it has been entrusted with this  responsibility either as a sole agency or jointly with other public procurement  agencies. It also undertakes massive price support operations for cereals on  behalf of the Central and State Governments to protect the interests of the  growers. It prevents distress sales by ensuring to the farmers, predetermined  procurement/support prices. It also handles huge stocks of food grains procured  by other agencies for the central pool, and utilizes the services of  co-operative societies to the maximum extent possible.<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Food Corporation of India purchases  food grains from producers during both the seasons, directly or through the  agency of co-operatives or purchasing agents, and from millers under various  arrangements of procurement determined by different State Governments. The  quantities procured in different years by the Food Corporation of India are given  in Table 7.2. A glance at the procurement of food grains by the Corporation would  show the vital and effective role it has played in the national economy.  Commercial purchases of some commodities, <em>viz</em>.,  cereals and pulses, are also made by the Corporation at market prices with a  view to supplying them to the defense services.<br />

  <strong>(ii) Storage</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  provision of adequate and proper scientific storage facilities for food grains  from the time of procurement till their distribution is another important  function performed by the Corporation. Its responsibility for storage has  increased with the transfer to it of the responsibility for building up a  buffer stock by the government. Food grains are stored in go downs which are  scientifically constructed for protection against dampness, rats and fungus.<br />
                    Till the beginning of 1968, there  had been a more or less complete ban on the construction of new go downs. With  the onset of the green revolution, there was an urgent necessity of augmenting  substantially the storage facilities for food grains at the production and  consumption centres. The Corporation, therefore, launched a crash programme for  the construction of go downs. It also encouraged private parties to construct  modern food grain go downs on a guaranteed occupation basis. Constant and  effective inspection and treatment of food grains in storage ensures that the  stocks are kept in good condition. New and cheap methods for the preservation  of stocks have been developed by the technical experts of the Corporation.  Storage losses in FCI go downs have been brought down to less than one per cent  as against its former very high percentage loss (up to 10%). The activities  undertaken by the FCI for this purpose are:<br />
                    (a) It has constructed 28.30 million  tones of storage capacity – well-built go downs, silos and CAP (Cover and  Plinth) located at strategic points near the production and consumption centres  and major ports. CAP storages are in large open areas and are scientifically  planned to hold thousands of bags of grains under polythene covers.<br />
                    (b) The FCI has taken over the  construction of silos in order to switch over to the bulk handling and storage  of food grains in a phased manner. Silos are tall and massive structures with  huge storage facilities and facilities for mechanical handling. As a result,  the losses arising out of handling are reduced. As a result, the losses arising  out of handling are reduced. Handling charges, too, are brought down. The  construction of silos has been taken up in Punjab,  Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi.<br />
                    (c) The FCI uses air strips, army  barracks and former palaces for the storage of food grains during the massive  procurement season.<br />
                    (d) The FCI has a chain of 138  quality control laboratories which develop quality control measures to ensure  the safe storage of food grains. In addition, scientists, technicians and  workers air, rotate and fumigate stocks at regular intervals so that quality  does not deteriorate.</p>

                <p><strong>(iii) Transportation</strong><br />
                  The Food Corporation of India organizes  swift and massive movement of food grains, both by rail and road, to ensure  timely arrivals in the areas of consumption and of storage. This activity of  the Corporation enables it to maintain a steady public distribution system –  from the procurement centres and the ports to the areas of consumption and  storage without any serious difficulty. It is one of the largest users of the  railways. The quantity transported by rail and road during 1966-67 was 1.238  million tones, which increased to an average of more than 20 million tones  during the last five years.<br />
  <strong>(iv) Imports</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  Food Corporation of India  handles the entire quantity of imported foodgrains at all major ports. This  responsibility was entrusted to it by the government in 1969-70. The imported  food grains are speedily dispatched to various destinations to avoid congestion  at the ports and to augment supplies to the public distribution system.<br />
  <strong>(v) Distribution</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Another  important function of the Corporation is the distribution of procured/ imported  food grains through nearly 4.91 lakh fair price shops all over India. Food  grains are issued on the basis of the allocations made by the Central  Government. The Food Corporation of India makes food grains available  to the vast majority of population at reasonable prices. The quantity of food  grains distributed through public distribution and open sales has varied  between 17.4 to 25.8 million tones during the last 5 years.</p>
                <br clear="all" />
                <p><strong>(vi) Processing</strong><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Food Corporation of India has made  notable strides in the field of food processing. It has acted as a pace-setter in  the modernization of food processing operations. It has set up 24 modern rice  mills in different States to increase the availability of rice and extract oil  from rice bran. It has also set up a Paddy Processing Research Centre at  Tiruvarur in Tamil Nadu in collaboration with the Government of Tamil Nadu and  the Union Ministry of Agriculture with a view to evolving a new technology for  increasing the outturn of rice at rice mills, better utilization of bran for  the extraction of edible oil and proper use of by products. A solvent  extraction plant at Sembanarkoil (Tamil Nadu) has also been set up for the  manufacture of edible and industrial grade oil from rice bran. These have  served as models for private interests in this line to set up such mills elsewhere.<br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation has set up paddy  dryers in Thanjavur district in Tamil Nadu and a maize dryer at Khanna in Punjab to dry the grain and transport it to other  districts without any damage by quick sprouting diseases which break out  because of high moisture content. The FCI has also set up a solvent extraction  plant at Ujjain (M.P.) to process groundnut. The FCI has set up a maize mill at  Faridabad  (Haryana) to manufacture a variety of maize products. It has set up a dal mill  at Lucknow (U.P.) to meet the purchase requirements of the army.<br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FCI also produces (about 40,000  tonnes per annum) a protein-rich food (Balahar), a midday meal for school children, Balahar is a  mix of wheat flour, groundnut meal, vitamins and minerals.<br />
  <strong>(vii) Consultancy</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  Food Corporation of India  has taken a new function of consultancy service, and provides technical and  scientific assistance to other public and private undertakings as well as  co-operatives in the country and abroad. The consultancy service offers  assistance in the modernization of rice and dal mills and other agro-processing  units. The service includes the conduct of feasibility and technoeconomic  studies, management systems and optimization studies, and market surveys.<br />
                  (viii)  The corporation also collects and manages levy sugar on behalf of the  government of India.</p>

                <p><strong>Buffer Stocking, Procurement and  Distribution of Food grains</strong><br />
                  <strong>Buffer Stocks</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  term buffer stock of food grains refer to the stock of food grains maintained  by the government to be used as a buffer to cushion the shocks of fluctuating  supply and price, to meet the emergency needs and to meet the situations  arising out of serious unexpected shortages resulting from transport  bottlenecks, natural calamities like war, flood, famine, earthquakes, and from  the influx of refugees.<br />
                  The main advantages of maintaining a  buffer stock are:<br />
                  (i) It helps in the stabilization of  prices by counteracting the effects of the activities of speculators and  hoarders;<br />
                  (ii) It safeguards the producers  against low prices, specially during the surplus-production years; and<br />
                  (iii) It imparts stability to the  country's food economy.<br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government enters the market and  purchases food grains for the maintenance of the buffer stock. This buffer  stock can be built either by internal purchases or by imports from foreign  countries. It is maintained by the Food Corporation of India and has  averaged more than 10 million tones annually since 1976, as against a normal  stock of less than 5 per cent tones before that year. After 5 years of a very  comfortable position in food grains, the year 1981 witnessed some tightening in  the supply position. The all-time record off take of 14.9 million tones in  1980, the relatively low procurement of 11.2 million tones, and the estimated  exports of 2 million tones of food grains in repayment of a wheat loan led to a  sharp decline in the size of stocks. The procurement of wheat boosted the food  grains stocks to 13.5 million tones by the end of July 1981. These stocks,  though adequate, were well below the level during the five years from 1976 to  1980.<br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mid-eighties, a buffer stock of  10 million tones comprising 5 million tones of wheat and equal quantity of rice  was considered adequate. It should be noted that this buffer stock is over and  above the operational stocks. Considering both together, a stock of around 20  million tones was considered necessary for a country of India's size.  However, the stock, which can be considered optimum, depends on the level of  public distribution of food grains intended by the government. On July 1, 1990, the food rains  stock with the government of India  was 20.3 million tones. But on the same day, a year before (July 1, 1980), the stock was  only around 13 million tones.</p>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart  from CWC and SWCs, the Food Corporation of India has also created storage  facilities. The Food Corporation of India has a storage capacity of 21  million tones. Most of the capacity is of covered type which include  conventional but scientifically designed godowns and silo complexes but a part  of the storage capacity is of covered and plinth (CAP) type. The CAP storage  capacity consists of cemented floor as the base and tarpaulins or other similar  sheets as the cover (Table 7.3). <br />

              <p><strong> (c)  Co-operative Sector</strong><br />
                <strong>            </strong>The  co-operative sector has also built a storage capacity of 13.55 million tones up  to March 2002. The co-operatives have also constructed 175 cold storage  warehouses with a total capacity of 2.14 lakh tones. The National Co-operative  Development Corporation had helped in contracting 55988 rural godowns and 9363  cooperative marketing godowns by the end of March, 2002. These co-operative  godowns are used by the Food Corporation of India in times of need, and provide  a readily available cushion when the procurement of foodgrains is at peak.<br />
            The spatial distribution of CWC,  SWC, FCI and Cooperative marketing societies godowns constructed in the country  is uneven across states with relatively poor storage facilities in the eastern  states of the country. The available storage facility is also poor in the hilly  and desert areas.<br />

              <p><strong>(d)</strong> <strong>Total Storage Capacity in India</strong><br />
                <strong>            </strong>There  are three main agencies, which are involved in the creation of storage facility  in the public sector in the country <em>viz</em>.,  Food Corporation of India, Central Warehousing Corporation and State  Warehousing Corporations. Cooperative Marketing Societies also provide storage  facilities at the primary marketing level. Recently rural godowns have also  been constructed in rural areas under the Gramin Bhandaran Yojana initiated by  the Government of India.<br />
                Total storage capacity available in India is shown  in Table 4.14.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total storage capacity available in  the country in 1969 was only 10.9 million tones. This has increased in 70.1  million tones in 2000-01. However, this is considerably short of the  requirements. The available storage capacity is sufficient only for 30 per cent  of total foodgrains production provided cent per cent of the available capacity  is utilized only for the storage of foodgrains. Private sector has also created  facilities for storage of agricultural commodities nearby their place of  business but most of these storage structures are unscientific and are located  in the congested lanes of cities/towns. Union Budget 2010 of India announced  that deficit in the storage capacity would be met through an ongoing scheme  for private sector participation – FCI to hire godowns from private parties for  a guaranteed period of 7 years.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storage plan of the Ministry aims at providing the  capacity required for buffer and operational stock of food grains to maintain  the public distribution system and general warehousing.. The Board approach is  to provide scientific storage capacity and reduce dependence on the capacity  under cover and plinth. The Ministry has also been making efforts to improve  the traditional storage practices in vogue at the farm level.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food grain Storage and General Warehousing there are  three agencies in the public sector which are engaged in building large scale  storage/warehousing capacity namely. Food Corporation of India (FCI)  Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and 17 State Warehousing Corporation  (SWCs). Over a period of time sizeable scientific storage/warehousing capacity  has been developed by these public sector agencies and they are implementing  plans to increase it further. While the capacity available with FCI is used  mainly for storage of food grains that with CWC and SWCs is used for storage of  food grains as well as certain other items. </p>

<p><strong>Utilization of Warehousing Capacity</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  utilization of warehousing capacity of the Central Warehousing Corporation was  only 42 per cent in 1959-60, which increased over time to 96 per cent in  1970-71. The utilization of the capacity of State Warehousing Corporations  increased from 64 per cent in 1960-61 to 75 per cent in 1968-69. At present,  about 85 per cent of their storage capacity is being utilized. Of the total  storage capacity with CWC, 57 per cent is utilized for foodgrains, seven per  cent for fertilizers and 36 per cent for other purposes. But the available  storage capacity, is mostly utilized by traders or public agencies. A study has  indicated that only 29 per cent of the warehousing capacity of the Central  Warehousing Corporation and six per cent of that of State Warehousing  Corporations was utilized by farmers or their cooperatives.<br />
  The main reasons for the very low  utilization of warehouses by farmers are:<br />
  1.  Lack of knowledge about the facility of warehousing available for the farmers;<br />
  2.  Locational disadvantages for warehouses to most of the cultivators located in  villages;<br />
  3.  Complicated and time-consuming procedure of depositing and withdrawing the  produce from the warehouses;<br />
  4.  Non-existence of nationalized banks in villages and the problem of arranging  finance at the time of taking delivery of the receipt from the bank; and<br />
  5.  Small quantity of surplus produce available with most farmers, and the pressing  need for finance.<br />
  These  apart, there are some fundamental factors responsible for lower use of  warehouses and consequent slow progress in rural areas.<br />
  <strong>Causes of slow progress</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  following are the main causes of the slow progress of warehousing in the  agricultural sector in India:<br />
  (i) Indian farmers are small  landowners. Obviously, the marketed surplus available with them in small.  Often, it is not worthwhile for them to store the produce in a warehouse;<br />
  (ii) Indian agriculture is largely  dependent on the monsoon and occasional failures of crops in one or another  part of the country are common resulting in lack of regular business for the  warehousing;<br />
  (iii) Agricultural products are more  perishable than industrial products;<br />
  (iv) Agricultural commodities are  heterogeneous. Their grading is, therefore, essential before placing them in a  warehouse. This facility is not available in most of the markets;<br />
  (v) The warehouses are located in  urban centres, near railway stations and big cities. The transport facility  from the villages to these centres is not easily available;<br />
  (vi) The cost of warehousing per  unit of the produce is high;<br />
  (vii) Warehouse receipts are papers  having no intrinsic value, unless the lenders are sure that these receipts are  backed by tangible assets. Often, the lenders are not interested in lending  against this collateral security.<br />
  In this context, it must be  recognized that storage of the produce is at a cost. It is not only the charges  of the warehouse that are to be paid but also the interest on the value of the  produce and the premium for risk of a lower price at a later date are to be  met. With the prevailing rate of interest, the interest component of the  storage cost is no less significant. Moreover, the intra-year price rise may  not cover the entire cost of storage every year. The probability of returns  from storage being positive is not one. This means that the gains from storage  depend on the decision on the timing of the purchase and sale. This necessitates  acumen of astute trading, which every farmer does not possess. This apart,  farmers in surplus-producing states like Punjab and Haryana sell their produce  at the minimum support price to the public agencies and as the minimum support  price remains the same till the next harvest season, such farmers do not gain  by storing the produce, unless open market prices in the lean season rise to  such levels as to cover the cost of storage and still leave a margin as an  incentive to store, which rarely happens. The worry on low utilization of  warehouses by the farmers should be seen in this light. Even if the facility is  utilized by the traders, it indirectly helps the farmers by way of augmenting  the demand for commodities stored by the traders.<br />
  <strong>Suggestions</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  projected availability of food grains and the currently available storage  capacity in India  show that there is big gap in storage capacity. This gap has to be bridged as  early as possible if advantage is to be taken of the benefits of increased  agricultural production. The Union Government, therefore, constituted a Working  Group on Warehousing to go into this question. The Working Group, in its report  submitted to the Ministry of Agriculture made the following recommendations:<br />
  (i) A network of rural storage centres  should be built on a priority basis in order to prevent distress sales, wastage  and loss arising out of inadequate and defective storage facilities;<br />
  (ii) These storage centres may be  constructed and managed by panchayats, co-operatives and other suitable  agencies selected by the State Government;<br />
  (iii) These centres may have a  storage capacity of 100 to 250 tonnes, mainly for foodgrains and other  agricultural produce;<br />
  (iv) The cost of the construction of  these structures, may be met by a 50 per cent subsidy and 50 per cent bank  loans. Out of the subsidy part, 35 per cent may be borne by the Central  Government and 15 per cent by the State Government.<br />
  (v) Each rural storage centre should  have a manager, preferably from the area served by the centre. The manager  should be trained in the basic essentials of warehousing by attaching him to a  warehouse of the CWC or SWC;<br />
  (vi) Technical guidance, supervision  and assistance in the design, construction and management of the centres should  be provided by the CWC/SWC free of charge, or at a nominal charge;<br />
  (vii) Farmers should be provided  with receipts for the commodities stored by them. Each receipt should be a  negotiable instrument to enable them to obtain credit from banks;<br />
  (viii) The banks should provide  credit to the extent of 90 per cent of the value of the stocks stored by the  farmers; and the credit should be provided at concessional rates of interest;<br />
  (ix) The scheme of rural storage  centres should be linked with the procurement machinery for foodgrains and also  with the public distribution system, and<br />
  (x) The programme should be  co-ordinated by a state level co-ordination committee, of which representatives  of State Governments, the department of agriculture, rural development,  co-operation and panchayats, the SWC, FCI and nationalized banks, should be the  serving members.<br />
  However, it must be recognized that  the success of the warehousing scheme depends on winning the confidence of the  depositors and making people at all levels aware of the intrinsic merits of  warehousing. Steps taken by the Government of India to overcome the problems in  marketing of agricultural commodities include the following among others. <br />
  Provide project import status with a concessional  import duty of 5 per cent for the setting up of mechanised handling systems and  pallet racking systems in &lsquo;mandis&rsquo; or warehouses for food grains and sugar as  well as full exemption from service tax for the installation and commissioning  of such equipment.<br />
  Provide project import status at a concessional  customs duty of 5 per cent with full exemption from service tax to the initial  setting up and expansion of ♦Cold storage, cold room  including farm pre-coolers for preservation or storage of agriculture and  related sectors produce ; and Processing units for such produce.<br />
  Provide full exemption from customs duty to  refrigeration units required for the manufacture of refrigerated vans or  trucks.<br />
  Provide concessional customs duty of 5 per cent  to specified agricultural machinery not manufactured in India;<br />
  Provide central excise exemption to specified  equipment for preservation, storage and processing of agriculture and related  sectors and exemption from service tax to the storage and warehousing of their  produce; and<br />
  <strong>Cold Storages</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  term cold storage refers to a refrigerated chamber for the storage of such  perishable commodities as fruits, vegetables, fish, eggs, meat, dairy products,  etc: In these storage structures, the temperature is controlled and maintained  so that the stored perishable products may not deteriorate in quality. In a  cold storage, the temperature is maintained in the range of -1.1oC  to 10oC (30o to 50oF). The other form of cold  storage is the freezer storage, in which the temperature is kept below 1.1oC  (30oF), and the product remains in a frozen state.<br />
  In addition to the preservation of  the quality of perishable products, the cold storage offers the following  advantages:<br />
  (i) It makes possible the even  placement of perishable commodities in the market. This would not have been  possible without the cold storage facility.<br />
  (ii) It helps in the price  stabilization of perishable commodities by removing the gluts occurring in the  production season.<br />
  (iii) It helps in widening the  market for the products, lowering marketing costs, raising the price realized  by the producer and lowering the price to consumers, and ensures that products  are available throughout the year.<br />
  (iv) Cold storage facilities have  made it possible for consumer to live in greater comfort.<br />
  Till recently, the establishment of  cold storage industry remained under regulation. The Central Government issued  Cold storage Order in 1964 and later in 1980. However, some State Governments  like that in West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana were permitted to promulgate their own  orders. The Cold Storage Order was promulgated by the Government of India under  Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. It was being administered by  the Directorate of Marketing and Inspection to achieve the following objectives:<br />
  (i) To ensure hygienic and proper  refrigeration conditions in the cold storage;<br />
  (ii) To regulate the growth of the  cold storage industry in a planned manner;<br />
  (iii) To render technical guidance  for scientific preservation of foodstuffs; and<br />
  (iv) To safeguard the interests of  farmers and other depositors.<br />
  Cold Storage Order, 1964 and also of  1980 was applicable all over the country except in the States of Uttar Pradesh,  West Bengal, Punjab and Haryana, where the State Governments have enacted their  own Cold Storage Acts. West Bengal and Uttar  Pradesh sought permission to enact their own Acts in 1960 and 1975. Punjab and Haryana Governments were permitted to  promulgate their own State orders for regulating the cold storage industry in  1979.<br />
  Under the Cold Storage Order, the  prospective entrepreneur was required to obtain the permission from the  Agricultural Marketing Advisor to the Government of India for construction of a  cold storage. With effect from 1st   January, 1965, it was obligatory for a cold storage, with a  capacity exceeding 8.50 cubic metres to obtain a licence before storing any  foodstuff. The Agricultural Marketing Advisor to the Government of India was  the authority under the Cold Storage Order, and it is he who is empowered to  licence the setting up of a cold storage.<br />
  The Cold Storage Order, 1980 was  rescinded in May, 1997. The repeal of the cold storage order of 1980 aimed at  enabling the government in the removal of licensing, price control and  requisitioning of the cold storage space with a view to allowing the  functioning of free marketing mechanism for demand based growth of cold storage  industry in the country free from all kinds of administrative interference.<br />
  Most of the cold storages are in the  private sector. The National Commission on Agriculture in 1976 had recommended  for adequate measures to be taken by co-operatives and public sector  undertakings to provide cold storage facilities in production areas and  terminal markets. As a follow-up, the National Cooperative Development  Corporation prepared a project for setting up 4.8 lakh tones of cold storage  capacity in the co-operative sector by 1985 with the World Bank assistance in  the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh.<br />
  The first cold storage was established  in India  as early as in 1892 at Kolkata. But noticeable progress in expansion of the  cold storage industry was not made until 1947. Even up to 1955, the total cold  storage capacity in the country was only 0.771 lakhs tones. The number of cold  storage units and their capacity in India are given in Table 7.7. </p>

  The  rapid strides in the expansion of cold storage capacity were made after 1955.  The cold storage capacity increased to 3.055 lakh tones in 1960, 16.38 lakh  tones in 1970, 39.65 lakh tones in 1980, 68.15 lakh tones in 1990 and further  to 153.85 lakh tones in 2001. The total number of cold storage units in the  country in 1996 has been 3253, which increased to 4199 in 2001. There is a wide  inter-state variation in the availability of cold storage facilities in India.<br />

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Potato  is the main product which is stored in the cold storage. Out of the total  capacity utilization, 88 per cent is used for storing potato. Commodity-wise  utilization of cold storage units in India can be seen in Table 7.9.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The  construction of a cold storage requires heavy investment in terms of building  and machines. Similarly, to run the cold store, the cost on electricity input  is very high and it amounts to 50 per cent of total running or variable cost.  As such there is need to develop low cost and energy saving cold storage units.<br />

</center><br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For  promotion of cold storage units in the private sector to meet their increasing  needs, a capital investment subsidy scheme for construction/expansion/modernization of cold storages/storages for  horticultural produce has been initiated by Government of India. This scheme is  implemented by National Horticulture Board. Under this scheme, the promoters of  cold storage units are provided 25% back-ended capital investment subsidy, 50%  is provided as term loan and 25% is promoter's contribution. The proposals are  considered and sanctioned by National Cooperative Development Corporation  (NCDC) under cooperative sector. This scheme is implemented in those  States/Union Territories, which do not control rentals for cold storages under  any statutory or administrative order.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The available capacity of cold  storage is much less than the country's requirements. It is barely sufficient  for 15 per cent of potato production and for less than one per cent of fruits,  vegetables and fish production. The cold storage requirement has further  increased in view of the need to promote exports of processed foods.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is a considerable scope for  expansion of the cold storage industry in India. However, due to large capital  requirements, lack of proper technical guidance, inadequate and fluctuating  power supply and lack of appreciation for stored products, the entrepreneurs  are not attracted to establish cold storage units. The lack of cold storage  facilities is leading to heavy losses and violent fluctuations in prices of  fruits and vegetables. There is a need to encourage cold storage industry in  several regions of the producing areas as well as in large urban centres.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In India, the production patterns,  dietary habits and economic considerations warrant long period of storage in  large quantities of onion and potato. The conditions required for the storage  of potato and onions are distinctly different. While the potato requires low  temperature and high relative humidity, onions require low temperature and low  relative humidity. Most of the cold storages in the country meet the storage  requirements of these two vegetables. For other vegetables, temporary storage  structures for short period usually not exceed a week are needed along the  route of their movement from producing areas to consuming centres.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As per the estimates of the Expert  Committee on Strengthening and Developing of Agricultural Marketing (Government  of India, June 2001), there is a need for construction of 15000 cold storage  units with 45 lakhs tones capacity in the next ten years for storage of  increased output of horticultural products. There is also need for  technological upgradation for cost effective refrigeration machinery and  improvement in the methods of scientific preservation of perishable  commodities.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The country would also need reefer  containers/vans for transport of perishable commodities for domestic and export  marketing. Their availability was nil in fifties but increased in recent years  to 400. During the next 10 years, it is estimated that atleast 3000 reefer  containers/vans each of 8 tonnes capacity would be needed to handle the  available surplus of perishable agricultural products (Government of India,  June 2001).<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Considering the fact that an average  farmer may not need and have access to mechanical refrigerated cold stores;  ventilated storages like direct evaporation cooled structures; energy cool  chambers; cool homes and forced evaporation cool stores have been developed.  These structures provide relatively lower temperature and high humidity as  compared to ambient conditions because of natural/forced evaporative cooling.  These can be constructed with locally available materials. The zero energy cool  home, AADF CIP design cool home and two-tier structures can be afforded by the  farmers on their farms. However, other improved structures can be constructed  by growers co-operatives or owners of large size farms.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Associated Chamber of Commerce  and Industry (Assocham), highest body of the Chambers of Commerce of India  (CCI), providing a forum for dialogue between business and government said in  its report &ldquo;Food Processing and Agri Business&rdquo; that the country is short by 10  million tonnes of cold storage capacity due to which about 30- 40% of agricultural  produce goes waste every year. The report is jointly prepared by Assocham and  international advisory company – KPMG.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to Assocham&rsquo;s latest study  report, against a requirement of over 31 million tonnes of cold storage, India  has a capacity of nearly 21.7 million tonnes, leading to a loss of about 40% of  the agri-produce post harvest. About the new study on cold storages S Jindal, president – Assocham, said, &ldquo;Cold storage  facilities now available are mostly for single commodity like potato, orange,  apple, grapes, pomegranate and flowers, resulting in poor capacity utilisation.  Long and fragmented supply chain in India along with inefficiencies lead to  huge losses due to wastage or shrinkage of perishable commodities.&rdquo; The  industry body has also asked the government to build new cold chain  infrastructure to increase its storage capacity.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At present, the Indian cold chain  market is worth $2.6 billion. This market is expected to grow to $12.4 billion  by 2015. Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have  65% of the total installed capacity of cold storage in the country. Cold chains  are used primarily for fruits and vegetables, meat and marine products,  floriculture, dairy products, ice creams and confectionery. Further, the report  said that entire supply chain in the country is dominated by unorganised  players with several intermediaries adding to wastage from farm to consumer via  retailer, processor or exporter. In a long supply chain, one level is unaware  of requirements of next level, leading to disconnection between farmer and  processor. Secondly, absence of any structured market hampers discovery of  correct price and availability of consistent quality of produce.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;India  is losing food items worth a whopping Rs 50,000 crore (Rs 500 billion) every  year due to poor post-harvest handling of farm produce, a development that  analysts say may jeopardise the Centre&rsquo;s plan to formulate a food security law,  especially in view of a &ldquo;below-normal&rdquo; monsoon. &ldquo;The level of wastage of  agricultural food items is estimated to be about Rs 50,000 crore (a year),  occurring at various stages of handling after harvesting,&rdquo; food processing  minister Subodh Kant Sahai said in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Identifying the need for food safety  and quality, the Ministry of Food Processing Industry, Government of India, has  earmarked Rs 250 crore towards the sector under the 11th Five-Year Plan.  Deliberating in the oneday seminar on &lsquo;Sensitizing Programme on Food Safety  Systems,&rsquo; organised by the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII), K  Rajeshwara Rao, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Food Processing Industries said,  &ldquo;it is vital to sensitize masses about important aspects of protecting  themselves against foodborne diseases.&rsquo;&rsquo; Sharing details about a scheme  implemented by the Central Government in assoication with CII, NGOs and  municipal bodies to improve food safety in the streets, Rao said, &ldquo;this scheme  lays down standards, quality upgradation and capacity building of street food  vendors in about 50 cities across the country through microfinance linkages.&rsquo;&rsquo;<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Safe farm produce could be unfit  for human consumption during transportation, storage, packaging, food  preparation in kitchens, if handled unhygienically,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Utpal Sen Gupta,  chairman, CII AP chapter and vice chairman, Agrotech Foods Limited.<br />
