				<p>One  of the responsibilities of the government is to ensure the supply of essential  commodities to the people. This may require direct intervention on its part in  trading of agricultural commodities.<br />
                  <strong>Objectives</strong> <br />
            The objectives of state trading are:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>To make available supplies of essential  commodities to consumers at reasonable prices on a regular basis;</li>
                  <li>To  ensure a fair price of the produce to the farmers so that there may be an  adequate incentive to increase production;</li>
                  <li>To  minimize violent price fluctuations occurring as a result of seasonal  variations in supply and demand;</li>
                  <li>To  arrange for the supply of such inputs as fertilizers and insecticides so that  the tempo of increased production is maintained;</li>
                  <li>To  undertake the procurement and maintenance of buffer stock, and their  distribution, whenever and wherever necessary;</li>
                  <li>To  arrange for storage, transportation, packaging and processing;</li>
                  <li>To  conduct surveys and provide the required statistics to the government so that  it may improve the conditions of the farmers; and</li>
                  <li>To  check hoarding, black-marketing and profiteering.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Types of State Trading</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>State  trading may be partial or complete, depending upon the extent of intervention  desired by the government.<br />
                  <strong>(i) Partial State Trading</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>In  partial state trading, private traders and government coexist. Traders are free  to buy and sell in the market. The government may place some restrictions on  them, such as declaration of stocks, limits on the stocks which can be held at  a point of time and submission of regular accounts. The government enters the  market for the purchase of commodities directly from producers at notified  procurement price. It undertakes the distribution of commodities to consumers  through a network of fair price shops. In this way, it safeguards the interest  of producers and consumers alike, and keeps a check on the undesirable  activities of traders.<br />
                  <strong>(ii) Complete State Trading</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>This  is the extreme form of trading adopted by the government when partial state  trading fails to ensure fair prices to producers and make goods available to  consumers at reasonable prices. The purchase and sale of commodities is  undertaken entirely by the government or its agencies. Private traders are not  allowed to enter the market for purchase or sale. Under this form of state  trading, the government remains the sole purchaser and distributor of the  commodity.<br />
                  Complete state trading necessitates  the outlay of huge finance, and the provision of storage facilities at  important production and consumption centres, and calls for appointment of  efficient men so that the purchase and distribution functions of professional  traders may be effectively taken over by a governmental agency. In India,  complete wholesale trade in wheat was taken over by the government in 1973; but  it had to be given up very soon.<br />
  <strong>Experience of Wholesale Trade Takeover  in Wheat</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>On  the recommendation of Chief Ministers' conference held in February, 1973, the  wholesale trade in wheat and paddy was taken over by the government from the  rabi season of 1972-73. It was intended to eliminate the wholesalers, who were  considered to be responsible for creating an artificial scarcity by hoarding  with a view to raising prices. It was expected that the direct purchase of  foodgrains by the government and their subsequent objectives of the complete  takeover of wholesale trade were to:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Eliminate unwarranted profits of middlemen;</li>
                  <li>Ensure  remunerative prices to producers;</li>
                  <li>Guarantee  an assured supply of foodgrains to consumers at reasonable prices;</li>
                  <li>Arrest  the price rise; and</li>
                  <li>Excise  effective public control over the marketable surplus of agricultural  commodities – an item of essential necessity for the masses.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>            Under the wholesale trade takeover  scheme, public sector agencies like the Food Corporation of India, the Civil  Supply Departments of State Governments and Co-operative Marketing Societies  were entrusted with the responsibility of purchasing the marketed surplus and  its subsequent disposal to consumers through a network of fair price shops.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme of wholesale trade  takeover in wheat did not succeed, and was withdrawn immediately. It was  planned to purchase 30 to 35 per cent of the total production of wheat in the  country during that year; but government agencies could procure only half of  the targeted quantity of 8.5 million tones of wheat. The reasons of the failure  of the scheme were:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Very low procurement prices, i.e., Rs.76 per  quintal;</li>
                  <li>Coaxing  farmers by disgruntled traders. Traders were the main sufferers when this  scheme was introduced; and they undermined the arrivals of wheat in the market;</li>
                  <li>Over-estimation  of the marketable surplus in various States;</li>
                  <li>Inconvenient  public purchase system resulting in a long wait by farmers for many hours, and  sometimes for more than one day for their turn to hand over the produce and get  payment for it. Farmers had to travel long distances to sell their produce at  official depots;</li>
                  <li>Skewed  distribution of marketed surplus in favour of big farmers, who have retention  power;</li>
                  <li>Slackness  on the part of State Governments in implementing the policy because of lack of  sufficient and experienced staff capable of handling the work; and </li>
                  <li>Lack  of storage facilities with the government for storing the procured foodgrains.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  government realized that takeover of rice trade would be much more difficult  than wheat trade due to its operation on a wide area in the country and also  due to the existence of surplus regions within deficit states. Hence government  gave away the complete wholesale trade takeover. However, partial state trading  has continued mainly through Food Corporation of India and National  Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation.<br />
                  <strong>EXPORTS FROM INDIA </strong><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STC  exports a diverse range of items to a number of destinations throughout the  world.

Imports are  undertaken against the firm advance indents of the prospective buyers. STC  invites offers for the indented oils, negotiates the best possible terms and  finalises the deal with the consent of the buyers as per their requirement. The  entire operation is based on actual costs plus a fixed service margin charged  by STC. Various components of actual cost are generally as under.CIF cost of  the goods. <br />

                  Delivery period : generally 30 days from the date of  arrival/PHO clearance of the oil. <br />
  <strong>Payment mechanism</strong><br />
                  (a) STC makes payment to the foreign supplier  against sight LC.<br />
                  (b) Domestic buyers are required to make payment  prior to taking delivery. <br />
                  (c) Credit facility to the buyer is available upto  120 days against internal LC/co-accepted Bill of Exchange by the reputed bank.  STC charges interest on funds deployed at the cash credit rate plus 1% per  annum basis (currently 12.50% p.a.) <br />

  <strong>Quality Control in Agricultural Products</strong><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality control of agricultural  commodities is the responsibility of the Directorate of Marketing and  Inspection. The Directorate has prescribed grade standards for various  agricultural products under the Agricultural Produce Grading and Marking Act,  1937. Agricultural commodities are graded under this Act on the basis of the  specifications laid down under the grade standards. Graded products bear the  AGMARK label, indicating the purity and quality of the product. Consumers are  benefited when they buy graded products. The details of the mechanics of grade  standards for agricultural products and the progress of grading in India have  been discussed in Chapter 4.<br />
  <strong>Manufactured Products</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Manufactured  products are graded in accordance with the standards laid down by the Indian  Standards Institution, now Bureau of Indian Standards and bear the ISI label.  Manufacturers have to use proper ingredients in specified proportions and  follow the technique of manufacture given in the standards laid down by the  Indian Standards Institution. The ISI label is an indicator of the good quality  of the product.<br />
  <strong>Indian Standards Institution (ISI)</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Standardization  on an organized basis started in India with the establishment of the Indian  Standards Institution. The Institution, popularly known as the ISI; was set up  in 1947 with the active support of the industrial, scientific and technical  organizations in the country. The ISI frames standards in consultation with,  and as a result of the co-operation of, the community – industrialists,  scientists, administrators and the public. Standardization plays a vital role  in the industrial development of a country. Apart from helping the commercial  movement and industrial exchanges, standards conserve the production effort by  reducing costs and making mass production possible. Thus, standards lead to the  best utilization of the human and material resources of a country. The  institution operates under an Act of Parliament (ISI Certification Marks Act),  under which manufactured items are stamped with the ISI mark of certification.  This mark acts as a third party guarantee to the purchaser that the goods  bearing the ISI mark have been produced in accordance with the provisions of  the relevant Indian standards.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Standards Day is  celebrated annually on 14th October, for it was on this day in 1946  that the United Nations Co-ordinating Committees decided to set up the  International Organization for Standardization. This international organization  now has one lakh experts from 82 countries directly involved in its work, and  help it to create more and better international standards.<br />
                  The aims and objects of the ISI are:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Preparation of standards for products,  commodities, materials and processes on national and international bases;</li>
                  <li>Promotion  of the general adoption of the standards prepared by it at national and  international levels;</li>
                  <li>Certification  of industrial products and assistance in the production of quality goods;</li>
                  <li>Dissemination  of information relating to standards and standardization;</li>
                  <li>Conduct  of surveys and training programmes for assistance to Indian industries in  organizing their in-plant standards activity;</li>
                  <li>Collaboration  with international organizations dealing with standardization for promotion of  international trade;</li>
                  <li>Imparting  training in industrial standardization to scientists and technologists from  abroad; and</li>
                  <li>Performing  a watching function in regard to the quality of Indian exports. The Export  Inspection Council exempts certain products, such as light engineering  products, diesel engines and power-driven pumps, from preshipment inspection if  they carry the ISI mark.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Indian Standards Institution functions through nine Divisional Councils, which  are responsible for the work of standardization in their respective fields.  These divisional councils are; agricultural and food products, chemical, civil  engineering, consumer products, electro-technical, mechanical engineering,  structurals and metals, textiles and cargo movements, marine products and  packaging.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ISI has set up about 2,000 technical  committees, sub-committees and panels dealing with different subjects with a  membership of more than 24,000 experts representing various interests such as  manufacturers, purchasers, consumers, scientific, technical and research  organizations and government departments. These experts work in an honorary  capacity and evolve national standards by consensus. Each standard  specification is finalized after an exhaustive process of testing in  laboratories, discussion in the committees and circulation to hundreds of  interested parties all over the country.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formulation of standards through  consensus of different interests concerned generally ensures their smooth  implementation. In addition, Central and State Governments; local bodies and  statutory organizations generally adopt standards in their purchases. Some  State Governments decided to give preference to ISI certified products while  some others have established standards cell for effective implementation of  Indian Standards.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ISI also uses different media of  public relations and publicity to spread the message of standardization. As a  result, more than 90 per cent of Indian Standards have been adopted by various  official and non-official organizations. Various promotional and instructional  programmes are carried out. The promotional programmes include management  conferences and group meetings. The instructional programmes comprise survey,  training programmes and seminars.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For effective implementation of  national standards and for bringing the advantages of standardization within  the reach of the common consumer, the institution is operating a certification  marks scheme under the ISI (Certification Marks) Act. This Act enables ISI to  grant licences to manufactures to use the ISI mark on their products. Every  licence includes a scheme of testing and inspection which the licencee is  required to follow strictly. During the operation of the licence, ISI carries  out regular and surprise inspections of the manufactures to make sure that the  scheme of testing and inspection is being properly adhered to. Samples of  certified products are drawn from the production line and from the open market  and tested in independent laboratories. As a safeguard for the consumer the  scheme provides for free replacement of ISI marked goods found to be of  substandard quality.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certification scheme was started  in 1955-56. The licencee covers a range of 570 products including consumer  products and industrial items such as biscuits, infant milk food, ink, cables,  conductors, jute products, steel, paints, shoe polish, pressure cookers,  aluminium utensils, coffee, electrical appliances, sports goods and water  meters. In the rural sector, the ISI has formulated standards for grain storage  structures, fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, farm machinery and implements,  pumping sets, gobar gas plants and animal husbandry and dairy equipments. Some  items in the market, however, do not conform to these standards because they  are produced in the small and tiny sectors without any facility or funds for  quality testing.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For adoption of national standards  to regulate the quality of industrial manufactures, in-plant standardization is  an important requirement. Since 1961, ISI has promoted the concept of in-plant  standardization through conferences, symposia and training programmes.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The institution has established a  central laboratory at New Delhi and regional laboratories in Mumbai, Kolkata  and Chennai for conducting testing of products covered under the certification  marks scheme. These laboratories also undertake investigational work covering  food, chemical, electrical and mechanical items for the purposed of evaluation  of standards. Laboratory personnel from government agencies and industries  covering their products under the ISI certification marks scheme avail of the  training facilities provided by the Institution in its laboratories.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ISI serves the interests of the  country in the field of international standardization by close collaboration  with the international organizations such as ISO (International Organization  for Standardization) and the IEC (International Electro Technical Commission)  for standardization. It is represented on important administrative bodies of  these organizations.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ISI also works in close  collaboration with the similar organizations for standardization in other  countries of the ECAFE (Economic Commission for Asia and Far East) Region with  a view to promoting standardization activities. It actively participates in the  work of the Asian Standards Advisory Committee (ASAC).<br />
                  The ISI has benefited the consumers  as well as the manufacturers. It promotes overall economy and brings about the  best utilization of human and material resources by bringing the advantages –  minimization of wastages, cutting down unnecessary varieties of products,  increasing productivity and reducing costs. It protects the consumers through  assured quality. It acts as a third party guarantee. The scheme brings to the  consumers the benefits of lower price, better quality, more safety and repair  services. To manufactures, it helps in adopting, the process of  standardization. This reduces wastage, cost of material, cost of production and  increases the chances of profits. It has introduced the metric system of  weights and measures. The ISI took up the steel economy project involving a  comprehensive standardization programme to give a fillip to the steel industry  and introduce economies in the use of structural and special alloy steels. The  project resulted in a saving of 24 per cent in the use of metal according to an  evaluation by NCAER. Another notable achievement is the preparation of the  National Building Code streamlining housing construction practices all over the  country.</p>
                <p><strong>Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  Indian standards Institution has been renamed as the Bureau of Indian Standards  (BIS) with effect from April 1, 1987. Along with the change in its name, its  status and scope of activities have also been enlarged. The Bureau of Indian  Standards carry on all the functions of ISI as before with greater thrust to  consumer protection, improving the level of quality of Indian products,  harmonizing the standards formulation and the certification/inspection  activities in the country by providing a larger network of testing and  consultancy services.<br />
            The Bureau has been established by  the Bureau of Indian Standards Act, 1986 and has become a statutory body. As  such all the activities of the Bureau <em>viz</em>.,  standards formulation, product certification, quality assurance, consultancy  services, quality assessment, testing and development of test methods have  assumed statutory status. The ISI was a registered society and statutory powers  were confined to it only in respect of the operation of the certification marks  activity.<br />
            Over the past five decades, it has  built up over 17,000 Indian Standards covering products in different sectors  like food and agriculture, chemicals, civil, mechanical and electrical  engineering, electronics, textiles and many other products. The standards are  constantly reviewed and updated to keep pace with technological innovations and  the new social needs. The production of small-scale items based on Indian  standards provides competitive capability with large-scale sector.<br />
            The Bureau has also made special  efforts in the sphere of rural development by formulating over 2,000 standards  relevant to the rural sector in areas of agricultural inputs like fertilizers,  pesticides, agricultural machinery and farm implements, pumping sets, gobar gas  plants and also in the sphere of post-harvest technology. The BIS has also  formulated three standards for water.<br />
            The Bureau is one of the largest  certification agencies with over 11,000 licences in operation for a wide range  of products. It has become an institution of quality assurance for the  consumers.<br />
            Standards certification is mandatory  for items of mass consumption particularly those affecting health and safety of  the consumers. Provision of voluntary certification for items such as colour  television, control switches, sodium vapour lamps, jute and canvas products,  bus and truck tyres and greases also exists.<br />
            Some of the latest highlights of BIS  activities are:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>BIS has adopted IS/ISO 9000 series of  standards. Now BIS quality certification is on the lines of international norms  and is accredited by RVA Neitherlands.</li>
                  <li>With  growing concern for environmental friendly industrial activity, BIS has started  ISO 14001 EMS Certification.</li>
                  <li>BIS  is also undertaking HACCP certification. HACCP Certification is a process  control system designed to prevent microbial and other hazards in food  production. It is based on Quality Management System and IS 15000 which is  equivalent to CODEX ALI NORM 97/13A.</li>
                  <li>BIS  also works as central enquiry point for WTO.</li>
                  <li>BIS  has so far formulated more than 17000 standards.</li>
                  <li>BIS  has also formulated three Indian standards for water.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Consumer Protection</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Food  products have the distinction of meeting an essential need of all the  consumers, irrespective of their economic and social status. Protecting the  consumer's interest relating to food products means providing him wholesome,  hygienically prepared and pre-tested quality products to enable him to lead a  healthy life. The consumers are often cheated through deceptive and defective  weights and measures and adulteration.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctrine of &quot;caveat  emptor&quot;, <em>i.e.,</em> 'let the buyer  beware' has long been the corner-stone of the consumer laws in India and this  is virtually not acceptable to the average consumer now. The doctrine put  forward in his favour with the growing consumer awareness is &quot;<em>caveat venditor</em>&quot;, that is, 'let the  seller beware'.<br />
                  Various Acts were framed by the  government from time to time to protect the consumers. Some of the main Acts  enacted and statutory orders passed by the Government to subserve the interest  of the consumers are:</p>
                <ol>
                  <ol>
                    <li>The  Indian Sale of Goods Act, 1930.</li>
                    <li>The  Agricultural Produce (Grading &amp; Marking) Act, 1937.</li>
                    <li>The  Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.</li>
                    <li>The  Indian Standards Institution (Certification Marks) Act, 1952 and now Bureau of  Indian standards Act, 1954.</li>
                    <li>The  Essential Commodities Act, 1955.</li>
                    <li>The  Fruit Products Order, 1955.</li>
                    <li>The  Sugar Control Order, 1956.</li>
                    <li>The  Export (Quality Control and Inspection) Act, 1963.</li>
                    <li>The  Vegetable Oil Products (Control) Order, 1967.</li>
                    <li>The  Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969, and amended in 1984.</li>
                    <li>The  Meat Food Products Order, 1975.</li>
                    <li>The  Packaged Commodities Order, 1975.</li>
                    <li>The  Standards of Weights and Measures Act, 1976.</li>
                    <li>The  Cold Storage Order, 1964 and 1980; and</li>
                    <li>The  Consumer's Protection Act, 1986, 1991, 1993, 2002.</li>
                  </ol>
                </ol>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  above list of legislations is quite impressive for the protection of the  consumers. In practice the situation appears obscure due to poor enforcement of  them. Under the latest Act, <em>i.e.,</em> the  Consumer's Protection Act of 1986, there is a provision that a consumer may get  his defective goods replaced or price refunded or get compensation for any loss  due to the unfair trade practices of the traders.<br />
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many voluntary agencies are working  in the country for giving strength to the consumers movement and the protection  of consumers. The important ones are Consumers Guidance Society of India,  Mumbai 1966; Consumer Council, Vishakhapatnam, 1970; Consumer Education and  Research Centre, Ahmedabad; Consumer Action Forum, Kolkata; Karnataka Consumers  Service Society, Bangalore and Grahak Panchayats, Mumbai and Pune. The  Government has established Consumer's Protection Councils at the State and  district levels for the protection of the consumers. The work done by these  agencies has been commendable in extending the rights of the consumers by  keeping the producers conscious of consumer rights and interests. The main  contributions of the organizations are in areas of consumer education  (providing information about availability of goods, prices and trade  practices), product rating (testing of products) and liaison with government  and producers of products.<br />
  <strong>Quality Management in Food</strong><br />
  <strong>(a) HACCP</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  rejection of Indian wheat consignments by Iraq, gherkin containers by European  Union and grape containers by U.K. and domestic complaints of presence of rat  droppings in wheat are some of the examples quoted as non-compliance of food  safety norms. It has harmed our business both on the export front and in the  local market. By and large, the 'Made in India' label is considered as  sub-standard produce by people of many countries. Therefore, there is a need to  change this perception to make a significant dent in the food export market  especially in the processing sector. Food processing sector comprising fruits  and vegetables, grains, milk, fish, meat, poultry products, soft drinks, and  alcoholic beverages is one of the largest sector in terms of production,  consumption, employment generation and from export prospects. As such adoption  of HACCP concept is important. There is a need to generate continuous awareness  and run educational programmes for exporters and also have a legislation to  ensure safety norms.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concept was not so important  when the food chain was localized and people consumed locally produced fresh  harvested or cooked food without prolonged storage. In recent times, food has  become a global issue. Good-looking fresh fruits and vegetables might contain  hazardous chemicals and bacteria which may cause ill effects on the health of  the consumers, instantaneously or at a later date. Quality management of food  is, therefore, essential in fruits and vegetables and other processed products  from the safety point of view.<br />
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new era in food safety started in  1960s when USA planned to send astronauts in spaceship to moon. For such a  mission, it was necessary to ensure that food provided to the astronauts would  not cause illness while on board. With this objective, Pillsbury of N.A.S.A.  (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) developed and used HACCP as  preventive system for preparation of food for astronauts.<br />
                  HACCP and Risk Analysis is a modern  concept of quality management applied to food items. The concept of HACCP  gained recognition and acceptance globally as a system of choice for good  safety due to following reasons:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>To identify food safety hazards for different  farm products and their process of production.</li>
                  <li>To  accept responsibility for food safety instead of relying upon compliance with  official regulation and inspection by food safety inspectors.</li>
                  <li>Necessity  of creating awareness among people to realize their role and responsibility for  food safety.</li>
                  <li>To  improve the design of food products and process for achieving safe food, and</li>
                  <li>To  prepare food companies for future HACCP based food safety regulations and trade  specifications.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International  food safety standards are developed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission  (CODEX). This is a joint commission of FAO and WHO and recognizes HACCP based  system for food. As per the WTO requirement, only Codex standards are  acceptable for international trade. Therefore, Codex-HACCP is minimum  international standard for trade among countries in future. Based on this  analysis, appropriate action can be taken to ensure that the areas identified  as critical control points are kept under control and are not allowed to  endanger the items produced.<br />
                  There  are seven principles of Codex-HACCP.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Conduct a hazard analysis.</li>
                  <li>Determine  the critical control points (CCPs)</li>
                  <li>Establish  critical limit</li>
                  <li>Establish  a system to monitor control of the CCP</li>
                  <li>Establish  the corrective action to be taken when the monitoring indicates that a particular  CCP is not under control.</li>
                  <li>Establish  procedure for verification to confirm that the HACCP system is working  effectively.</li>
                  <li>Establish  documentation concerning all procedures and records appropriate to these  principles and their application.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food  safety is analysed in terms of hazards and risks. A hazard is the capacity of a  thing to cause harm under certain conditions. The probability that a defined  harm will occur is the risk associated with the hazard. The hazards may be  physical, chemical or micro-biological and can occur at any stage from raw  material to the consumption by the consumer.<br />
                  The  benefits of testing food by HACCP are;</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Avoids human sufferings;</li>
                  <li>Reduces  burden from over burdened health care system;</li>
                  <li>Increases  the export of food products;</li>
                  <li>Attracts  more foreign tourists; and</li>
                  <li>Increases  earning potential of citizens.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>(b) ECOMARK</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  Government of India instituted a scheme known as ECOMARK in February, 1991 for  labeling environment friendly products. This scheme is administered by the  Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The scheme provides for labeling of household  and other consumer products which meet certain environmental criteria along  with quality requirements prescribed in relevant Indian Standards. For a  product to be eligible for ECOMARK, the product shall confirm to the relevant  Indian Standards as well as additional requirement incorporated for ensuring  environment friendly nature of the product. The mark is a combination of BIS  Standards Mark (ISI) and the Eco logo.<br />
                  <strong>(c) Mark to Identify Vegetarian/Non-Vegetarian  Food Products</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  Government of India by an amendment in the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act,  1955 on 4th October, 2001 and 20th June, 2002 has made it  mandatory for the manufacturers of food products to put a label indicating whether  the food has been prepared using meat and allied products or otherwise. Under  this amendment, the packed food products bearing a mark of a dot in a square in  green colour is indicator of vegetarian product and a mark is brown colour is  indicator of non-vegetarian food. This amendment is applicable throughout the  country.</p>
                <strong><br clear="all" />
                </strong>
                <p><strong>(d) Mark of FPO</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  products carrying a mark of FPO in an oval with two hanging strips (making  inverted – V shape) is mandatory on packed containers of fruits and vegetables  processed products. This indicates the quality of the product and conveys that  the production of processed fruit products has been carried out under clean and  sanitary conditions. This mark is issued by the Ministry of Food Processing  Industries of Government of India, New Delhi.<br />
                  Currently, there are 27 laws  relating to food in the country. The Government of India has constituted a  group of Ministers to prepare a modern food law by integrating all of the  multifarious laws and regulations.<br />
  <strong>Consumer Education and Research Centre  (CREC)</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  Consumer Education and Research Centre (CREC) is a political, non-profit  organization situated at Ahmedabad. It is a public charitable trust registered  under the Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950. The CREF is recognized as consumer organization  by the Government of Gujarat. This is the only consumer organization recognized  as Research Institute by the Central Government on the recommendation of the  Department of Science and Technology.<br />
                  The main objectives and functions of  this centre are:</p>
