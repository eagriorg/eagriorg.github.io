				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mankind  is considered the superior to the living things in the world. Civilization  transformed that into producer of food and other basic requirements from the  nomadic behavior in which hunting and snatching were the way of life. Land  cultivation and food production marked the beginning of civilization  particularly in the riparian lands. Mother Nature has to offer Her blessings to  satisfy the food needs of all living creatures. Land cultivation, otherwise  known as farming is influenced by the behavior of natural events like rainfall,  drought, flood, storm and so on and so forth. Food production has its  limitations and so all food cannot be produced in all places. In other words,  food production is restricted to specific locations where the soil, weather and  moisture favor that activity. Nevertheless food produced has to be consumed worldwide  by the human beings, animals, birds and others in need. A group of people  specializing in food production and identified as farmers shoulder the noble  responsibility of feeding the entire world. Hence there is no need to emphasis  that food produced at specific places has to be distributed to other places of  consumption. It is in this juncture, marketing plays its vital role.       <br />
            Marketing is as critical to better  performance in agriculture as farming itself. Therefore, market reform and  marketing system improvement ought to be an integral part of policy and  strategy for agricultural development. Although a considerable progress has  been achieved in technological improvements in agriculture by the use of  high-yielding variety seeds and chemical fertilizers, and by the adoption of  plant protection measures, the rate of growth in farming in developing  countries limping behind the desired levels. This has been largely attributed  to the fact that not enough attention has been devoted to the facilities and  services which must be available to farmers that would support agricultural sector  for its development. Marketing is one of those facilities needed for over all  economic development of nations.<br />
<strong>Concept and Definition</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>The  term <em>agricultural marketing</em> is  composed of two words – agriculture and marketing. Agriculture, in the broadest  sense, means activities aimed at the use of natural resources for human welfare, <em>i.e.</em>, it includes all the primary  activities of production. But, generally, it is used to mean growing and/or  raising crops and livestock. Marketing encompasses a series of activities  involved in moving the goods from the point of production to the point of  consumption. It includes all activities involved in the creation of time,  place, form and possession utility.<br />
            Philip Kotler has defined marketing  as a human activity directed at satisfying the needs and wants through exchange  process. <br />
American  Marketing Association defined marketing as the performance of business  activities that directs the flow of goods and services from producers to users.<br />
            According to Thomsen, the study of  agricultural marketing comprises all the operations, and the agencies  conducting them, involved in the movement of farm-produced foods, raw materials  and their derivatives, such as textiles, from the farms to the final consumers,  and the effects of such operations on farmers, middlemen and consumers. <br />
            Agricultural marketing is the study  of all the activities, agencies and policies involved in the procurement of  farm inputs by the farmers and the movement of agricultural products from the  farms to the consumers. The agricultural marketing system is a link between the  farm and the non-farm sectors. It includes the organization of agricultural raw  materials supply to processing industries, the assessment of demand for farm  inputs and raw materials, and the policy relating to the marketing of farm  products and inputs.<br />
            According to the National Commission  on Agriculture (XII Report, 1976), agricultural marketing is a process which  starts with a decision to produce a saleable farm commodity, and it involves  all the aspects of market structure or system, both functional and institutional,  based on technical and economic considerations, and includes pre- and  post-harvest operations, assembling, grading, storage, transportation and  distribution.<br />
Agricultural  marketing system in developing countries including India can be understood to  compose of two major sub-systems <em>viz</em>.,  product marketing and input (factor) marketing. The actors in the product  marketing sub-system include farmers, village/primary traders, wholesalers,  processors, importers, exporters, marketing cooperatives, regulated market  committees and retailers. The input sub-system includes input manufacturers,  distributors, related associations, importers, exporters and others who make  available various farm production inputs to the farmers.<br />
However,  as Acharya has described, in a dynamic and growing agricultural sector, the  agricultural marketing system ought to be understood and developed as a link  between the farm and the non-farm sectors. A dynamic and growing agricultural sector  requires fertilizers, pesticides, farm equipments, machinery, diesel,  electricity, packing material and repair services which are produced and  supplied by the industry and non-farm enterprises. The expansion in the size of  farm output stimulates forward linkages by providing surpluses of food and natural  fibres which require transportation, storage, milling or processing, packaging  and retailing to the consumers. These functions are obviously performed by  non-farm enterprises. Further, if the increase in agricultural production is  accompanied by a rise in real incomes of farm families, the demand of these  families for non-farm consumer goods goes up as the proportion of income spent  on non-food consumables and durables tends to rise with the increase in real  per capital income. Several industries, thus find new markets for their  products in the farm sector.<br />
            Agricultural marketing, therefore,  can be defined as comprising of all activities involved in supply of farm  inputs to the farmers and movement of agricultural products from the farms to  the consumers. Agricultural marketing system includes the assessment of demand  for farm-inputs and their supply, post-harvest handling of farm products,  performance of various activities required in transferring farm products from  farm gate to processing industries and/or to ultimate consumers, assessment of  demand for farm products and public policies and programmes relating to the  pricing, handling, and purchase and sale of farm inputs and agricultural  products. Of late trade in the domestic and international markets also become  the part of it.<br />
<strong>Scope and Subject Matter</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>Agricultural  marketing in a broader sense is concerned with the marketing of farm products  produced by farmers and of farm inputs and services required by them in the  production of these farm products. Thus, the subject of agricultural marketing  includes product marketing as well as input marketing.<br />
            The subject of output marketing is  as old as civilization itself. The importance of output marketing has become  more conspicuous in the recent past with the increased marketable surplus of  the crops and other agricultural commodities following the technological  breakthrough. On one hand surplus production in agriculture resulted in problem  of distribution to consumption centres and on the other transformed agriculture  into a commercial venture where market needs came to the lime lite. Input  marketing is a comparatively new subject. Farmers in the past used such farm  sector inputs as local seeds and farmyard manure. These inputs were available  with them; the purchase of inputs for production of crops from the market by  the farmers was almost negligible. The importance of farm inputs – improved  seeds, fertilizers, insecticides and pesticides, farm machinery, implements and  credit – in the production of farm products has increased in recent decades.  The new agricultural technology is input-responsive. Thus, the scope of  agricultural marketing must include both product marketing and input marketing.  In this book, the subject-matter of agricultural marketing has been dealt with;  both from the theoretical and practical points of view. It covers what the  system is, how it functions, and how the given methods or techniques may be  modified to get the maximum benefits.<br />
            Specially, the subject of  agricultural marketing includes marketing functions, agencies, channels,  efficiency and costs, price spread and market integration, producer's surplus, marketing  institutions, government policy and research,   imports/exports of agricultural commodities and commodity and futures trading.<br />
<strong>New Role of Agricultural Marketing</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>Agricultural  marketing scenario in the country has undergone a sea-change over the last six decades  owing to the increases in the supply of agricultural commodities and  consequently in their marketed surpluses; increase in urbanization and income  levels and thereby changes in the pattern of demand for farm products and their  derivatives; slow and steady increase in the linkages with the overseas  markets; and changes in the form and degree of government intervention in  agricultural markets. Therefore, the framework under which agricultural produce  markets function and the factors which influence the prices received by the  farmers now need to be understood in a different perspective compared to that  in the past. The role of marketing now starts right from the time of decision  relating to what to produce, which variety to produce and how to prepare the  product for marketing rather than limiting it to when, where and to whom to  sell.<br />
<strong>Markets and Marketing</strong><br />
<strong>Market – Meaning</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>The  word <em>market</em> originated from the latin  word 'marcatus' which means merchandise or trade or a place where business is  conducted.<br />
Word  'market' has been widely and variedly used to mean: (a) a place or a building  where commodities are bought and sold, <em>e.g.,</em> super market; (b) potential buyers and sellers of a product; <em>e.g.,</em> wheat market and cotton market;  (c) potential buyers and sellers of a country or region, <em>e.g</em>., Indian market and Asian market; (d) an organization which  provides facilities for exchange of commodities, <em>e.g</em>., Bombay stock exchange; and (e) a phase or a course of  commercial activity, <em>e.g</em>., a dull  market or bright market.<br />
There  is an old English saying that two women and a goose may make a market. However,  in common parlance, a market includes any place where persons assemble for the  sale or purchase of commodities intended for satisfying human wants. Other  terms used for describing markets in India are <em>Haats, Painths, Shandies</em> and <em>Bazar</em>.<br />
The  word market in the economic sense carries a broad meaning. Some of the  definitions of market are given below:</p>
                <ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>A market is the sphere within which <strong>price determining forces</strong> operate.</li>
                  <li>A market is the area within which the       forces of <strong>demand and supply</strong> converge to establish a <strong>single       price.</strong></li>
                  <li>The term market means not a particular       market place in which things are bought and sold but the <strong>whole of any region</strong> in which       buyers and sellers are in such a free intercourse with one another that       the prices of the same goods tend to equality, easily and quickly.</li>
                  <li>Market means a <strong>social institution</strong> which performs activities and provides       facilities for exchanging commodities between buyers and sellers.</li>
                  <li>Economically interpreted, the term       market refers, not to a place but to a <strong>commodity or commodities and buyers and sellers</strong> who are in       free intercourse with one another.</li>
                  <li>The American Marketing Association has       defined a market as <strong>the aggregate       demand o</strong>f the potential buyers for a product/service.</li>
                  <li>Philip Kotler defined market as an <strong>area for potential exchanges.</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>A  market exists when buyers wishing to exchange the money for a good or service  are in contact with the sellers who are willing to exchange goods or services  for money. Thus, a market is defined in terms of the existence of fundamental  forces of supply and demand and is not necessarily confined to a particular  geographical location. The concept of a market is basic to most of the  contemporary economies, since in a free market economy, this is the mechanism  by which resources are allocated.<br />
                  <strong>Components of a Market</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>For  a market to exist, certain conditions must be satisfied. These conditions  should be both necessary and sufficient. They may also be termed as the  components of a market.</p>
                <ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>The existence of a good or commodity for       transactions (physical existence is, however, not necessary);</li>
                  <li>The existence of buyers and sellers;</li>
                  <li>Price at which the commodity is       transacted or exchanged</li>
                  <li>Business relationship or intercourse       between buyers and sellers; and </li>
                  <li>Demarcation of area such as place,       region, country or the whole world.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Dimensions of a Market</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>There  are various dimensions of any specified market. These dimensions are:</p>
                <ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Location       or place of operation</li>
                  <li>Area       or coverage</li>
                  <li>Time       span</li>
                  <li>Volume       of transactions</li>
                  <li>Nature       of transactions</li>
                  <li>Number       of commodities</li>
                  <li>Degree       of competition</li>
                  <li>Nature       of commodities</li>
                  <li>Stage       of marketing</li>
                  <li>Extent       of public intervention</li>
                  <li>Type       of population served</li>
                  <li>Accrual       of marketing margins</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Any  individual market may be classified in a twelve-dimensional space.<br />
                  <strong>Classification of Markets</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Markets  may be classified on the basis of each of the twelve dimensions already listed.<br />
                  <strong>1. On the Basis of Location or Place of  Operation</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>On  the basis of the place of location or place of operation, markets are of the  following types:<br />
                  <strong>(a)  Village Market:</strong> A market which is located in a small village, where major  transactions take place among the buyers and sellers normally residing in that  village, is called a village market.<br />
                  <strong>(b)  Primary Markets:</strong> These markets are located in towns near the centres of  production of agricultural commodities. In these markets, a major part of the  produce is brought for sale by the producer-farmers themselves. Transactions in  these markets usually take place between the farmers and primary traders.<br />
  <strong>            (c)  Secondary Wholesale Markets:</strong> These markets are located  generally at district headquarters or important trade centres or near railway  junctions. The major transactions of commodities in these markets take place  between the village traders and wholesalers. The bulk of the arrivals in these  markets are from other markets. The produce in these markets is handled in  large quantities. There are, therefore, specialized marketing agencies  performing different marketing functions, such as those of commission agents,  brokers and weighmen in these markets. These markets help in assembling  commodities from neighboring district/tehsil/state.<br />
                  <strong>(d)  Terminal Markets:</strong> A terminal market is one where the produce is either  finally disposed of to the consumers or processors, or assembled for export. In  these markets, merchants are well organized and use modern methods of  marketing. Commodity exchanges exist in these markets which provide facilities  for forward trading in specific commodities. Such markets are located either in  metropolitan cities or at sea-ports. Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Kolkata  and Cochin are terminal markets in India for many commodities.<br />
                  <strong>(e)  Seaboard Markets:</strong> Markets which are located near the seashore and are meant  mainly for the import and/or export of goods are known as seaboard markets.  These are generally seaport towns. Examples of these markets in India are  Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkatta and Cochin (Kochi).<br />
  <strong>2. On the Basis of Area/Coverage</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>On  the basis of the area from which buyers and sellers usually come for  transactions, markets may be classified into the following four classes:<br />
                  <strong>(a)  Local or Village Markets:</strong> A market in which the buying and selling  activities are confined among the buyers and sellers drawn from the same  village or nearby villages. The village markets exist mostly for perishable  commodities in small lots, <em>e.g.,</em> local milk market or vegetable market.<br />
                  <strong>(b)  Regional Markets:</strong> A market in which buyers and sellers for a commodity are  drawn from a larger area than the local markets. Regional markets in India  usually exist for food grains.<br />
                  <strong>(c)  National Markets:</strong> A market in which buyers and sellers spread at the  national level. Earlier national markets existed for only durable goods like  jute and tea. But with the expansion of roads, transport and communication  facilities, the markets for most of the products have taken the form of  national markets.<br />
                  <strong>(d)  World or International Market:</strong> A market in which the buyers and sellers are  drawn from more than one country or the whole world. These are the biggest  markets from the area point of view. These markets exist for the commodities  which have a world-wide demand and/or supply, such as coffee, machinery, gold,  silver, etc. In recent years many countries are moving towards a regime of  liberal international trade in agricultural products like raw cotton, sugar,  rice and wheat. It is expected that the international trade in such commodities  will become free from many restrictions that exist now.<br />
  <strong>3. On the Basis of Time Span</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>On  this basis, markets are of the following types:<br />
                  <strong>(a)  Short period Markets:</strong> The markets which are held only for a day or few  hours are called short-period markets. The products dealt within these markets  are of a highly perishable nature, such as fish, fresh vegetables, and liquid  milk. In these markets, the prices of commodities are governed mainly by the extent  of demand for, rather than by the supply of, the commodity.<br />
                  <strong>(b)  Periodic Markets:</strong> The periodic markets are congregation of buyers and  sellers at specified places either in villages, semi-urban areas or some parts  of urban areas on specific days and time. Major commodities traded in these  markets is the farm produce grown in the hinterlands. The periodic markets are  held weekly, biweekly, fortnightly or monthly according to the local  traditions. These are similar to 'spontaneous markets' in several developed  countries.<br />
                  <strong>(c)  Long-period Markets:</strong> These markets are held for a longer period than the  short-period markets. The commodities traded in these markets are less  perishable and can be stored for some time; like foodgrains and oilseeds. The  prices are governed both by the supply and demand forces.<br />
                  <strong>(d)  Secular Markets:</strong> These are markets of a permanent nature. The commodities  traded in these markets are durable in nature and can be stored for many years.  Examples are markets for machinery and manufactured goods.<br />
  <strong>4. On the Basis of Volumes of  Transactions</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>There  are two types of markets on the basis of volume of transactions at a time.<br />
                  <strong>(a)  Wholesale Markets:</strong> A wholesale market is one in which commodities are  bought and sold in large lots or in bulk. These markets are generally located  in either towns or cities. The economic activities in and around these markets  are so intense that over time the population tends to get concentrated around  these markets. These markets occupy an extremely important link in the  marketing chain of all the commodities including farm products. Apart from  balancing the supply and demand and discovery of the prices of a commodity,  these markets and functionaries in them serve as a link between the production  system and consumption system. The wholesale markets for farm products in India  can be classified as primary, secondary and terminal wholesale markets. The  primary wholesale markets are in the nature of assembling centres located in  and around producing regions. The transactions in primary wholesale markets  take place mainly between farmers and traders. Secondary wholesale markets are  generally located between primary wholesale and terminal markets. The  transactions in these markets take place between primary wholesalers and traders  of terminal market. The terminal markets are generally located at the large  urban metropolitan cities or export centres catering to the large consuming  population around them or in the overseas markets.<br />
                  <strong>(b)  Retail Markets:</strong> A retail market is one in which commodities are bought by  and sold to the consumers as per their requirements. Transactions in these  markets take place between retailers and consumers. The retailers purchase the  goods from wholesale market and sell in small lots to the consumers in retail  markets. These markets are very near to the consumers.<br />
                  The distinction between the  wholesale and retain market can be made mainly on the basis of buyer. A retail  market means that the buyers are generally ultimate consumers, whereas in the  wholesale market the buyers can be wholesalers or retailers. But sometimes-bulk  consumers also purchase from the wholesale markets. The quantity transacted in  retail markets is generally smaller than that in the wholesale markets.<br />
  <strong>5. On the Basis of Nature of Transactions</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  markets which are based on the types of transactions in which people are  engaged are of two types:<br />
                  <strong>(a)  Spot or Cash Markets: </strong>A market in which goods are exchanged for money  immediately after the sale is called the spot or cash market.<br />
                  <strong>(b)  Forward Markets:</strong> A market in which the purchase and sale of a commodity  takes place at time <em>t</em> but the  exchange of the commodity takes place on some specified date in future <em>i.e.,</em> time <em>t</em> + 1. Sometimes even on the specified date in the future (<em>t</em> + 1), there may not be any exchange of  the commodity. Instead, the differences in the purchase and sale prices are  paid or taken.<br />
  <strong>6. On the Basis of Number of Commodities  in which Transaction Takes Place</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>A  market may be general or specialized on the basis of the number of commodities  in which transactions are completed:<br />
  <strong>            (a)  General Markets:</strong> A market in which all types of commodities,  such as foodgrains, oilseeds, fibre crops, gur, etc., are bought and sole is  known as general market. These markets deal in a large number of commodities.<br />
                  <strong>(b)  Specialized Markets:</strong> A market in which transactions take place only in one  or two commodities is known as a specialized market. For every group of  commodities, separate markets exist. The examples of specialized markets are  foodgrain markets, vegetable markets, wool market and cotton market.<br />
  <strong>7. On the Basis of Degree of Competition</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Each  market can be placed on a continuous scale, starting from a perfectly  competitive point to a pure monopoly or monopsony situation. Extreme forms are  almost non-existent. Nevertheless, it is useful to know their characteristics.  In addition to these two extremes, various midpoints of this continuum have  been identified. On the basis of competition, markets may be classified into  the following categories:<br />
                  <strong>(a)  Perfect Markets:</strong> A perfect market is one in which the following conditions  hold good:<br />
                  (i) There is a large number of  buyers and sellers;<br />
                  (ii) All the buyers and sellers in  the market have perfect knowledge of demand, supply and prices;<br />
                  (iii) Prices at any one time are  uniform over a geographical area, plus or minus the cost of getting supplies  from surplus to deficit areas;<br />
                  (iv) The prices of different forms  of a product are uniform, plus or minus the cost of converting the product from  one form to another.<br />
                  <strong>(b)  Imperfect Markets:</strong> The markets in which the conditions of perfect  competition are lacking are characterized as imperfect markets. The following  situations, each based on the degree of imperfection, may be identified:<br />
                  <strong>(i)  Monopoly Market:</strong> Monopoly is a market situation in which there is only one  seller of a commodity. He exercises sole control over the quantity or price of  the commodity. In this market, the price of a commodity is generally higher  than in other markets. Indian farmers operate in monopoly market when  purchasing electricity for irrigation. When there is only one buyer of a  product, the market is termed as a monopsony market.<br />
                  <strong>(ii)  Duopoly Market:</strong> A duopoly market is one which has only two sellers of a  commodity. They may mutually agree to charge a common price which is higher  than the hypothetical price in a common market. The market situation in which  there are only two buyers of a commodity is known as the duopsony market.<br />
                  <strong>(iii)  Oligopoly Market:</strong> A market in which there are more than two but still a few  sellers of a commodity is termed as an oligopoly market. A market having a few  (more than two) buyers is known as oligopsony market.<br />
                  <strong>(iv)  Monopolistic Competition: </strong>When a large number of sellers deal in  heterogeneous and differentiated form of a commodity, the situation is called  monopolistic competition. The difference is made conspicuous by different trade  marks on the product. Different prices prevail for the same basic product.  Examples of monopolistic competition faced by farmers may be drawn from the  input markets. For example, they have to chose between various makes of  insecticides, pumpsets, fertilizers and equipments.</p>
                <p><strong>8. On the Basis of Nature of Commodities</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>On  the basis of the type of goods dealt in, market may be classified into the  following categories:<br />
                  <strong>(a)  Commodity Markets:</strong> A market which deals in goods and raw materials, such as  wheat, barley, cotton, fertilizer, seed, etc., are termed as commodity markets.<br />
                  <strong>(b)  Capital Markets:</strong> The market in which bonds, shares and securities are  bought and sold are called capital markets; for example, money markets and  share markets.<br />
  <strong>9. On the Basis of Stage of Marketing</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>On  the basis of the stage of marketing, markets may be classified into two  categories:<br />
                  <strong>(a)  Producing Markets:</strong> Those markets which mainly assemble the commodity for  further distribution to other markets are termed as producing markets. Such  markets are located in producing areas.<br />
                  <strong>(b)  Consuming Markets:</strong> Markets which collect the produce for final disposal to  the consuming population are called consumer markets. Such markets are  generally located in areas where production is inadequate, or in thickly  populated urban centres.<br />
  <strong>10. On the Basis of Extent of Public  Intervention</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Based  on the extent of public intervention, markets may be placed in any one of the  following two classes:<br />
                  <strong>(a)  Regulated Markets:</strong> These are those markets in which business is done in  accordance with the rules and regulations framed by the statutory market  organization representing different sections involved in markets. The marketing  costs in such markets are standardized and, marketing practices are regulated.<br />
                  <strong>(b)  Unregulated Markets:</strong> These are the markets in which business is conducted  without any set rules and regulations. Traders frame the rules for the conduct  of the business and run the market. These markets suffer from many ills,  ranging from unstandardised charges for marketing functions to imperfections in  the determination of prices.<br />
  <strong>11. On the Basis of Type of Population  Served</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>On  the basis of population served by a market, it can be classified as either  urban or rural market.<br />
                  <strong>(a)  Urban Market:</strong> A market which serves mainly the population residing in an  urban area is called an urban market. The nature and quantum of demand for agricultural  products arising from the urban population is characterized as urban market for  farm products.<br />
  <strong>            (b)  Rural Market:</strong> The word rural market usually refers to the  demand originating from the rural population. There is considerable difference  in the nature of embedded services required with a farm product between urban  and rural demands.<br />
                  Rural markets generally have poor  marketing facilities as compared to urban markets. According to the survey of  the Directorate of Marketing and Inspection (DMI) of Government of India, only  46 per cent of rural primary markets, of the country have the facility of  market yards; 6.4 per cent have office buildings, 3.2 per cent have cattle  shed, 3 per cent have canteen, 4.9 per cent have storage facilities, 5.1 per  cent have auction platforms, 12.9 per cent have drinking water facility and 5.2  per cent markets have electricity facility. Marketing support services such as  godowns, cleaning, price information and extension services were found  completely non-existent in most of these rural markets.<br />
  <strong>12. On the Basis of Market Functionaries  and Accrual of Marketing Margins</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Markets  can also be classified on the basis of as to who are the market functionaries  and to whom the marketing margins accrue. Over the years, there has been a  considerable increase in the producers or consumers co-operatives or other  organizations handling marketing of various products. Though private trade  still handles bulk of the trade in farm products, the co-operative marketing  has increased its share in the trade of some agricultural commodities like  milk, fertilizers, sugarcane and sugar. In the case of marketing activities  undertaken by producers or consumers co-operatives, the marketing margins are  either negligible or shared amongst their members. In some cases, farmers  themselves work as sellers of their produce to the consumers. On the basis, the  market can be (<strong>a) farmers markets, (b)  cooperative markets or (c) general markets.</strong><br />
                  It must be noted that each market or  market place can be classified on the basis of the 12 criteria mentioned above.  A 12-dimensional classification of markets is shown in Chart 1.1.</p>

                <p><strong>Importance of Agricultural Marketing</strong></p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agricultural  marketing plays an important role not only in stimulating production and  consumption, but in accelerating the pace of economic development. Its dynamic  functions are of primary importance in promoting economic development. For this  reason, it has been described as the most important multiplier of agricultural  development.<br />
            India's age-old farming practices  have taken a turn in recent decades. There has been a technological  breakthrough – the evolution of high-yielding variety seeds, increasing use of  fertilizers, insecticides, pesticides, the installation of pumping sets, and  tractorization. This technological breakthrough has led to a substantial  increase in production on the farms and to the larger marketable and marketed  surplus. To maintain this tempo and pace of increased production through  technological development, an assurance of remunerative prices to the farmer is  a prerequisite, and this assurance can be given to the farmer by developing an  efficient marketing system.<br />
            The agricultural marketing system  plays a dual role in economic development in countries whose resources are  primarily agricultural. Increasing demands for money with which to purchase  other goods leads to increasing sensitivity to relative prices on the part of  the producers, and specialization in the cultivation of those crops on which  the returns are the greatest, subject to socio-cultural, ecological and  economic constraints. It is the marketing system that transmits the crucial  price signals. On the other hand, and in order to sustain the growth of the  non-agricultural sector, resources have to be extracted from the agricultural  sector – physical resources to guarantee supplies of food and raw materials for  the agro-industry and financial resources for investment in non-farm economy as  well as for re-investment in agriculture.<br />
            On the basis of IADP experience,  Kiehl has shown that the &quot;marketing problem&quot; begins to emerge in the  process of shifting from traditional to modern agriculture because of  production surpluses generated by the shift. Indeed, the term modern  agriculture implies a market-oriented agriculture. The scope for moving towards  modern agriculture must include market dimensions if the momentum of production  transformation is to be sustained.<br />
            The importance of agricultural  marketing in economic development is revealed from the following:<br />
<strong>(i) Optimization of Resource use and  Output Management</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>An  efficient agricultural marketing system leads to the optimization of resource  use and output management. An efficient marketing system can also contribute to  an increase in the marketable surplus by scaling down the losses arising out of  inefficient processing, storage and transportation. A well-designed system of  marketing can effectively distribute the available stock of modern inputs, and  thereby sustain a faster rate of growth in the agricultural sector.<br />
<strong>(ii) Increase in Farm Income</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>An  efficient marketing system ensures higher levels of income for the farmers  reducing the number of middlemen or by restricting the cost of marketing  services and the malpractices, in the marketing of farm products. An efficient  system guarantees the farmers better prices for farm products and induces them  to invest their surpluses in the purchase of modern inputs so that productivity  and production may increase. This again results in an increase in the marketed  surplus and income of the farmers. If the producer does not have an easily  accessible market-outlet where he can sell his surplus produce, he has little  incentive to produce more. The need for providing adequate incentives for  increased production is, therefore, very important, and this can be made  possible only by streamlining the marketing system.<br />
<strong>(iii) Widening of Markets</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>An  efficient and well-knot marketing system widens the market for the products by  taking them to remote corners both within and outside the country, i.e., to  areas far away from the production points. The widening of the market helps in  increasing the demand on a continuous basis, and thereby guarantees a higher income  to the producer.<br />
<strong>(iv) Growth of Agro-based Industries</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>An  improved and efficient system of agricultural marketing helps in the growth of  agro-based industries and stimulates the overall development process of the  economy. Many industries like cotton, sugar, edible oils, food processing and  jute depend on agriculture for the supply of raw materials.<br />
<strong>(v) Price Signals</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>An  efficient marketing system helps the farmers in planning their production in  accordance with the needs of the economy. This work is carried out through  transmitting price signals.<br />
<strong>(vi) Adoption and Spread of New  Technology</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>The  marketing system helps the farmers in the adoption of new scientific and  technical knowledge. New technology requires higher investment and farmers  would invest only if they are assured of market clearance at remunerative  price.<br />
<strong>(vii) Employment Creation</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>The  marketing system provides employment to millions of persons engaged in various  activities, such as packaging, transportation, storage and processing. Persons  like commission agents, brokers, traders, retailers, weighmen, hamals,  packagers and regulating staff are directly employed in the marketing system.  This apart, several others find employment in supplying goods and services  required by the marketing system.<br />
<strong>(viii) Addition to National Income</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>Marketing  activities add value to the product thereby increasing the nation's gross  national product and net national product.<br />
<strong>(ix) Better Living</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>The  marketing system is essential for the success of the development programmes  which are designed to uplift the population as a whole. Any plan of economic  development that aims at diminishing the poverty of the agricultural  population, reducing consumer food prices, earning more foreign exchange or  eliminating economic waste has, therefore, to pay special attention to the  development of an efficient marketing for food and agricultural products.<br />
<strong>(x) Creation of Utility</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>Marketing  is productive, and is as necessary as the farm production. It is, in fact, a  part of production itself, for production is complete only when the product  reaches a place in the form and at the time required by the consumers.  Marketing adds cost to the product, but, at the same time, it adds utilities to  the product. The following four types of utilities of the product are created  by marketing:<br />
            <strong>(a)  Form Utility: </strong>The processing function adds form utility to the product by  changing the raw material into a finished form. With this change, the product  becomes more useful than it is in the form in which it is produced by the  farmer. For example, through processing, oilseeds are converted into oil,  sugarcane into sugar, cotton into cloth and wheat into flour and bread. The  processed forms are more useful than the original raw materials.<br />
            <strong>(b)  Place Utility:</strong> The transportation function adds place utility to products  by shifting them to a place of need from the place of plenty. Products command  higher prices at the place of need than at the place of production because of  the increased utility of the product.<br />
            <strong>(c)  Time Utility:</strong> The storage function adds time utility to the products by  making them available at the time when they are needed.<br />
            <strong>(d)  Possession Utility:</strong> The marketing function of buying and selling helps in  the transfer of ownership from one person to another. Products are transferred  through marketing to persons having a higher utility from persons having a low  utility.<br />
            The foodgrain marketing system is  more important in India than the marketing of other agricultural commodities  because of the following reasons:<br />
            (a) Foodgrains account for around  two-thirds of the gross cropped area and 40 per cent of the gross value of crop  output in the country. Foodgrain marketing, therefore, provides income to most  Indian farmers so that they may buy the required inputs for the farm as well as  purchase items of domestic need;<br />
            (b) The foodgrain marketing business  provides livelihood to lakhs of traders, processors, commission agents and  other persons engaged in the foodgrain trade; and<br />
            (c) The foodgrain marketing system helps  in providing food for consumers and fodder for livestock.</p>
