				<p><strong>Market Structure – Meaning</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  term <em>structure</em> refers to something  that has organization and dimension – shape, size and design; and which is  evolved for the purpose of performing a function. A function modifies the  structure, and the nature of the existing structure limits the performance of  functions. By the term market structure we refer to the size and design of the  market. It also includes the manner of the operation of the market. Some of the  expressions describing the market structure are:<br />
            1. Market structure refers to those  organizational characteristics of a market which influence the nature of  competition and pricing, and affect the conduct of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;business firms,<br />
            2. Market structure refers to those  characteristics of the market which affect the traders' behaviour and their  performances,<br />
            3. Market structure is the formal  organization of the functional activity of a marketing institution.<br />
            An understanding and knowledge of  the market structure is essential for identifying the imperfections in the  performance of a market.<br />
<strong>Components of Market Structure</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>The  components of the market structure, which together determine the conduct and  performance of the market, are:</p>
                <p><strong>1. Concentration of Market Power</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  concentration of market power is an important element determining the nature of  competition and consequently of market conduct and performance. This is  measured by the number and size of firms existing in the market. The extent of  concentration represents the control of an individual firm or a group of firms  over the buying and selling of the produce. A high degree of market  concentration restricts the movement of goods between buyers and sellers at  fair and competitive prices, and creates an oligopoly or oligopsony situation  in the market.<br />
                  <strong>2. Degree of Product Differentiation</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Homogeneous  or other nature of the product affects the market structure. If products are  homogeneous, the price variations in the market will not be wide. When products  are heterogeneous, firms have the tendency to charge different prices for their  products. Everyone tries to prove that his product is superior to the products  of others.<br />
                  <strong>3. Conditions for entry of Firms in the  Market</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Another  dimension of the market structure is the restriction, if any, on the entry of  firms in the market. Sometimes, a few big firms do not allow new firms to enter  the market or make their entry difficult by their dominance in the market.  There may also be some government restrictions on the entry of firms.<br />
                  <strong>4. Flow of Market Information</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>A  well-organized market intelligence information system helps all the buyers and  sellers to freely interact with one another in arriving at prices and striking  deals.</p>
                <p><strong>5. Degree of Integration</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  behaviour of an integrated market will be different from that of a market where  there is no or less integration either among the firms or of their activities.<br />
                  Firms plan their strategies in  respect of the methods to be employed in determining prices, increasing sales,  coordinating with competing firms and adopting predatory practices against  rivals or potential entrants. The structural characteristics of the market  govern the behaviour of the firms in planning strategies for their selling and  buying operations.<br />
  <strong>Dynamics of Market Structure – Conduct  and Performance</strong><br />
                  The market structure determines the  market conduct and performance. The term market conduct refers to the patterns  of behaviour of firms, especially in relation to pricing and their practices in  adapting and adjusting to the market in which they function. Specifically,  market conduct includes:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Market  sharing and price setting policies;</li>
                  <li>Policies  aimed at coercing rivals; and</li>
                  <li>Policies  towards setting the quality of products.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The  term market performance refers to the economic results that flow from the  industry as each firm pursues its particular line of conduct. Society has to  decide the criteria for satisfactory market performance. Some of the criteria  for measuring market performance and of the efficiency of the market structure  are:<br />
                  1.  Efficiency in the use of resources, including real cost of performing various  functions;<br />
                  2. The existence of monopoly or  monopoly profits, including the relationship of margins with the average cost  of performing various functions;<br />
                  3. Dynamic progressiveness of the  system in adjusting the size and number of firms in relation to the volume of  business, in adopting technological innovations and in finding and/or inventing  new forms of products so as to maximize general social welfare.<br />
                  4. Whether or not the system  aggravates the problem of inequalities in inter-personal, inter-regional, or  inter-group incomes. For example, inequalities increase under the following  situations:<br />
                  (a) A market intermediary may pocket  a return greater than its real contribution to the national product;<br />
                  (b) Small farmers are discriminated  against when they are offered a lower return because of the low quantum of  surplus;<br />
                  (c) Inter-product price parity is  substantially disturbed by new uses for some products and wide variations and  rigidities in the production pattern between regions.<br />
                  The market structure, therefore, has  always to keep on adjusting to changing environment if it has to satisfy the  social goals. A static market structure soon becomes obsolete because of the  changes in the physical, economic, institutional and technological factors. For  a satisfactory market performance, the market structure should keep pace with  the following changes:<br />
  <strong>(i) Production Pattern</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Significant  changes occur in the production pattern because of technological, economic and  institutional factors. The market structure should be re-oriented to keep pace  with such changes. Emergence of producers groups or group marketing practice is  likely to alter market structure.<br />
  <strong>(ii) Demand Pattern</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  demand for various products, especially in terms of form and quality, keeps on  changing because of change in incomes, the pattern of distribution among  consumers, and changes in their tastes and habits. The market structure should  be re-oriented to keep it in harmony with the changes in demand.<br />
                  Change  in the consumption pattern and tastes and preferences of consumers leads to  specific or exclusive marketing practices followed by the companies to cater to  the specific needs of that group.<br />
  <strong>(iii) Costs and Patterns of Marketing  Functions</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Marketing  functions such as transportation, storage, financing and dissemination of  market information, have a great bearing on the type of market structure.  Recent policy encourages group marketing or operation of producer groups and  this is likely to reduce the number of buyers and/or sellers actually taking  part in marketing functions. Government policies with regard to purchases,  sales and subsidies affect the performance of market functions. The market  structure should keep on adjusting to the changes in costs and government  policy. Number of  players in the market  must be in accordance with the marketing functions performed and size of  operations to take advantage of size economy. <br />
  <strong>(iv) Technological Change in Industry</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Technological  changes necessitate changes in the market structure through adjustments in the  scale of business, the number of firms, and in their financial requirements.  Establishment of retail chains and entry of MNCs in the food retailing effected  conspicuous change in the structure of vegetable markets in India<br />
  <strong>Agricultural Marketing and Economic  Development</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Orderly  and efficient marketing of food grains plays an important role in solving the  problem of hunger. Most of those who go hungry do so because they can not pay  higher prices for food grains. If marketing system is not efficient, price  signals arising at the consumers' level are not adequately transferred to the  producers, as a result farmers do not get sufficient price incentive to increase  the production of the commodities which are in short supply. Thus, an  inefficient marketing system adversely affects the living standards of both the  farmers and consumers. In agricultural-oriented developing countries like  India, agricultural marketing plays a pivotal role in fostering and sustaining  the tempo of rural and economic development. Markets trigger the process of  development.<br />
                  The development of an efficient  marketing system is important in ensuring that scarce and essential commodities  reach different classes of consumers. Marketing is not only an economic link  between the producers and the consumers but it also helps to maintain a balance  between demand and supply. The objectives of price stability, rapid economic  growth and equitable distribution of goods and services cannot be achieved  without the support of an efficient marketing system.<br />
  <strong>Marketing Functions and their  Classification</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  marketing functions may be classified in various ways. For example, Thomsen has  classified the marketing functions into three broad groups. These are:</p>

                <p><strong>Marketing Agencies</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>In  the marketing of agricultural commodities, the following agencies are involved:<br />
                  <strong>(i) Producers</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Most  farmers or producers, perform one or more marketing functions. They sell the surplus  either in the village or in the market. Some farmers, especially the large  ones, assemble the produce of small farmers, transport it to the nearby market,  sell it there and make a profit. This activity helps these farmers to  supplement their incomes. Frequent visits to markets and constant touch with  market functionaries, bring home to them a fair knowledge of market practices.  They have, thus, an access to market information, and are able to perform the  functions of market middlemen,<br />
                  <strong>(ii) Middlemen</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Middlemen  are those individuals or business concerns which specialize in performing the  various marketing functions and rendering such services as are involved in the  marketing of goods. They do this at different stages in the marketing process.  The middlemen in foodgrain marketing may, therefore, be classified as follows:<br />
                  <strong>(a) Merchant Middlemen</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Merchant  middlemen are those individuals who take title to the goods they handle. They  buy and sell on their own and gain or lose, depending on the difference in the  sale and purchase prices. They may, moreover, suffer loss with a fall in the  price of the product. Merchant middlemen are of following types:<br />
                  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wholesalers :</strong> Wholesalers are those merchant middlemen who buy and sell foodgrains in large  quantities. They may buy either directly from farmers or from other  wholesalers. They sell foodgrains either in the same market or in other  markets. They sell to retailers, other wholesalers and processors. They do not  sell significant quantities to ultimate consumers. They own godowns for the  storage of the produce.<br />
                  The wholesalers perform the  following functions in marketing:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>They  assemble the goods from various localities and areas to meet the demands of  buyers;</li>
                  <li>They  sort out the goods in different lots according to their quality and prepare  them for the market;</li>
                  <li>They  equalize the flow of goods by storing them in the peak arrival season and  releasing them in the off-season;</li>
                  <li>They  regulate the flow of goods by trading with buyers and sellers in various  markets;</li>
                  <li>They  finance the farmers so that the latter may meet their requirements of  production inputs; and</li>
                  <li>They  assess the demand of prospective buyers and processors from time to time, and  plan the movement of the goods over space and time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retailers:</strong> Retailers buy goods from wholesalers and sell them to the consumers in small  quantities. They are producers' personal representatives to consumers.  Retailers are the closest to consumers in the marketing channel.<br />
                  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itinerant  Traders and Village Merchants:</strong> Itinerant traders are petty merchants who  move from village to village, and directly purchase the produce from the  cultivators. They transport it to the nearby primary or secondary market and  sell it there. Village merchants have their small establishments in villages.  They purchase the produce of those farmers who have either taken finance from  them or those who are not able to go to the market. Village merchants also  supply essential consumption goods to the farmers. They act as financers of  poor farmers. They often visit nearby markets and keep in touch with the  prevailing prices. They either sell the collected produce in the nearby market  or retain it for sale at a later date in the village itself.<br />
                  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mashakhores:</strong> This is a local term used for big retailers or small wholesalers dealing in  fruits and vegetables. Earlier, the mashakhores used to deal only in one or two  vegetables, purchasing from the commission agents or wholesalers in substantial  quantities usually three to four quintals of vegetables like potato, onion,  carrot, okra, tomato and spinach. They usually sell to the bulk consumers like  hotelwalas, para-miliary units or small retailers/vendors in lots of around 5  kg to 10 kg each. However, in recent years, mashakhores have started retailing  to all types of customers without the condition of a minimum quantity. In other  words, the mashakhores are now working more like ordinary retailers.<br />
  <strong>(b) Agent Middlemen</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Agent  Middlemen act as representatives of their clients. They do not take title to  the produce and, therefore, do not own it. They merely negotiate the purchase  and/or sale. They sell services to their principals and not the goods or  commodities. They receive income in the form of commission of brokerage. They  serve as buyers or sellers in effective bargaining. Agent middlemen are of two  types:<br />
                  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commission  Agents or Arhatias:</strong> A commission agent is a person operating in the  wholesale market who acts as the representative of either a seller or a buyer.  He is usually granted broad powers by those who consign goods or who order the  purchase. A commission agent normally takes over the physical handling of the  produce, arranges for its sale, collects the price from the buyer, deducts his  expenses and commission, and remits the balance to the seller. All these  facilities are extended to buyer-firms as well, if asked for.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commission agents or arhatias in  unregulated markets are of two types, <em>Kaccha  arhatias</em> and <em>Pacca arhatias</em>:  Kaccha arhatias primarily act for the sellers, including farmers. They  sometimes provide advance money to farmers and itinerant traders on the  condition that the produce will be disposed of through them. <em>Kaccha arhatias</em> charge <em>arhat</em> or commission in addition to the  normal rate of interest on the money they advance. A <em>Pacca arhatia</em> acts on behalf of the traders in the consuming  market. The processors (rice millers, oil millers and cotton or jute dealers)  and big wholesalers in the consuming markets employ <em>Pacca arhatias</em> as their agents for the purchase of a specified  quantity of goods within a given price range.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regulated markets, only one  category of commission agent exists under the name of 'A' class trader. The  commission agent keeps an establishment – a shop, a godown and a rest house for  his clients. He is, therefore, preferred by the farmers to the co-operative  marketing society for the purpose of the sale of the farmer's produce.  Commission agents extend the following facilities to their clients:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>They advance 40 to 50 per cent of the  expected value of the crop as a loan to farmers to enable them to meet their  production expenses;</li>
                  <li>They act as bankers of the farmers. They  retain the sale proceeds, and pay to the farmers as and when the latter require  the money;</li>
                  <li>They offer advice to farmers for purchase of  inputs and sale of products;</li>
                  <li>They provide empty bags to enable the farmers  to bring their produce to the market;</li>
                  <li>They provide food and accommodation to the  farmers and their animals when the latter come to the market for the sale of  their produce;</li>
                  <li>They provide storage facility and advance  loans against the stored product up to 75 per cent of the value;</li>
                  <li>They arrange, if required by the farmer, for  the transportation of the produce from the village to the market; and</li>
                  <li>They  help the farmers in times of personal difficulties.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brokers:</strong> Brokers render personal services to their clients in the market; but, unlike  the commission agents, they do not have physical control of the product. The  main function of a broker is to bring together buyers and sellers on the same  platform for negotiations. Their charge is called brokerage. They may claim  brokerage from the buyer, the seller or both, depending on the market situation  and the service rendered. They render valuable service to the prospective  buyers and sellers, for they have complete knowledge of the market – of the quantity  available and the prevailing prices.<br />
                  Brokers  have no establishment in the market. They simply wander about in the market and  render services to clients. There is no risk to them. They do not render any  other service except to bring the buyers and sellers on the same platform. In  most regulated markets, brokers do not play any role because goods are sold by  open auction. Their number in foodgrain marketing trade is decreasing. But they  still play a valuable role in the marketing of other agricultural commodities,  such as gur, sugar, edible oil, cotton seed and chillies.<br />
  <strong>(c) Speculative Middlemen</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Those  middlemen who take title to the product with a view to making a profit on it  are called speculative middlemen. They are not regular buyers or sellers of  produce. They specialize in risk-taking. They buy at low prices when arrivals  are substantial and sell in the off-season when prices are high. They do the  minimum handling of goods. They make profit from short-run as well as long-run  price fluctuations.</p>
                <p><strong>(d) Processors</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Processors  carry on their business either on their own or on custom basis. Some processors  employ agents to buy for them in the producing areas, store the produce and  process it throughout the year on continuous basis. They also engage in advertising  activity to create a demand for their processed products.<br />
                  <strong>(e) Facilitative Middlemen</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Some  middlemen do not buy and sell directly but assist in the marketing process.  Marketing can take place even if they are not active. But the efficiency of the  system increases when they engage in business. These middlemen receive their  income in the form of fees or service charges from those who use their  services. The important facilitative middlemen are:<br />
                  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hamals  or Labourers:</strong> They physically move the goods in marketplace. They do  unloading from the loading on to bullock carts or trucks. They assist in  weighing the bags. They perform cleaning, sieving, and refilling jobs and  stitch the bags. Hamals are the hub of the marketing wheel. Without their  active co-operation, the marketing system would not function smoothly.<br />
                  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weighmen:</strong> They facilitate the correct weighment of the produce. They use a pan balance  when quantity is small. Generally, the scalebeam balance is used. They get  payment for their service through the commission agent. The weighbridge system  of weighing also exists in big markets.<br />
                  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graders:</strong> These middlemen sort out the product into different grades, based on some  defined characteristics, and arrange them for sale. They facilitate the process  of prices settlement between the buyer and the seller.<br />
                  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport  Agency:</strong> This agency assists in the movement of the produce from one market  to another. The main transport means are the railways and trucks. Bullock carts  or camel carts or tractor-trolleys are also used in villages for the  transportation of foodgrains.<br />
                  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication  Agency:</strong> It helps in the communication of the information about the prices  prevailing, and quantity available, in the market. Sometimes, the transactions  take place on the telephone. The post and telegraph, telephone, newspapers, the  radio and informal links are the main communication channels in agricultural  marketing.<br />
                  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advertising  Agency:</strong> It enables prospective buyers to know the quality of the product  and decide about the purchase of commodities. Newspapers, the radio, television  and cinema slides are the main media for advertisements.<br />
                  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auctioners:</strong> They help in exchange function by putting the produce for auction and bidding  by the buyers.<br />
  <strong>Marketing Institutions</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketing  institutions are business organizations which have come up to operate the  marketing machinery. In addition to individuals, corporate, co-operative and  government institutions are operating in the field of agricultural marketing.<br />
                  They perform one or more of the  Marketing functions. They assume the role of one or more marketing agencies,  described earlier in this section. Some important institutions in the field of  agricultural marketing are:<br />

                  <strong>PRODUCER’S SURPLUS</strong><br />
                  <strong>Producer's Surplus of Agricultural  Commodities</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>In  any developing economy, the producer's surplus of agricultural product plays a  significant role. This is the quantity which is actually made available to the  non-producing population of the country. From the marketing point of view, this  surplus is more important than the total production of commodities. The  arrangements for marketing and the expansion of markets have to be made only  for the surplus quantity available with the farmers, and not for the total  production. This is because, only a portion of the total production is sold in  the market after personal consumption by the members of farm household and  retention in the farm for several reasons.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate at which agricultural  production expands determines the pace of agricultural development, while the  growth in the marketable surplus determines the pace of economic development.  An increase in production must be accompanied by an increase in the marketable  surplus for the economic development of the country. Though the marketing  system is more concerned with the surplus which enters or is likely to enter  the market, the quantum of total production is essential for this surplus. The  larger the production of a commodity, the greater will be the surplus of that  commodity and vice versa. The knowledge of marketed and marketable surplus  helps the policy-makers as well as the traders in the following areas:<br />
  <strong>i. Framing  Sound Price Policies:</strong> Price support programmes are an integral  part of agricultural policies s necessary for stimulating agricultural  production. The knowledge of quantum of marketable surplus helps in framing  these policies.<br />
  <strong>ii.</strong> <strong>Developing  Proper Procurement and Purchase Strategies</strong><strong>:</strong> The procurement policy for feeding the public distribution system  has to take into account the quantum and behaviour of marketable and marketed  surplus. Similarly, the traders, processors and exporters have to decide their  purchase strategies on the basis of marketed quantity<br />
  <strong>iii.</strong> <strong>Checking  Undue Price Fluctuations:</strong> A knowledge of the magnitude and extent of the  surplus helps in the minimization of price fluctuations in agricultural  commodities because it enables the government and the traders to make proper  arrangements for the movement of product from one area, where they are in surplus,  to another area which is deficient.<br />
  <strong>iv Export/Import policies<em>:</em></strong> Advance estimates of the surpluses of such commodities which have the potential  of external trade are useful in decisions related to the export and import of  the commodity. If surplus is expected to be less than what is necessary, the  country can plan for imports and if surplus is expected to be more than what is  necessary, avenues for exporting such a surplus can be explored.<br />
  <strong>v.  Development of Transport and Storage Systems:</strong> The knowledge of  marketed surplus helps in developing adequate capacity of transport and storage  system to handle it.<br />
  <strong>Meaning and Types of Producer's Surplus</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  producer's surplus is the quantity of produce which is, or can be, made  available by the farmers to the non-farm population. The producer's surplus is  of two types:<br />
  <strong>1. Marketable Surplus</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  marketable surplus is that quantity of the produce which can be made available  to the non-farm population of the country. It is a theoretical concept of  surplus. The marketable surplus is the residual left with the producer-farmer  after meeting his requirements for family consumption, farm needs for seeds and  feed for cattle, payment to labour in kind, payment to artisans – carpenter,  blacksmith, potter and mechanic – payment to landlord as rent, and social and  religious payments in kind. This may be expressed as follows:<br />
                  MS  = P – C<br />
                  Where<br />
                  MS      =  Marketable surplus<br />
                  P          =  Total production, and<br />
                  C         =  Total requirements (family consumption, farm needs, payment to labour, artisans,  landlord and payments for social and religious work).<br />
  <strong>2. Marketed Surplus</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Marketed  surplus is that quantity of the produce which the producer-farmer actually  sells in the market, irrespective of his requirements for family consumption,  farm needs and other payments. The marketed surplus may be more, less or equal  to the marketable surplus.<br />
                  Whether the marketed surplus  increases with the increase in production has been under continual theoretical  scrutiny. It has been argued that poor and subsistence farmers sell that part  of the produce which is necessary to enable them to meet their cash  obligations. This results in distress sale on some farms. In such a situation,  any increase in the production of marginal and small farms should first result  in increased on-farm consumption.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An increase in the real income of  farmers also has a positive effect on on-farm consumption because of positive  income elasticity. Since the contribution of this group to the total marketed  quantity is not substantial, the overall effect of increase in production must  lead to an increase in the marketed surplus.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bansil writes that there is only one  term – marketable surplus. This may be defined subjectively or objectively.  Subjectively, the term marketable surplus refers to theoretical surplus  available for sale with the producer-farmer after he has met his own genuine  consumption requirements and the requirements of his family, the payment of  wages in kind, his feed and seed requirements, and his social and religious  payments. Objectively, the marketable surplus is the total quantity of arrivals  in the market out of the new crop.<br />
  <strong>Relationship between marketed surplus  and marketable surplus</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  marketed surplus may be more, less or equal to the marketable surplus,  depending upon the condition of the farmer and type of the crop. The  relationship <br />
                  between  the two terms may be stated as follows:<br />
                  Marketed  surplus <img src="lec02_clip_image002.gif" alt="" width="12" height="37" /> Marketable surplus<br />
                  1.  The marketed surplus is more than the marketable surplus when the farmer retains  a smaller quantity of the crop than his actual requirements for family and farm  needs. This is true especially for small and marginal farmers, whose need for  cash is more pressing and immediate. This situation of selling more than the  marketable surplus is termed as distress or forced sale. Such farmers generally  buy the produce from the market in a later period to meet their family and/or  farm requirements. The quantity of distress sale increases with the fall in the  price of the product. A lower price means that a larger quantity will be sold  to meet some fixed cash requirements.<br />
                  2.  The marketed surplus is less than the marketable surplus when the farmer  retains some of the surplus produce. This situation holds true under the  following conditions:<br />
                  (a)  Large farmers generally sell less than the marketable surplus because of their  better retention capacity. They retain extra produce in the hope that they  would get a higher price in the later period. Sometimes, farmers retain the  produce even up to the next production season.<br />
                  (b)  Farmers may substitute one crop for another crop either for family consumption  purpose or for feeding their livestock because of the variation in prices. With  the fall in the price of the crop relative to a competing crop, the farmers may  consume more of the first and less of the second crop.<br />
                  3.  The marketed surplus may be equal to the marketable surplus when the farmer  neither retains more nor less than his requirement. This holds true for  perishable commodities and of the average farmer.</p>
                <br clear="all" />
                <p><strong>Factors Affecting Marketable Surplus</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  marketable surplus differs from region to region and, within the same region,  from crop to crop. It also varies from farm to farm. On a particular farm, the  quantity of marketable surplus depends on the following factors:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Size of Holding:</strong> There is positive relationship between the size of the holding and the  marketable surplus.</li>
                  <li><strong> Production:</strong> The  higher the production on a farm, the larger will be the marketable surplus, and  vice versa.</li>
                  <li><strong></strong><strong>Price of the Commodity:</strong> The  price of the commodity and the marketable surplus have a positive as well as a  negative relationship, depending upon whether one considers the short and long  run or the micro and macro levels.</li>
                  <li><strong>Size of Family:</strong> The  larger the number of members in a family, the smaller the surplus on the farm.</li>
                  <li><strong>Requirement of Seed and Feed:</strong> The  higher the requirement for these uses, the smaller the marketable surplus of  the crop.</li>
                  <li><strong> Nature  of Commodity:</strong> The marketable surplus of non-food crops is  generally higher than that for food crops. For example, in the case of cotton,  jute and rubber, the quantity retained for family consumption is either  negligible or very small part of the total output. For these crops, a very  large proportion of total output is marketable surplus. Even among food crops,  for such commodities like sugarcane, spices and oilseeds which require some  processing before final consumption, the marketable surplus as a proportion of  total output is larger than that for other food crops.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>(vii)  Consumption Habits:</strong> The quantity of output retained by the farm  family depends on the consumption habits. For example, in Punjab, rice forms a  relatively small proportion of total cereals consumed by farm-families compared  to those in southern or eastern states. Therefore, out of a given output of  paddy/rice, Punjab farmers sell a greater proportion of paddy/rice, Punjab  farmers sell a greater proportion than that sold by rice eating farmers of  other states.<br />
                  The functional relationship between  the marketed surplus of a crop and factors affecting the marketed surplus may  be expressed as:<br />
                  M = f(x1, x2,  x3, x4)<br />

                <p><strong>Relationship between prices and  marketable surplus</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Two  main hypotheses have been advanced to explain the relationship between prices  and the marketable surplus of foodgrains.<br />
                  <strong>Inverse Relationship</strong> <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an inverse relationship  between prices and the marketable surplus. This hypothesis was presented by P  N. Mathur and M. Ezekiel. They postulate that the farmers' cash requirements  are nearly fixed, and given the price level, the marketed portion of the output  is determined. This implies that the farmers' consumption is a residual, and  that the marketed surplus is inversely proportional to the price level. This  behaviour assumes that farmers have inelastic cash requirements.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  argument is that, in the poor economy of underdeveloped countries, farmers sell  that quantity of the output which gives them the amount of money they need to  satisfy their cash requirements; they retain the balance of output for their  own consumption purpose. With a rise in the prices of foodgrains, they sell a  smaller quantity of foodgrains to get the cash they need, and vice versa. In  other words, with a rise in the prices of foodgrains, they sell a smaller  quantity of foodgrains to get the cash they need, and vice versa. In other  words, with a rise in price, farmers sell a smaller, and with the fall in  price, they sell a larger quantity. Olson and Krishnan have argued that the  marketed surplus varies inversely with the market price. They contend that a  higher price for a subsistence crop may increase the producer's real income  sufficiently to ensure that the income effect on demand for the consumption of  the crop outweighs the price effect on production and consumption.<br />
  <strong>Positive Relationship</strong> <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V.M.Dandekar and Rajkrishna put  forward the case for a positive relationship between prices and the marketed  surplus of food grains in India. This relationship is based on the assumption  that farmers are price conscious. With a rise in the prices of food grains,  farmers are tempted to sell more and retain less. As a result, there is  increased surplus. The converse, too, holds true. </p>
