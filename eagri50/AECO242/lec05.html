				<p><strong>Co-operative Marketing</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  establishment of co-operative marketing societies was another step which has  been taken to overcome the problems arising out of the present system of  marketing agricultural produce. The objectives of economic development and  social justice can be furthered by channelising agricultural produce through  cooperative institutions.<br />
            Private agencies dominate the Indian  food grains trade. Farmers complain of the marketing system because they get  lower prices, due mainly to high marketing charges and the prevalence of  malpractices. The efforts of the government to improve the marketing system of  agricultural commodities have been only partially successful in creating  healthy conditions for scientific and efficient marketing. Moreover, the  progress of regulated markets is not uniform in all areas. The need for  strengthening co-operative organization has, therefore, been recognized for the  marketing of the produce of farmers and for making inputs available for them at  the right price and time. The co-operative institutions are expected to  function as competitors of private traders in the market. These organizations  pool the produce of the small farmers having a small surplus to market and  improve their bargaining power. They have also helped government agencies in  the execution of the policy decisions bearing on the procurement and  distribution of food grains and other essential commodities.<br />
<strong>Meaning</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>A  co-operative sales association is a voluntary business organization established  by its member patrons to market farm products collectively for their direct  benefit. It is governed by democratic principles, and savings are apportioned  to the members on the basis of their patronage. The members are the owners,  operators and contributors of the commodities and are the direct beneficiaries  of the savings that accrue to the society. No intermediary stands to profit or  loss at the expense of the other members.<br />
            Co-operative marketing organizations  are associations of producers for the collective marketing of their produce and  for securing for the members the advantages that result from large-scale  business which an individual cultivator cannot secure because of his small  marketable surplus.<br />
            In a co-operative marketing society,  the control of the organization is in the hands of the farmers, and each member  has one vote irrespective of the number of shares purchased by him. The profit  earned by the society is distributed among the members on the basis of the  quantity of the produce marketed by him. In other words, co-operative marketing  societies are established for the purpose of collectively marketing the  products of the member farmers. It emphasizes the concept of commercialization.  Its economic motives and character distinguish it from other associations.  These societies resemble private business organization in the method of their  operations; but they differ from the capitalistic system chiefly in their  motives and organizations.<br />
<strong>Functions</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>The  main functions of co-operative marketing societies are:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>To market the produce of the members of the  society at fair prices;</li>
                  <li>To  safeguard the members for excessive marketing costs and malpractices;</li>
                  <li>To  make credit facilities available to the members against the security of the  produce brought for sale;</li>
                  <li>To  make arrangements for the scientific storage of the members' produce;</li>
                  <li>To  provide the facilities of grading and market information which may help them to  get a good price for their produce;</li>
                  <li>To  introduce the system of pooling so as to acquire a better bargaining power than  the individual members having a small quantity of produce for marketing  purposes;</li>
                  <li>To  act as an agent of the government for the procurement of foodgrains and for the  implementation of the price support policy;</li>
                  <li>To  arrange for the export of the produce of the members so that they may get  better returns;</li>
                  <li>To  make arrangements for the transport of the produce of the members from the  villages to the market on collective basis and bring about a reduction in the  cost of transportation; and</li>
                  <li>To  arrange for the supply of the inputs required by the farmers, such as improved  seeds, fertilizers, insecticides and pesticides.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>History</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  history of co-operative marketing in India dates back to 1912, when the  Co-operative Marketing Societies Act, 1912 was passed. The first Co-operative  Society was formed in Hubli in 1915 to encourage cultivation of improved cotton  and to sell it collectively. In 1918, The South Canara Planters Co-operative  Sale Society was formed in the then Composite Madras Province for joint sale of arecanut.  The Royal Commission on Agriculture (1928) stressed the need for group  marketing instead of individual marketing. The Central Banking Enquiry  Committee (1931) also underlined the need for organized marketing. The XI  Conference of Registrars of Co-operative Marketing also emphasized the need for  cooperative marketing. In 1945, the Co-operative Planning Committee recommended  that at least 25 per cent of the marketable surplus should be channelised  through Co-operative societies within the next 10 years by forming one society  for a group of 200 villages.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The All India Rural Credit Survey  Committee (1954) brought to light the dismal performance of the existing  marketing co-operatives. In a simple of 75 districts surveyed, there was no  co-operative marketing society in 63 districts. In remaining districts only  around one per cent of the total sale of agricultural produce was done through  the societies. The committee suggested the establishment of primary  co-operative marketing societies and linking of credit with marketing. The  First Five Year Plan (1951-56) laid stress on the establishment of agricultural  marketing and processing co-operative societies. In 1958, the National  Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation (NAFED) was established as the  apex body of co-operative marketing. In 1963, the National Co-operative  Development Corporation (NCDC) was set up for promoting programmes relating to  co-operative societies. The Mirdha Committee (1965) recommended that the  membership of agricultural marketing societies should be restricted to the  agriculturists and traders should not be allowed to join agricultural marketing  societies.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dantwala Committee (1966)  stressed the need for co-operation and integration among the various  co-operative organizations after reviewing the pattern of co-operative  marketing, distribution of inputs to farmers and supply of consumers products.  Based on the survey of the co-operative marketing societies in 1968, the  Reserve Bank of India  recognized that effective linking of credit with marketing was necessary. The  All India Rural Credit Review Committee, 1969 also recommended the  strengthening of co-operative marketing, with a view to helping the government  agencies in the execution of price support programmes. There is a multi-state  cooperative marketing Act in place now.<br />
  <strong>Types</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>On  the basis of the commodities dealt in by them, the co-operative marketing  societies may be grouped into the following types:<br />
  <strong>(i) Single Commodity Co-operative  Marketing Societies</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>They  deal in the marketing of only one agricultural commodity. They get sufficient  business from the farmers producing that single commodity. The examples are  Sugarcane Co-operative Marketing Society, Cotton Co-operative Marketing Society  and Oilseed Growers Co-operative Marketing Society.<br />
  <strong>(ii) Multi-Commodity Co-operative  Marketing Societies</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>They  deal in the marketing of a large number of commodities produced by the members,  such as foodgrains, oilseeds and cotton. Most of the co-operative marketing  societies in India  are of this type.<br />
  <strong>(iii) Multi-purpose, Multi-commodity  Co-operative Marketing Societies</strong><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These societies market a large  number of commodities and perform such other functions as providing credit to  members, arranging for the supply of the inputs required by them, and meeting  their requirements of essential domestic consumption goods.<br />
  <strong>Structure</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  co-operative marketing societies have both two-tier and three-tier structure.  In the states of Assam,  Bihar, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka,  Orissa, Rajasthan and West Bengal, there is a  two-tier pattern with primary marketing societies at the taluka level and state  marketing federation as an apex body at the state level. In other states, there  is three-tier system with district marketing society in the middle. At the  national level, NAFED serves as the apex institution. The pattern of the  three-tier structure is as follows:<br />
  <strong>(i) Base Level </strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>At  the base level, there are primary co-operative marketing societies. These  societies market the produce of the farmer members in that area. They may be  single commodity or multicommodity societies, depending upon the production of  the crops in the area. They are located in the primary wholesale market, and  their field of operations extends to the area from which the produce comes for  sale, which may cover one or two tehsils, panchayat samitis or development  blocks.<br />
  <strong>(ii) Regional/District Level </strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>At  the regional or district level, there are central co-operative marketing unions  or federations. Their main job is to market the produce brought for sale by the  primary co-operative marketing societies of the area. These are located in the  secondary wholesale markets and generally offer a better price for the produce.  The primary co-operative marketing societies are members of these unions in  addition to the individual farmer members. In the two-tier structure, the State  societies perform the functions of district level societies by opening branches  throughout the district.<br />
  <strong>(iii) State Level </strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>At  the state level, there are apex (State) co-operative marketing societies or  federations. These state level institutions serve the state as a whole. Their  members are both the primary co-operative marketing societies and the central co-operative  unions of the state. The basic function of these is to coordinate the  activities of the affiliated societies and conduct such activities as  inter-state trade, export-import, procurement, distribution of inputs and  essential consumer goods, dissemination of market information and rendering  expert advice on the marketing of agricultural produce.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cooperative marketing network of  the country includes 27 state level marketing federations 199 district/regional  marketing co-operative societies, and 4398 primary cooperative marketing  societies besides NAFED at the national level.<br />
  <strong>Membership</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>There  are two types of members of co-operative marketing societies:<br />
  <strong>(i) Ordinary Members </strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Individual  farmers, co-operative farming societies and service societies of the area may  become the ordinary members of the co-operative marketing society. They have  the right to participate in the deliberations of the society, share in the  profits and participate in the decision making process.<br />
  <strong>(ii) National Members </strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Traders  with whom the society establishes business dealings are enrolled as nominal  members. Nominal members do not have the right to participate in decision  making and share in the profits of the societies.<br />
  <strong>Sources of Finance</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>In  1966, the Dantwala Committee estimated a capital base of Rs.2.00 lakhs for a  co-operative marketing society. At 2003 prices, it should be at least Rs.40.00  lakhs. The following are the major sources of finance of a co-operative  marketing society:<br />
  <strong>(i) Share Capital </strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Farmer-members  and the State Government subscribe to the share capital of co-operative  marketing societies. Members may purchase as many shares as they like. They are  encouraged to invest sufficiently in the share capital. They are also persuaded  to invest their dividend and bonus in the shares of co-operative marketing  societies.</p>
                <p><strong>(ii) Loans </strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Co-operative  marketing societies may raise their finance by way of loans from the Central  and State Co-operative Banks and from commercial banks by pledging and  hypothecation and also by clean credit to the extent of 50 per cent of owned  capital.<br />
                  <strong>(iii) Subsidy </strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  Co-operative marketing societies get a subsidy from the government for the  purchase of grading machines and transport vehicles to meet their initial heavy  expenditure. They also get a subsidy for a part of the cost of the managerial  staff for a period of 3 years to make them viable.<br />
                  <strong>Functioning</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  important functions carried out by the co-operative marketing societies are:<br />
                  <strong>(i) Sale on Commission Basis </strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Co-operative  marketing societies act as commission agents in the market, i.e., they arrange  for the sale of the produce brought by the members to the market. The produce  is sold by the open auction system to one who bids the highest price. The main  advantage, which the farmer-members get by selling the produce through  co-operative marketing societies instead of a commission agent, is that they do  not have to accept unauthorized deductions or put up with the many  malpractices, which are indulged in by individual commission agents. As there  is no individual gain to any member in the marketing of the agricultural  produce through co-operative marketing societies, no malpractices are expected  to be indulged in.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This type of marketing is not risky  for co-operative societies. But sometimes traders in the market form a ring and  either boycott the auction or bid a low price when the produce is auctioned on  the co-operative marketing societies shops. These tactics of the traders reduce  the business of co-operative marketing societies. Therefore, farmers hesitate  to take their produce for sale in the market through co-operative marketing  societies.<br />
  <strong>(ii) Purchase of Members' Produce </strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Co-operative  marketing societies also enter the market as buyers. A society participates in  bidding together with other traders, and creates conditions of competition. The  commodities thus purchased by a society are sold again when prices are higher.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system of the outright purchase  of the produce by the society involves the risk of price fluctuations. If the  managers of societies lack business experience, they hesitate to adopt the  outright purchase system. In 1964-65, the National Cooperative Development  Corporation recommended that the outright purchase system should be adopted  only by a society which possesses the following qualities:</p>
                <ol>
                  <ol>
                    <li>The  society has a trained manager, i.e., one who is capable of understanding the  intricacies of the trade;</li>
                    <li>The  society is financially sound and has adequate borrowing facilities;</li>
                    <li>The  society is affiliated to a good viable central level society; and</li>
                    <li>The  society possesses processing facilities.</li>
                  </ol>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>(iii) Advancement of Credit </strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Co-operative  marketing societies advance finance to farmers against their stock of  foodgrains in the godowns of the societies. This increases the holding power of  the farmers and prevents distress sales. Generally, societies advance credit to  the extent of 60 to 75 per cent of the value of the produce stored with them.  The recoveries are effected from the sale proceeds of the produce of the  farmer. This function involves no risk to the society. Moreover, it increases  the business.<br />
                  <strong>(iv) Procurement and Price Support  Purchases </strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Co-operative  marketing societies act as agents of the government in the procurement of  foodgrains and other agricultural commodities at the announced procurement or  support prices.<br />
                  <strong>(v) Other Functions </strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  following functions are also carried out by them, depending upon the  availability of funds and other facilities:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>They  assemble the marketable surplus of small and marginal farmers and transport  this surplus from villages to the society headquarters for disposal;</li>
                  <li>They  make arrangements for the grading of the produce and encourage producers to  sell the produce after grading so that they may get better prices;</li>
                  <li>They  undertake the processing of produce;</li>
                  <li>They  make arrangements for the export of agricultural commodities in collaboration  with the State Level Co-operative Marketing Federation and the National  Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation;</li>
                  <li>They  undertake inter-state trade in agricultural commodities; and</li>
                  <li>They  distribute agricultural production inputs, such as fertilizers improved seeds,  pesticides, agricultural implements, and such essential consumer articles as  sugar, kerosene oil and cloth.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>(vi) Integrated System of Co-operative  Marketing </strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>An  integrated programme of co-operative development embracing credit, marketing,  processing, warehousing and storage has been formulated. The important features  of the integrated system are linking up of credit with marketing, development  of agro-processing on co-operative lines and promotion of storage and  warehousing.<br />
                  <strong>Cooperative Processing</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Co-operative  processing is also making good progress in addition to co-operative marketing.  The structure of processing units established in the co-operative sector is of  two distinct patterns, i.e., those which are set up by independent processing  societies, such as co-operative sugar factories and spinning mills and those  which are established as adjuncts of co-operative marketing societies, e.g., small  and medium co-operative processing units, such as rice mills, jute baling mills  and cotton spinning and processing units.<br />
                  <strong>Progress</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Information  on the progress of co-operative marketing societies in India is given  in Table 5.1.<br />

                <p>            The value of agricultural produce  marketed through the co-operative marketing societies increased from Rs.53  crores in 1955-56 to Rs.7871 crores in 1991-92. The produce marketed through  these societies account for 8 to 10 per cent of the marketed surplus. The  important commodities marketed by these societies are foodgrains, sugarcane,  cotton, oilseeds, fruits, vegetables and plantation crops. The progress of  co-operative marketing societies has varied from State to State and within each  State from commodity to commodity. Maharashtra,  Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab,  Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Haryana together account for more than 80 per cent of  the total agricultural produce marketed through co-operatives in the country.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other important function  performed by these societies is the marketing of agricultural inputs viz.,  fertilizers, improved seeds, insecticides, pesticides, agricultural implements  and machinery. Over 70,000 retail outlets of these societies deal in these  inputs. The value of agricultural inputs marketed by co-operative marketing  societies has increased from Rs.36 crores in 1960-61 to more than Rs.2475  crores in 1991-92.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last forty years, the  number of Primary Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Societies increased from  3108 in 1960-61 to 7871 in 1991-92. By the end of March, 1992, there were 2933  general purpose primary cooperative marketing societies, 4938 special commodity  primary cooperative marketing societies, 191 district/regional marketing  societies and 29 state cooperative marketing federations. These apart, there  are 16 commodity-marketing federations, National Agricultural Cooperative  Marketing Federation (NAFED) and National Cooperative Development Corporation  (NCDC) at the national level. The value of produce handled by the cooperatives  multiplied manifold from Rs.179 crores in 1960-61 to over Rs.7100 crores in  1991-92. In addition, these institutions had supplied inputs to their members  for agricultural activities valued at Rs.2475 crores in 1991-92 compared to  Rs.36 crores in 1960-61. The cooperatives have continued to maintain their  share at around 30 per cent in the total fertilizers distributed to the farmers  in India.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cooperatives have constructed  warehouses with a total storage capacity of 13.55 million tones by the end of  March, 2000 compared to 8.0 lakh tones by the end of March, 1961. For specific  commodities viz., cotton and oilseeds, growers societies in cooperative sector  also exist at regional level with state level federations at state level to  deal with the specific problems in marketing of these crops produced in  specific areas. For the benefit of sugarcane growers, there are 231 cooperative  sugar factories in the country which provide marketing and price support to the  sugarcane growers of their hinterlands. The cooperative sugar factories account  for around 60 per cent of the total sugar produced by 408 sugar factories in  the country. In northern states, where private sugar factories dominate the  cane market, there are several cane growers cooperative societies to manage the  supply of cane produced by the farmers to sugar factories. There was also two-fold  increase in cotton spinning and processing societies in the country during the  last forty years.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Gujarat,  Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu,  considerable quantities of the food grains are marketed by co-operative  societies. In Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, 75 per cent of sugarcane, in  Maharashtra and Gujarat, 75 per cent of cotton, and in Karnataka 84 per cent of  plantation crops are marketed by the co-operative societies. However, the  progress of co-operative marketing societies has been far from satisfactory in  most states of the country because farmer-members do not patronize these  societies for the sale of their produce. Instead, they use the services of  commission agents.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of cooperative marketing  is not universal across commodities, sectors and geographical regions.<br />
                  (i) The performance of cooperatives  in dairy and sugarcane sectors is noteworthy. Dairy cooperatives present the  most successful example of cooperative marketing.<br />
                  (ii) The success of cooperatives and  transforming the social and economic landscape of Gujarat  state and some other parts of the country is a testimony of the role of  cooperatives in agricultural marketing in the country.<br />
                  (iii) The role of the cooperatives  in improving the marketing environment for farmers have also been quiet  significant.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the cooperatives as a whole  account for only 10 per cent of the total quantities of agricultural  commodities marketed by the farmers. This share needs to be improved in the  light of predominance of small-scale farmers, technological changes in  marketing practices and as a long-term solution for improving farmer's price  realization.<br />
  <strong>Reasons of slow Progress of Cooperative  Marketing</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  main reasons of the slow process are:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Co-operative marketing societies are  generally located in big markets/towns and quick and cheap transport facilities  are not available for the carriage of the produce from the villages to the  societies;</li>
                  <li>Farmers  are indebted to local traders and enter into advance contracts with them for  the sale of the crop;</li>
                  <li>Farmers  are in immediate need of cash after the harvest to meet their personal  obligations. They, therefore, sell their produce to local traders; they cannot  wait for the time required to move the produce to the mandi;</li>
                  <li>There  is lack of loyalty among members to co-operative marketing societies because of  their poor education and absence of the co-operative feeling;</li>
                  <li>In  some cases rivalries among farmer-members result in indecision, which hampers  the progress of the societies;</li>
                  <li>Members  lack confidence in co-operative organizations, for most of the co-operative  sector enterprises run at a loss;</li>
                  <li>The  societies do not act as banks for the farmers;</li>
                  <li>Managers  of societies do not offer business advice to members;</li>
                  <li>Societies  do not provide facilities of food and shelter to farmers when they visit the  market for the sale of the produce;</li>
                  <li>The  managers of the societies are often linked with local traders and become  impersonal to the needs of a majority of small and marginal farmers;</li>
                  <li>There  is lack of sufficient funds with the societies to meet the credit needs of the  farmers against pledging of the produce brought for sale. Nor do they make an  advance payment of the value of the produce purchased or sold through them;</li>
                  <li>Co-operative  marketing societies are not capable of carrying on their business in  competition with traders and commission agents, because of the absence of  adequate business expertise among their employees; and</li>
                  <li>There  is a lack of sufficient storage facilities with the societies. They, therefore,  try to dispose of the produce soon after their arrival; a fact which results in  lower prices for the farmers.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Suggestions for Strengthening of  Cooperative Marketing Societies</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>The area of the operations of the societies  should be large enough so that they may have sufficient business and become  viable. Most of the societies at present are not viable because of the small  volume of their business.</li>
                  <li>Co-operative  marketing societies should develop sufficient storage facilities in the mandi  as well as in the villages.</li>
                  <li>The  societies should give adequate representation to the small and marginal farmers  in their organizational set-up.</li>
                  <li>The  co-operative feeling among members should be inculcated by proper education by  organizing seminars and by the distribution of literature.</li>
                  <li>In  the selection of the officials of co-operative marketing societies, weightage  should be given to business experience and qualifications. After their  selection, the officials should be given proper training so that they may deal  efficiently with the business of the society. The efficiency should be  rewarded, wherever possible.</li>
                  <li>There  is a need for bringing about a proper co-ordination between credit and  marketing co-operative societies to facilitate the recovery of loans advanced  by credit societies, and make available sufficient finance for marketing  societies.</li>
                  <li>The  societies should-acquire the transport facility to bring the produce of the  members from the villages to the mandi in time and at a lower cost.</li>
                  <li>Co-operative  marketing societies should diversify their activities. They should sell the  produce and inputs, and engage in the construction of storage facilities.</li>
                  <li>Marketing  societies, like the private traders, should provide accommodation and the  drinking water facility for their members when the latter come to the mandi.</li>
                  <li>The  public procurement and public distribution programmes should be implemented  through co-operative marketing societies to increase their business; and</li>
                  <li>The  cooperatives should be made free from government control.</li>
                </ol>

The head office of NAFED is at Delhi, and its branch offices are located at  Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai. NAFED's area of operation extends to the whole  country. It has established branches in all the major port towns and capital  cities in the country.</p>
<strong><br clear="all" />
</strong>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  main objectives of NAFED are:</p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>To  co-ordinate and promote the marketing and trading activities of its affiliated  co-operative institutions;</li>
    <li>To  make arrangements for the supply of the agricultural inputs required by member  institutions;</li>
    <li>To  promote inter-state and international trade in agricultural and other  commodities; and</li>
    <li>To  act as an agent of the government for the purchase, sale, storage and  distribution of agricultural products and inputs.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p><strong>Activities</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  NAFED performs the following activities:<br />
  <strong>(a) Internal Trade</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>NAFED  is engaged in interstate trade in agricultural commodities, particularly  foodgrains, pulses, oilseeds, cotton, jute, species, fruits, vegetables and  eggs with a view to assuring better prices to the producers. The objectives of  internal trade operations are both the market support to farmers and  maintaining steady supply of commodities to consumers of reasonable prices.  NAFED purchases agricultural commodities through the co-operatives, public  sector organizations and state agencies. Turn over of NAFED over five years  period from 2004-05 is presented in Fig. 5.1<br />
