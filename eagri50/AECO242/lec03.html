				<p><strong>Marketing  Channel</strong><br />
				  <strong>            </strong>In  this chapter, we discuss marketing agencies, marketing institutions and  marketing channels through which farm products move from producers to consumers.  A very small proportion of farm produce moves directly from farmers to  consumers. Most of the farm products move to consumers through several  agencies/institutions and channels. The role played by marketing agencies and  institutions in the marketing system in quite indispensable as these perform  important marketing functions. They also help in expanding the markets for farm  products and add value to the products.<br />
				  The production of a produce is  complete only when it reaches the hands of those who need it – the consumers.  All the commodities cannot be produced in all the areas because of variations  in agro-climatic conditions. Hence, there is a need for their movement from  producers to consumers.<br />
				  There are two main routes through  which agricultural commodities reach the consumers:<br />
				  <strong>(i) Direct Route:</strong> Sometimes,  agricultural commodities directly pass from producers to consumers. There is a  complete absence of middlemen or intermediaries. But it is only a very small  proportion of the agricultural commodities which moves directly from producers  to consumers.<br />
				  <strong>(ii) Indirect Route:</strong> Agricultural commodities generally move from producers to consumers through  intermediaries or middlemen. The number of intermediaries may vary from one to  many. In the modern era of specialized production, both the horizontal and  vertical distance between the producer and the consumer has increased,  resulting in a reduction of direct sales. The role of market middlemen has  increased in the recent past because a substantial part of the produce moves  through them.<br />
				  The  role, functions and other details of some of these institutions have been  discussed in relevant chapters.<br />
  <strong>Marketing Channels</strong><br />
				  Marketing  channels are routes through which agricultural products move from producers to  consumers. The length of the channel varies from commodity to commodity,  depending on the quantity to be moved, the form of consumer demand and degree  of regional specialization in production.<br />
  <strong>Definition</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>A  marketing channel may be defined in different ways according to Moore <em>et al</em>., the chain of intermediaries  through whom the various foodgrains pass from producers to consumers  constitutes their marketing channels. Kohls and Uhl have defined marketing  channel as alternative routes of product flows from producers to consumers.<br />
  <strong>Factors Affecting Length of Marketing  Channels</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Marketing  channels for agricultural products vary from product to product, country to  country, lot to lot and time to time. For example, the marketing channels for  fruits are different from those for foodgrains. Packagers play a crucial role  in the marketing of fruits. The level of the development of a society or  country determines the final form in which consumers demand the product. For  example, consumers in developed countries demand more processed foods in a  packed form. Wheat has to be supplied in the form of bread. Most enables have  to be cooked and packed properly before they reach the consumers. Processors  play a dominant role in such societies. In developing countries like India,  However, most foodgrains are purchased by consumers in the raw form and  processing is done at the consumer's level. Again, the lots originating at  small farms follow different route or channels from the one originating in  large farms. For example, small farms usually sell their produce to village  traders; it may or may not enter the main market. But large farms usually sell  their produce in the main market, where it goes into the hands of wholesalers.  The produce sold immediately after the harvest usually follows longer channel  than the one sold in later months.<br />
				  With the expansion in transportation  and communication network, changes in the structure of demand and the  development of markets, marketing channels for farm products in India have  undergone a considerable change, both in terms of length and quality.<br />
  <strong>Marketing Channels for Cereals</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Marketing  channels for various cereals in India are more or less similar, except the  channel for paddy (or rice) where rice millers come into the picture. For pulse  crops, <em>dal</em> mills appear prominently  in the channel. The flow chart in Fig.5.1 enables us to know the marketing  channels for general food grains in India.<br />
				  Some common marketing channels for  wheat have been identified as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Farmer <img src="lec03_clip_image001.gif" alt="" width="255" height="12" />  consumers;</li>
                  <li>Farmer <img src="lec03_clip_image002.gif" alt="" width="75" height="12" /> retailer or village trader <img src="lec03_clip_image002_0000.gif" alt="" width="75" height="12" /> consumer;</li>
                  <li>Farmer <img src="lec03_clip_image003.gif" alt="" width="75" height="12" /> wholesaler <img src="lec03_clip_image004.gif" alt="" width="42" height="12" /> retailer <img src="lec03_clip_image003_0000.gif" alt="" width="75" height="12" /> consumer;</li>
                  <li>Farmer <img src="lec03_clip_image005.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> village trader <img src="lec03_clip_image005_0000.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> wholesaler <img src="lec03_clip_image005_0001.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> retailer <img src="lec03_clip_image005_0002.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> consumer;</li>
                  <li>Farmer <img src="lec03_clip_image006.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> co-operative marketing society <img src="lec03_clip_image006_0000.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> retailer <img src="lec03_clip_image006_0001.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> consumer;</li>
                  <li>Farmer <img src="lec03_clip_image007.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> Govt. agency (FCI, etc.) <img src="lec03_clip_image007_0000.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> fair price shop <img src="lec03_clip_image007_0001.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> consumer;</li>
                  <li>Farmer <img src="lec03_clip_image008.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> wholesaler <img src="lec03_clip_image008_0000.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> flour miller <img src="lec03_clip_image008_0001.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> retailer <img src="lec03_clip_image008_0002.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> consumer.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The  channels for paddy-rice and pulses are broadly the same, except that the rice  millers or <em>dal </em>millers come into the  picture before the produce reaches retailers or consumers.<br />
                  <strong>Marketing Channels for Oilseeds</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Marketing  channels for oilseeds are different from those for foodgrains, mainly because  the extraction of oil from oilseeds is an important marketing function of  oilseeds. The flow chart in Fig.5.2 reveals the movement of oilseeds from  producers to consumers in India.<br />
                The most common marketing channels  for oilseeds in India are:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Producer to consumer (who either directly  consumes the oilseeds or gets it processed on custom basis);</li>
                  <li>Producer  to village trader to processor to oil retailer to consumer;</li>
                  <li>Producer  to oilseed wholesaler to processor to oil wholesaler to oil retailer to oil  consumer;</li>
                  <li>Producer  to village trader to processor to oil consumer;</li>
                  <li>Producer  to government agency to processor to oil wholesaler to oil retailer to oil  consumer.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Marketing Channels for Fruits and  Vegetables</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Marketing  channels for fruits and vegetables vary from commodity to commodity and from  producer to producer. In rural areas and small towns, many producers performs  the function of retail sellers. Large producers directly sell their produce to  the wholesalers or processing firms. Some of the common marketing channels for  vegetables and fruits are:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Producer <img src="lec03_clip_image007_0002.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> consumer;</li>
                  <li>Producer <img src="lec03_clip_image007_0003.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> primary wholesalers  <img src="lec03_clip_image009.gif" alt="" width="36" height="12" /> retailers or hawkers <img src="lec03_clip_image010.gif" alt="" width="26" height="12" />  consumer;</li>
                  <li>Producer <img src="lec03_clip_image006_0002.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> processors (for conversion into  juices, preserves, etc.);</li>
                  <li>Producers <img src="lec03_clip_image006_0003.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> primary wholesalers  <img src="lec03_clip_image006_0004.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" />   processors;</li>
                  <li>Producers <img src="lec03_clip_image011.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> primary wholesalers <img src="lec03_clip_image011_0000.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> secondary wholesalers <img src="lec03_clip_image011_0001.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" />  retailers or hawkers <img src="lec03_clip_image008_0003.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> consumers;</li>
                  <li>Producers  <img src="lec03_clip_image012.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> local assemblers <img src="lec03_clip_image007_0004.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> primary wholesalers <img src="lec03_clip_image007_0004.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> retailers  or hawkers <img src="lec03_clip_image007_0004.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> consumers.<br />
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>An important feature of marketing channels for fruits and vegetables is that these commodities just move to some selected large cities/centres and<br/>
                  subsequently are distributed to urban population and other medium size urban market centres. The wholesale markets of these urban centres work as transit points and thus play an important role in the entire marketing channel for fruits and vegetables. Large wholesale markets for fruits and vegetables are concentrated in 10 major cities viz., Delhi, Kolkata, Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai, Jaipur, Nagpur, Vijayavada, Lucknow and Varanasi. These cities account for 75 per cent of vegetables marketed in major urban areas in India. Further, the transit trade takes place through the cities with more than 20 lakh population which account for 68 per cent of the fruits and vegetables grown in the respective regions. There are 65 urban wholesale markets for fruits and 81 for vegetables. Each market, on an average, serves a population of about 7 lakhs. </p>
                <p><strong>Marketing Channels for Eggs</strong><br />
                <strong>            </strong>The  prevalent marketing channels for eggs are:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Producer <img src="lec03_clip_image001_0000.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" />   consumer;</li>
                  <li>Producer <img src="lec03_clip_image002_0001.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> retailer <img src="lec03_clip_image002_0002.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> consumer;</li>
                  <li>Producer <img src="lec03_clip_image003_0001.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> wholesaler <img src="lec03_clip_image003_0002.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> retailer <img src="lec03_clip_image003_0003.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" />  consumer;</li>
                  <li>Producer <img src="lec03_clip_image001_0001.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> co-operative marketing society <img src="lec03_clip_image001_0002.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" />  wholesalers <img src="lec03_clip_image001_0002.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" /> Retailers  <img src="lec03_clip_image001_0002.gif" alt="" width="39" height="12" />  consumers;</li>

                </ol>
                <p>Sometimes,  the wholesaling and retailing functions are performed by a single firm in the  channel.<br />
                <strong>Marketing Channels for Pulses</strong></p>
                <p><strong>            </strong>Most  of the studies on the identification of marketing channels for agricultural  commodities have concentrated on a concept of marketing channel which defines  the flow of the produce from the producer (farmer) to the consumer. But as the  commercialization (market orientation) of agriculture is increasing and as the  farmers and consumers are located in different states or different countries,  the marketing channels that are emerging go across state or even national  boundaries. This apart, unless quantities flowing into various channels are  estimated, the relative importance of alternative channels cannot be assessed.  Such an analysis was done by Acharya for gram grains in Rajasthan. According to  this study, there are three points of entry of gram grain in the marketing  channel, <em>viz</em>., farmer level,  wholesaler level (from outside the state) and processor level (also from  outside the state). There are 28 marketing channels, village traders appear in  8 channels, grain wholesalers appear in 18 channels, processors appear in 15  channels, dal (split) wholesalers appear in 5 channels and retailers appear in  15 channels. Assuming the farmers' surplus entering the marketing channel as  100 units, the entry from outside the state at wholesaler and processor level  was 4.24 per cent of the farmers surplus. The percentage quantities moving in  28 channels are given in Table 3.1.

<p><strong>Innovative Marketing Channels (Direct  Marketing)</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>It  has been realized that the marketing channel for farm products which are highly  perishable (fruits, vegetables and flowers) should be as short as possible.  Perishable farm produce should move quickly from farmers to consumers. If  farmers directly sell their produce to the consumers, it will not only save  losses but also increase farmer's share in the price paid by the consumers.  Therefore, direct marketing by the farmers is being encouraged as an  alternative channel. Some examples of these channels are given below:<br />
  <strong>(i) Apni Mandi / Kisan Mandi</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>An  innovative concept of 'Apni Mandi' has been introduced in some states. Apni  Mandi is also called 'Kisan Mandi', as it is different from the traditional  mandi or market yard, where the produce moves to the buyer through either a  commission agent or trader. In Apni Mandi there is a direct contact between the  farmer producer and the buyer who is generally the consumer. This system does  away with the middlemen. In Apni Mandi, farmers sell their produce directly to  the consumers without involvement of the middlemen. The price spread in Apni  Mandi is considerable low. These are working satisfactorily in the case of  fruits and vegetables. These, 'Apni Mandi' are similar to the Saturday markets  of United Kingdom and United States of America.<br />
  <strong>Objectives</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  main objectives of popularizing the concept of Apni Mandi are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>better marketing of agricultural produce  especially of fruits and vegetables;</li>
  <li>ensuring direct contact of the  producer-farmers and the consumers and thereby enhancing the distributional  efficiency of the marketing system;</li>
  <li>increasing the profitability of agricultural  crops for the producers by minimization of marketing costs and the margin of  the middlemen;</li>
  <li>ensuring the availability of fresh fruits and  vegetables and other farm produce at reasonable prices to the consumers;</li>
  <li>removing social inhibitions among the farmers  for retail sale of their produce;</li>
  <li>encouraging additional employment to the  producers and thereby enhancing their incomes;</li>
  <li>promoting rational integration by inviting  the farmers of other states to sell the produce grown by them directly to the  consumers in Apni Mandis of other states; and </li>
  <li>providing  business techniques to the farmers so that in the long-run they may adopt this  practice for other crops and enterprises too.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>History</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  first Apni Mandi was started in Punjab by the Punjab Mandi Board at Chandigarh  in February, 1987. Punjab Mandi Board took the initiative with a view to  providing small farmers around cities a direct access to consumers. Similarly,  in Haryana, the first Apni Mandi was started at Karnal in 1988. In Rajasthan  also, this scheme has been introduced in several district towns. The initiative  is worth emulating.<br />
  <strong>Functioning</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  market committee of the area where Apni Mandi is located provides space, water,  sheds, counters, balances and other facilities to the farmers in Apni Mandis.  The Market Committee Staff need to work hard with dedication for the success of  Apni Mandis. The State Marketing Boards provide financial assistance to the  Market Committees for these services rendered by them to the Apni Mandi. This  scheme is being implemented with certain resistance from middlemen. Some  farmers also have reservations about the success of the scheme as it assumes  adequate skills of retailing on the part of farmers. However, farmers as well  as consumers would benefit from the Apni Mandi Scheme and its popularity may  pick up after sometime.<br />
  <strong>(ii) Hadaspar Vegetable Market</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Hadaspar  vegetable market is a model market for direct marketing of vegetables in Pune  city. This sub-market yard is situated nine kms away from Pune city. This  belongs to the Pune Municipal Corporation and the fee for using the space in  the market is collected by the municipal corporation from the farmers. This is  one of the ideal markets in the country for marketing of vegetables. In this  market there are no commission agents/middlemen. The market has modern weighing  machines for weighing the produce. Buyers purchase vegetables in lots of 100  kgs. or 100 numbers. The produce is weighed in the presence of licensed  weighmen of the market committee and sale bill is prepared. The purchasers make  payment of the value of produce directly to the farmer. The purchaser is  allowed to leave the market place along with the produce after showing the sale  bill at the gate of the market. Disputes, if any, arising between buyers and  sellers are settled by the supervisor of the market committee after calling the  concerned parties. The market committee collects one per cent sale proceeds as  market fee for the services and facilities provided by the committee to the  farmers and buyers.<br />
  <strong>(iii) Rythu Bazars</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Rithu  bazaars have been established in the major cities of Andhra Pradesh state with  the prime objective to provide direct link between farmers and consumers in the  marketing activity of fruits, vegetables and other essential food items. Both  producers and consumers are benefited from Rythu Bazars as producer's share in  the consumers rupee is more by 15 to 40 per cent and consumer's get fresh  vegetables, fruits and food items at 20 to 35 per cent less prices than the  prevailing prices in nearby markets. Further, marketing costs are at the  minimum level as middlemen are completely eliminated from the marketing  activities in Rythu Bazars. The maintenance expenditure of Rythu Bazars is  being met from financial sources of Agricultural Produce Market Committee  (APMC) nearer to the Rythu Bazars.<br />
  Rythu Bazars started functioning in  the Andhra Pradesh State from January 20, 1999. Presently there are 95 Rythu  bazaars operating in all the 23 districts of the state. There is no government  involvement in price fixation. This function is left to farmers who organize  themselves into committees and these committee are fixing sale prices daily  after taking into consideration the wholesale and retail prices prevailing in  the nearby towns. Generally, in the Rythu Bazar, prices are fixed 20 per cent  over the wholesale prices and 15 to 20 per cent less than local market prices.  Prices fixed are displayed at several places all over the Rythu Bazar for the  benefit of the consumers.<br />
  The  major highlights of Rythu bazaars are:</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>District collectors are making the land  available for the Rythu Bazars.</li>
      <li>Permanent infrastructure with all support  system are being constructed in the Rythu Bazars by the concerned Agricultural  Produce Market Committee.</li>
      <li>The vegetable cultivators in the identified  villages are provided the photo identity cards and only these cultivators are  permitted to sell vegetables in these bazaars.</li>
      <li>State Government arranges special buses on  most routes for transport of vegetables.</li>
      <li>Temporary storage facilities are on anvil.</li>
      <li>Coordination exists between revenue,  marketing and horticulture departments for smooth functioning of these markets.</li>
      <li>A distinct and common identity of such  markets across the state is being established.</li>
      <li>Other essential commodities like pulses and  edible oils are also sold in these markets at reasonable prices.</li>
      <li>Vegetable production programme in the area is  also undertaken by the horticulture department of the state to ensure regular  supplies of vegetables to the consumers.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>            Rythu Bazars have generated a great  deal of enthusiasm both among farmers and consumers as farmers get better  prices for their produce due to curtailment of commission and overhead costs on  account of the non-existence of middlemen and the consumers get vegetables at  low prices compared to the prices in other markets.<br />
  <strong>(iv) Uzhavar Sandies</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Uzhavar  Sandies (Farmers' Market) were established in selected municipal and panchayat  areas of the Tamil Nadu by the state government. In these markets, farmers  enjoy better marketing infrastructure free of cost and also receive  considerably high prices for the products than what they use to receive from  middlemen at village or primary markets of towns. Farmers are additionally  benefited in the form of interaction with other farmers and with departmental  personnel. Farmers also get good quality seeds and other inputs in the market  yard itself. The consumers in these markets are benefited by getting fresh  vegetables at relatively lower prices.<br />
  <strong>(v) Shetkari Bazar</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>On  the lines of Rythu Bazars in Andhra Pradesh and Uzhavar Sandies in Tamil Nadu,  Government of Orissa has taken a programme of establishing Krushak Bazars in  the state of Orissa in the year 2000-01 with the purpose to empower  farmer-producer to compete effectively in the open market to get a remunerative  price for his produce and to ensure products at affordable prices to the  consumers.<br />
  The government provides following  incentives for opening of the Krushak Bazars in the state:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provides  1 to 2 acres of land at suitable place, free of cost, for establishing the  bazaar.</li>
  <li>A  cluster/group of villages within the proximity of market area and farmers  growing vegetable are identified having the surplus produce for sale.</li>
  <li>The  identified farmers are allowed to use marketing facilities so that there is no  intervention of middlemen and farmers get better prices for their produce.</li>
  <li>Public  utility facilities <em>viz</em>., drinking  water, electricity, toilet, canteen and rest house are provided to farmers by  the Krushak Bazars.</li>
  <li>Identified  farmers are provided inputs like seeds and fertilizer at the reasonable prices  in the Krushak Bazars, and</li>
  <li>Storage  facilities in the market area are also provided to the farmers in Krushak  Bazars.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(vii) Mother Dairy Booths</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Mother  Dairy, basically handling milk in Delhi, was asked to try its hand in retail  vegetable marketing by direct purchasing vegetables from the farmers, moving  them in specially built vehicles, storing them in air conditioned godowns and  distribute them to the consumers through its retail outlets in 1989 after the  notorious onion and potato price crisis. Mother Dairy management has opened  retail outlets in almost all important colonies of Delhi for providing  vegetables to the consumers at reasonable prices.</p>
<h1><strong>Market Integration, Efficiency, Costs, Margins and  Price Spread</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Market Integration</strong><br />
  <strong>Meaning</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Integration  shows the relationship of the firms in a market. The extent of integration  influences the conduct of the firms and consequently their marketing  efficiency. The behaviour of a highly integrated market is different from that  of a disintegrated market. Markets differ in the extent of integration and,  therefore, there is a variation in their degree of efficiency.<br />
            Kohls and Uhl have defined market  integration as a process which refers to the expansion of firms by  consolidating additional marketing functions and activities under a single  management. Examples of market integration are the establishment of wholesaling  facilities by food retailers and the setting up of another plant by a milk  processor. In each case, there is a concentration of decision making in the  hands of a single management.<br />
<strong>Types of Market Integration</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>There  are three basic kinds of market integration.<br />
<strong>(i) Horizontal Integration</strong><br />
            This occurs when a firm or agency  gains control of other firms or agencies performing similar marketing functions  at the same level in the marketing sequence. In this type of integration, some  marketing agencies (say, sellers) combine to form a union with a view to  reducing their effective number and the extent of actual competition in the  market. In most markets, there is a large number of agencies which do not  effectively compete with each other. This is indicative of some element of  horizontal integration. Horizontal integration is advantageous for the members  who join the group. Similarly, if farmers join hands and form co-operatives,  they are able to sell their produce in bulk and reduce their cost of marketing.  Horizontal integration of selling firms is generally not in the interest of the  consumers of buyers.<br />
            The schematic arrangement of a horizontally  integrated firm is shown in Figure 9.1. In this arrangement, there are four  firms engaged in buying and selling of foodgrains under the direction of the  parent agri-business firm. All the four business firms perform the same type of  marketing function but their locations and areas of operations are different.  Cases of such an integration are very commonly found. Frequently a firm will  have a central headquarter with a large number of local branches that carry on  operations at the local level. Such a network enables the organization to  achieve the economies associated with size of the firm. It also helps the firm  to organize some complex types of operations and services which are needed by  the local units but individually, they may not be able to perform with ease  and/or efficiency.<br />
<strong>(ii) Vertical Integration</strong>         <br />
            Vertical integration occurs when a  firm performs more than one activity in the sequence of the marketing process.  It is a linking together of two or more functions in the marketing process within  a single firm or under a single ownership. For example, if a firm assumes the  functions of the commission agent as well as retailing, it is vertical  integration. Another example of vertical integration is a flour mill which  engages in retailing activity as well.<br />
            The schematic arrangement of a  vertically integrated firm is illustrated in Fig. 9.2. In this arrangement a  firm is not only engaged in grain purchasing and storage of grains but also  owns trucks for transporting the produce from threshing floors/villages to  mandi and vice versa. In addition to trading in foodgrains the firm may also be  processing the grain for making livestock feed which it sells to the livestock  rearers or feed retailers.<br />
            There have been many reasons for the  development of such integrated operations. This type of integration makes it  possible to exercise control over both the quantity and quality of the product  from the beginning of the production process until the product is ready for the  consumer.<br />
            Vertical integration leads to some  economies in the cost of marketing. A vertically integrated firm has an  advantage over other firms in respect of greater market power either in terms  of sources of supplies or distribution network. Vertical integration reduces  the number of middlemen in the marketing channel. It is of two types, forward  or backward, depending upon the stage at which the integration occurs.<br />
            (a) <em>Forward Integration</em>: If a firm assumes another function of  marketing which is close to the consumption function, it is a case of forward  integration; for example, a wholesaler assuming the function of retailing.<br />
            (b) <em>Backward Integration</em>: This involves ownership or a combination of  sources of supply; for example, when a processing firm assumes the function of  assembling/purchasing the produce from villages.<br />
            Firms often expand both vertically  and horizontally. The modern retail stores are a good example of this.  Retailing firms have grown horizontally by expanding either retail stores or a  number of commodities they deal in. They have grown vertically by operating  their own wholesale, purchasing and processing establishment.<br />
<strong>(iii) Conglomeration</strong><br />
            A combination of agencies or  activities not directly related to each other may, when it operates under a  unified management, be termed a conglomeration. Examples of conglomeration are  Hindustan Lever Ltd. (processed vegetables and soaps), Delhi Cloth and General  Mills (Cloth and Vanaspati), Birla Group, Tatas, J.K. Group and NAFED.<br />
            The schematic arrangement of a  business conglomerate is shown in Figure 9.3.<br />
            The conglomerate is involved in a  number of different and frequently unrelated activities. For example, the firm  may be dealing in foodgrains trading; processing of horticultural products;  cloth milling; selling and repairs of electronic equipments; and manufacturer  of vanaspati. Such a conglomeration of activities serves as a means of  spreading the risk and helps in expanding the activities to additional markets.<br />
            Most of the business firms have some  degree of vertical integration, horizontal integration and conglomerate  character. The main objective of such an arrangement is to undertake closely  related activities that will permit them to effectively meet the requirements  of their customers. The most common type of integration which exists in our  rural markets is that a firm which buys and sells the grains is also engaged in  selling of fertilizers, insecticides and pesticides, feed and such other items  with the main objective of meeting the multiple needs of their customers, most  of whom are farmers.<br />
<strong>Degree of Integration</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>There  are two types of integration.<br />
<strong>(i) Ownership Integration</strong><br />
            This occurs when all the decisions  and assets of a firm are completely assumed by another firm. The example of  this type of integration is a processing firm which buys a wholesaling firm.<br />
<strong>(ii) Contract Integration</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>This  involves an agreement between two firms on certain decisions, while each firm  retains its separate identity. When dal mills of an area jointly agree on the  pricing of the dals and processed product, it is a case of contract  integration. Another example of contract integration is tie up of a dal mill  with pulse trades for supply of pulse grains.<br />
<strong>Effects of Integration</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>Integration  is an attempt at organizing or co-ordinating the marketing processes to  increase operational efficiency and acquire greater power over the selling  and/or buying process. Like decentralization, integration in the marketing  process may have both advantageous and disadvantageous effects. Whether a  particular case of integration is advantageous to society or the individual can  be judged by the motive with which it has been undertaken.<br />
            The vertical integration of firms  may be actuated by the following motives:</p>
<ol>
  <li>More profits by taking up additional  functions;</li>
  <li>Risk  reduction through improved market co-ordination;</li>
  <li>Improvement  in bargaining power and the prospects of influencing prices; and</li>
  <li>Lowering  costs through achieving operational efficiency.</li>
</ol>
<p>Horizontal  integration may be actuated by the following motives:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Buying out a competitor in a time-bound way  to reduce competition;</li>
  <li>Gaining  a larger share of the market and higher profits;</li>
  <li>Attaining  economies of scale; and</li>
  <li>Specializing  in the trade.</li>
</ol>
<p>Horizontal  integration in the food industry is limited because of its potential impact on  competition.</p>
<p>Conglomeration  integration may be actuated by the following motives:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Risk reduction through diversification;</li>
  <li>Acquisition  of financial leverage; and</li>
  <li>Empire-building  urge.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Marketing Efficiency</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Marketing  efficiency is essentially degree of market performance. In this sense the  concept is broad and dynamic. It encompasses many theoretical manifestations  and practical aspects. Broadly, one may look at efficiency of a market  structure through the following:<br />
  (i)<strong></strong> Whether it fulfils the objectives assigned to it or expectations from the  system at minimum possible cost or maximizes the fulfillment of objectives with  given level of resources (or costs); and<br />
  (ii) Whether it is responsive to  impulses generated through environmental changes and whether impulses are  transmitted at all levels in the system. Expectations from or objectives  assigned to the system are of critical importance in assessing the efficiency  because various participants have different expectations from the system, which  quite often conflict with each other. For example:<br />
  (i) Farmers expect quick market  clearance and higher prices for their produce. They expect the market to buy  the products when they are offered for sale at reasonable prices;<br />
  (ii) Consumers expect ready availability  of products in the form and quality desired by them at lower prices;<br />
  (iii) Traders and other  functionaries expect steady and increasing incomes; and<br />
  (iv) Government expect the system to  safeguard the interest of all the three sections and in a proportion which is  considered to be fair so that overall long-run welfare of the society is  maximized.<br />
  <strong>Definition of Marketing Efficiency</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  concept of marketing efficiency is so broad and dynamic that no single  definition encompasses all of its theoretical and practical implications. Some  of the definitions are given below:<br />
  <strong>Kohls and Uhl</strong>: Marketing efficiency  is the ratio of market output (satisfaction) to marketing input (cost of  resource). An increase in this ratio represents improved efficiency and a  decrease denotes reduced efficiency. A reduction in the cost for the same level  of satisfaction or an increase in the satisfaction at a given cost results in  the improvement of efficiency.<br />
  <strong>Jasdanwalla</strong>: The term marketing  efficiency may be broadly defined as the effectiveness or competence with which  a market structure performs its designated function.<br />
  Clark: Marketing efficiency has been  defined as having the following three components:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The effectiveness with which a marketing  service is performed;</li>
  <li>The cost at which the service is performed;  and</li>
  <li>The effect of this cost and the method of  performing the service on production and consumption.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of  the three components, the last two are the most important because the  satisfaction of the consumer at the lowest possible cost must go hand in hand  with the maintenance of a high volume of farm output.<br />
  <strong>Efficient Marketing</strong><br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The movement of goods from producers  to consumers at the lowest possible cost, consistent with the provision of the  services desired by the consumer, may be termed as efficient marketing. A  change that reduces the costs of accomplishing a particular function without  reducing consumer satisfaction indicates an improvement in the efficiency. But  a change that reduces costs but also reduces consumer satisfaction need not  indicate increase in marketing efficiency. A higher level of consumer  satisfaction even at a higher marketing cost may mean increased marketing  efficiency if the additional satisfaction derived by the consumer outweighs the  additional cost incurred on the marketing process.<br />
  An efficient marketing system for  farm products ensures that:<br />
  (i) Increase in the farm production  is translated into a proportionate increase in the level of real income in the  economy, thereby stimulating the emergence of additional surpluses;<br />
  (ii) Good production years do not  coincide with low revenues to the producers achieved through effective storage,  proper regional distribution and channelising of latent demand; and<br />
  (iii) Consumers derive the greatest  possible satisfaction at the least possible cost.<br />
  An efficient marketing system is an  effective agent of change and an important means for raising the income levels  of the farmers and the levels of satisfaction of the consumers. It can be  harnessed to improve the quality of life of the masses.</p>
<p><strong>Approaches to the Assessment of  Marketing Efficiency</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Traditionally,  efficiency of the marketing system has been looked at from the following two  angles:<br />
  <strong>(i) Technical or Physical or Operational  Efficiency</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>This  aspect of the efficiency pertains to the cost of performing a function.  Efficiency is said to have increased when cost of performing a function for  each unit of output is reduced. This can be brought about either by reducing  physical losses or through change in the technology of the function viz.,  storage, transportation, handling, and processing. A change in the technique  may result either in the reduction of per unit cost (storage cost for a month,  transportation cost to a distance of 100 kms or the cost of converting 100 kg  of oranges to orange juice) or the increase in the output for a given level of  cost.<br />
  <strong>(ii) Pricing or Allocative Efficiency</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Pricing  efficiency means that the system is able to allocate farm products either  overtime, across the space or among the traders, processors and consumers (at a  point of time) in such a way that no other allocation would make producers and  consumers better off. This is achieved via pricing of the product at different  stages, at different places, at different times and among different users and  hence called pricing efficiency. In simple terms, the pricing efficiency is  achieved when following conditions hold:</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Price  differences between spatially separated markets do not exceed transportation  cost;</li>
    <li>Intra-year  price rise is not more than storage cost; and</li>
    <li>Price  differences between forms of the product (pulse grain and split dal or wheat  grain and wheat flour) do not exceed processing cost.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The  pricing efficiency refers to the structural characteristics of the marketing  system, where the sellers are able to get the true value of their produce and  the consumers receive true worth of their money.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whenever  functions of transportation, storage and processing are performed, cost is  incurred, value is added and the product is priced again. The efficiency of  marketing is concerned with the extent to which the prices (after these  functions are performed) deviate from what the cost of performing these  functions warrant. The pricing aspect of marketing efficiency is affected by  the extent of competition, dissemination of market information and attitude of  the functionaries.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Marketing efficiency in this context  may be termed as the pricing efficiency of the marketing system. The  relationships between marketing costs and marketing margins and that between  gross margins and prices in spatially separated markets between or at different  stages of marketing reflect this aspect of marketing efficiency.<br />
  The above two types of efficiencies  are mutually reinforcing in the long run; one without the other is not enough.<br />
  <strong>Empirical Assessment of Marketing  Efficiency</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Some  simple measures to assess the efficiency of the marketing system for  agricultural commodities are:<br />
  <strong>(i) Ratio of Output to Input</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Conceptually,  efficiency of any activity or process is defined as the ratio of output to  input. If 'O' and 'I' are respectively output and input of the marketing system  and 'E' is the index of marketing efficiency; then<br />
  <center><img src="lec03_clip_image002_0005.gif" alt="" width="81" height="41" /></center>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A higher value of E denotes  higher level of efficiency and vice versa. When applied in the area of  marketing, output is the 'value added' by the marketing system and 'input is  the real cost of marketing (including some fair margins of intermediaries)'.  The measurement of 'value added' is not easy. The difference in the price at  the farm level (price received by the farmer) and that at the retail level  (price paid by the consumers) may be used to measure the 'value added' but it  has limitations mainly because of market imperfections. Assuming that degree of  imperfection is pervasive, this measure has been used to compare the marketing  efficiency of two spatially separated markets, of two commodities or at two  points of time. Consider the following examples of marketing efficiency.<br />
  <strong>Marketing Costs, Margins and Price  Spread</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Market  functionaries or institutions move the commodities from the producers to  consumers. Every function or service involves cost. The intermediaries or  middlemen make some profit to remain in the trade after meeting the cost of the  function performed.<br />
  In the marketing of agricultural  commodities, the difference between the price paid by consumer and the price  received by the producer for an equivalent quantity of farm produce is often  known as farm-retail spread or price spread. Sometimes, this is termed as  marketing margin. The total margin includes:<br />
  (i) The cost involved in moving the  product from the point of production to the point of consumption, i.e., the  cost of performing the various marketing functions and of operating various  agencies; and<br />
  (ii) Profits of the various market  functionaries involved in moving the produce from the initial point of  production till it reaches the ultimate consumer. The absolute value of the  marketing margin varies from channel to channel, market to market and time to time.<br />
  <strong>Concepts of Marketing Margins</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>There  are two concepts of marketing margins.<br />
  <strong>(i) Concurrent Margins</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>These  refers to the difference between the prices prevailing at successive stages of  marketing at a given point of time. For example, the difference between the  farmer's selling price and retail price on a specific date is the total  concurrent margin. Concurrent margins do not take into account the time that  elapses between the purchase and sale of the produce.<br />
  <strong>(i) Lagged Margins</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>A  lagged margin is the difference between the price received by a seller at a  particular stage of marketing and the price paid by him at the preceding stage  of marketing during an earlier period. The length of time between the two  points denotes the period for which the seller has held the product. The lagged  margin concept is a better concept because it takes into account the time that  elapse between the purchase and sale by a party and between the sale by the  farmer and the purchase by the consumer.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The method of calculating lagged  margins is based on the same principle as that involved in the first in-first  out method of accounting. However, it is difficult to obtain data on time lags  between purchase and sale with a view to maintaining continuous series of  marketing margins.<br />
  <strong>Importance of Study of Marketing Margins  and Costs</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Studies  on marketing margins and costs are important, for they reveal many facets of  marketing and the price structure, as well as the efficiency of the system.<br />
  (i) The magnitude of the marketing  margins relative to the price of the product indicates the efficiency or  otherwise of the marketing system. It refers to the efficiency of the  intermediaries between the producer and the consumer in respect of the services  rendered and the remuneration received by them. While comparing the efficiency  of the marketing system by means of marketing margins over space or time, the  difference in the value added to the product through various services/functions  is taken into account;<br />
  (ii) Such studies help in estimating  the total cost incurred on the marketing process in relation to the price  received by the producer and the price paid by the consumer. The cost incurred  by each agency in different channels and the share of each agency in the cost  have been revealed. This knowledge ultimately helps us to identify the reasons  for high marketing costs and the possible ways of reducing them; and<br />
  (iii) The knowledge of marketing  margins helps us to formulate and implement appropriate price and marketing  policies. Excessive margins point to the need for public intervention in the  marketing system.<br />
  <strong>Estimation of Marketing Margins and  Costs</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Regular  monitoring of marketing margins at regional levels are essential for the  formulation and successful implementation of marketing and price policies. A  study of marketing margins should include an estimation of the producers' share  in the consumer's rupee, the cost of marketing functions and the margins of  intermediaries. Marketing margins and costs vary from commodity to commodity,  and depend on the amount of processing involved and the market structure for  handling of the commodity. Even for the same commodity, the margin may vary  from place to place and time to time. A number of factors, such as the method  of assembling, the location of the market and the mode of transportation,  influence marketing costs and margins. The method of sale, weighment and other  facilities, too, affect the marketing costs. Because of a lack of standard  grading in agricultural commodities, it is very difficult to make valid  comparisons of price data. Adequate precautions have, therefore, to be taken  when comparing marketing margins for commodities under different situations.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Inspite of these difficulties,  various studies have been conducted in India to study marketing margins and  costs with a view to assessing the farmers' share in the consumer's rupee and  to suggesting measures for improvements in the marketing system. These studies  have used different approaches, and vary considerably in their depth.<br />
  Three methods are generally used in  the computation of marketing margins and costs.<br />
  <strong>(i) Lot Method</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>A  specific lot or consignment is selected and chased through the marketing system  until it reaches the ultimate consumer. The cost and margin involved at each  stage are assessed. The difficulties or limitations of this method are:<br />
  (a) It is difficult to chase the  movement of a lot from the producer to the ultimate consumer.<br />
  (b) Most of the lots lose their  identity during the process of marketing, because either the product gets  processed or the lot gets mixed up with other lots.<br />
  (c) There is no assurance that the  lot selected is representative of the whole product.<br />
  This method is appropriate for such  perishable farm commodities as fruits, vegetables, and milk, because the lag  between the time the commodity enters the marketing system and time of its  final consumption is very small.<br />
  <strong>(ii) Sum of Average Gross Margins Method</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  average gross margin at each successive level of marketing is worked out by  dividing the difference of the money value of sales and purchase by the number  of units of the commodity transacted by a particular agency. The average gross  margins of all the intermediaries are added to obtain the total marketing  margin as well as the break-up of the consumer's rupee.<br />
  The following formula may be used to  work out the total marketing margins:<br />
  <center><img src="lec03_clip_image004_0001.gif" alt="" width="123" height="51" /></center><br />
  where<br />
  MT  = Total marketing margin<br />
  Si  = Sale value of a product for ith firm<br />
  Pi  = Purchase value of a product paid by the ith firm<br />
  Qi  = Quantity of the product handled by ith firm<br />
  i    = 1, 2, ……n, (number of firms involved in  the marketing channel)<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This method requires considerable  effort in the location and examination of the records kept by the  intermediaries. The main difficulties in using this method are:<br />
  (a) Traders may not allow access to  their account books. It would then be difficult to obtain complete and accurate  information. Moreover, some traders often make manipulated entries in their  account books to evade sales tax and income tax; and<br />
  (b) This method necessitates  adjustment for the difference between the quantities purchased and sole because  a part of the product is wasted during handling.<br />
  <strong>(iii) Comparison of Prices at Successive  Levels of Marketing</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Under  this method, prices at successive stages of marketing at the producer's,  wholesaler's and retailer's levels – are compared. The difference is taken as  the gross margin. The margin of an intermediary is worked out by deducting the  ascertainable costs from the gross margin earned by that intermediary. This  method is appropriate when the objective is to study the movements of marketing  costs and margins in relation to prices and cost indices. The main difficulties  encountered in the use of this method are:<br />
  (a) Representative and comparable  series of prices for the same quality of successive stages of marketing are not  readily available for all the products;<br />
  (b) Adjustment for a loss in the  quality of the product at various stages of marketing due to wastage and  spoilage in processing and handling is difficult;<br />
  (c) The price quotation may not  cover the price of a product of a comparable quality; and<br />
  (d) The time lag between the  performance of various marketing operations is not properly accounted for.<br />
  The following general rules may be  adopted in selection of the method for calculating marketing margins and costs  of various agricultural commodities:</p>

<p>            Irrespective of the method followed,  the following information is required for computing marketing costs and  margins:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data  on prices of the same variety and quality of the commodity at different stages  of marketing, either for one market or for a pair of markets;</li>
  <li>Data  on marketing charges in cash or kind;</li>
  <li>Cost  of transportation of the produce at different levels of marketing;</li>
  <li>Cost  of processing and estimates of the conversion factor from the raw material to  finished products;</li>
  <li>Cost  of all other operations in the marketing process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Various  measures of the price spread and for the computation of marketing costs and  margins, and the procedures followed have been given in the paragraphs that  follow.<br />
  <strong>Producer's Price</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>This  is the net price received by the farmer at the time of first sale. This is  equal to the wholesale price at the primary assembling centre, nminus the  charges borne by the farmer in selling his produce. If PA is the  wholesale price in the primary assembling market and CF is the  marketing cost incurred by the farmer, the producer's price (PF) may  be worked out as follows:<br />
  PF  = PA - CF<br />
  <strong>Producer's Share in the Consumer's Rupee</strong><br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is the price received by the  farmer expressed as a percentage of the retail price (i.e., the price paid by  the consumer). If Pr is the retial price, the producer's share in  the consumer's rupee (Ps) may be expressed as follows:<br />
  <center>PS  = (PF ¸ Pr)  100</center><br />
  <strong>Marketing Margin of a Middleman</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>This  is the difference between the total payments (cost + purchase price) and  receipts (sale price) of the middleman (ith agency). Three  alternative measures may be used.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Absolute  margin of ith middleman (Ami)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ami  = PRi – (PPi + Cmi)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Percentage  margin of ith middleman (Pmi)</li>
</ul>
<p><center>Pmi  = <img src="lec03_clip_image006_0005.gif" alt="" width="147" height="47" /></center></p>
<ul>
  <li>Percentage  mark-up of the ith middleman (Mi)</li>
</ul>
<p><center>Mi  = <img src="lec03_clip_image006_0006.gif" alt="" width="147" height="47" /></center><br />
  where<br />
  PRi  = Total value of receipts per unit (sale price)<br />
  Ppi  = Purchase value of goods per unit (purchase price)<br />
  Cmi  = Cost incurred on marketing per unit<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The margin thus calculated include  the profit of the middleman and the returns which accrue to him for storage,  the interest on capital and overhead, and establishment expenditure.<br />
  <strong>Total Cost of Marketing</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  total cost, incurred on marketing either in cash or in kind by the producer  seller and by the various intermediaries involved in the sale and purchase of  the commodity till the commodity reaches the ultimate consumer, may be computed  as follows:<br />
  C =  CF + Cmi + Cm2 + Cm3 + …. + Cmn<br />
  where<br />
  C  =   Total cost of marketing of the commodity,<br />
  CF  =  Cost paid by the producer from the  time the produce leaves the farm till he   <br />
  sells it, and<br />
  Cmi  = Cost incurred by the ith middleman in the process of buying and  selling the  <br />
  product.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some of the costs are linked with  the quantity marketed and some are linked with the value of the commodity. The  former is a fixed charge, while latter is a variable one. The actual rates of  charges are converted in terms of the weight unit or Rs.100 worth of produce  sold. The <em>ad valorem</em> charges are  calculated on the basis of the actual market price for the physical unit or  Rs.100 worth of produce sold.<br />
  <strong>Farmer's Share and Gross Marketing  Margins</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>According  to Acharya (2003), the gross marketing margins (GMM) can be broken down into  three components viz., cost of performing various marketing functions,  statutory taxes or levies payable in the marketing channel, and net marketing  margins (NMM) retained by market functionaries.<br />
  Marketing cost varies from commodity  to commodity and changes overtime and space. Marketing costs depend on the  perishability of the commodity, need for cold storage facilities, need for  processing before consumption, necessity of storage and transportation,  distance for transportation and nature of packaging needed. The marketing costs  are, therefore, generally high for fruits, vegetables, flowers, oilseeds,  sugarcane and cotton compared to foodgrains. Statutory marketing charges  include taxes and levies (sales tax, market fee, octroi, special duty or cess  on commercial crops etc.) which are paid in the process of transactions of  commodity at different stages of marketing. The rates of these charges vary  from state to state, market to market and commodity to commodity. Most of these  taxes and levies are on <em>ad valorem</em> basis and as such their incidence is higher on high value crops. The market  players have no control on these taxes and levies as these are of statutory in  nature. These statutory charges exert considerable effect on gross marketing  margins and farmer's share in consumer's rupee. Net marketing margin (NMM) is  the amount retained by different market functionaries. The size of net  marketing margin depends on the nature of competition, structure of markets and  scale of business. Larger the net marketing margin, greater is the inefficiency  of the marketing system.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is now increasingly realized that  higher marketing costs do not always reflect inefficiency of the marketing  system. The factors, which cause high marketing costs, could be geographical  localization of production away from the markets, necessity of storage from  production season to the lean season and involvement of processing function in  the marketing process. Under such situations, the size of marketing costs  reflects only one side of the coin and the other aspects viz., consumer  satisfaction is not given any weightage.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over the period, gross marketing  margins (GMM) decreased in foodgrains and oilseed crops due to better  competitive conditions in the trade of these commodities. On the other hand,  GMM increased in fruits and vegetables due to the expansion in the markets for  these crops and their products. As against this, over the period, however,  total cost of marketing in absolute terms have shown an increase due to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>increased necessity of packing all goods;</li>
  <li>increased  availability of facilities of transportation, communication and storage leading  to long distance transportation and storage from production to lean season of  the year;</li>
  <li>widening  of markets due to liberalization of trade and expansion in size of markets  leading to movement of products to distant domestic and foreign markets;</li>
  <li>increase  in the consumer's income leading thereby to higher demand of processed, packed  and branded products;</li>
  <li>increase  in the general price level in the economy thereby leading to increase in the  cost of marketing as many marketing charges are linked to the value of the  commodity; and</li>
  <li>increase  in the statutory marketing charges overtime by the government, which in some cases  account for 12 to 18 per cent of the gross marketing margins.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A  comprehensive review of Indian Literature reveals that studies on price-spread  and marketing margins for the period 1960 to 1975 are available for only a few  crops (wheat, rice, sorghum, pearl millet, chickpea and groundnut). However, in  the later period i.e., 1975-2000 the studies have covered almost all  agricultural products – foodgrains, oilseeds, cotton, fruits, vegetables and  flowers. (For a summary of results see Acharya, 2003).<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is ample evidence of large  variability of the producers share in consumer rupee as well as marketing  margins and costs across the crops and study areas. Disregarding the  extremities, the farmers share in consumers rupee has been estimated as 56 to  89 per cent for paddy, 77 to 85 per cent for wheat, 72 to 86 per cent for  coarse grains, 79 to 86 per cent for pulses and 40 to 85 per cent for oilseeds.  The farmer's share in consumer's rupee for perishable farm products (fruits,  vegetables and flowers) is generally lower and varied from 32 to 68 per cent.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The studies in general reveal that  the producer's share in consumer's rupee has varied with the marketing channel  adopted by the farmers. The DMI studies reveal <br />
  (Table 3.2) that the costs were higher when farmers adopted private channels in  marketing of surplus produce compared to the institutional channels and hence  farmer's share was lower when they sell through private channels.<br />

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A recent comprehensive analysis of  statutory charges/taxes and transport and storage costs of wheat by Ramesh  Chand has shown that the mark up over farm harvest price prevailing during  post-harvest season in a surplus state (like Punjab) needed to attract private  sector in wheat trade is 74 per cent to 126 per cent (Goa) for the month of  next March. This implies that for wheat supplied to a consumer in Goa in the  month of next March, the share of a Punjab wheat grower (based on the price  received in the preceding harvest month of May) in the consumer's price is 44.2  per cent. This also means that the statutory charges and marketing costs  (storing wheat from May to next March and transportation from Punjab to Goa  included) add up to 55.8 per cent of the consumer's price.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sale of fruits through pre-harvest  contractors is also common in fruit producing areas. The studies on estimates  of marketing costs and margins reveal that farmers receive a lower price when they  sell through the contractor.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The gross marketing margins in  marketing of agricultural products have also been worked out from National  Accounts Statistics by Acharya, S.S. (1998). In this approach, difference  between the total consumers expenditure on a particular farm product and the  value of the output at the farm level has been used to estimate gross marketing  margin. Based on an aggregate accounting, the gross marketing margin (GMM) as  percentage of consumer's price is 19.2 in cereals, 7.2 in oilseeds, 32.9 in  fruits and vegetables, 6.7 in milk and milk products, and 37.2 in sugarcane  with an overall average of 19.3 per cent for all agricultural commodities. The  estimates are shown in Table 3.3.<br />

  <strong>Factors Affecting the Cost of Marketing</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Studies  on the cost of marketing reveal that there is a large variation in the cost per  quintal or per Rs.100 worth of the produce. The factors which affect marketing  costs are:<br />
  <strong>(i)  Perishability of the Product:</strong> The cost of marketing is directly related to  the degree of perishability. The higher the perishability, the greater the cost  of marketing, and vice versa.<br />
  <strong>(ii)  Extent of Loss in storage and Transportation:</strong> If the loss in the quality  and quantity of produce, arising out of wastage or spoilage or shrinkage during  the period of storage or in the course of transportation is substantial, the  marketing cost will go up.<br />
  <strong>(iii)  Volume of the Product Handled:</strong> The larger the volume of business or  turnover of a product, the less will be the per unit cost of marketing.<br />
  <strong>(iv)  Regularity in the Supply of the Product:</strong> If the supply of the product is  regular throughout the year, the cost of marketing on per unit basis will be  less than in a situation of irregular supply or supply restricted to a few  months of the year.<br />
  <strong>(v)  Extent of Packaging:</strong> The cost of marketing is higher for the commodities  requiring packaging.<br />
  <strong>(vi)  Extent of Adoption of Grading:</strong> The cost of marketing of ungraded product is  higher than that of the products in which grading can be easily adopted.<br />
  <strong>(vii)  Necessity of Demand Creation:</strong> If substantial advertisement is needed to  create the demand of prospective buyers, the total cost of marketing will be  high.<br />
  <strong>(viii)  Bulkiness of the Product: </strong>The marketing cost of bulky products is higher  than that of which are not bulky.<br />
  <strong>(ix)  Need for Retailing:</strong> The greater the need for the retailing of a product,  the higher the total cost of marketing;<br />
  <strong>(x) Necessity of Storage:</strong> The  cost of the storage of a product adds to the cost of marketing, whereas the  commodities which are produced and sold immediately without any storage attract  lower marketing cost.<br />
  <strong>(xi)  Extent of Risk:</strong> The greater the risk involved in the business for a product  (due to either the failure of the business, price fluctuations, monopsony of  the buyer or the prevalence of unfair practices), the higher is the cost of  marketing.<br />
  <strong>(xii)  Facilities Extended by the Dealers to the Consumers:</strong> The greater the  facilities extended by the dealer to the consumer (such as return facility for  the product, home delivery facility, the facility of supply of goods on credit,  the facility of offspring entertainment to buyers, etc.), the higher the cost  of marketing.<br />
  <strong>Reasons for Higher Marketing Costs of  Agricultural Commodities</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Generally,  the cost of marketing of agricultural commodities is higher than that of  manufactured products. The factors responsible for this phenomenon are:<br />
  <strong>(i)  Widely Dispersed Farms and Small Output per Farm:</strong> There are innumerable  producers of agricultural products, each producing a small quantity. Producers are  widely dispersed. Hence the cost of assembling is high.<br />
  <strong>(ii)  Bulkiness of Agricultural Products:</strong> Most farm products are bulky in  relation to their value. This results in a higher cost of transportation.<br />
  <strong>(iii)  Difficult Grading:</strong> Grading is relatively difficult for agricultural  products. Each lot has to be personally inspected during purchase and sale – a  fact which increases marketing costs. The sale or purchase by contract or  sample is not easy because an inspection of each lot of the product is required  by reason of variation in their quality.<br />
  <strong>(iv)  Irregular Supply:</strong> Agricultural products are characterized by seasonal  production. Their market supply, therefore, fluctuates during the year. In  times of glut, prices go down and the cost of marketing functions, on value  basis.<br />
  <strong>(v)  Need for Storage and Processing:</strong> There is a greater need for the storage of  agricultural products because of the seasonality of their production. The  processing of agricultural products is a necessity because all the agricultural  products are not consumed in the raw form. Storage and processing add to the  cost of marketing. Losses of agricultural products in storage are also high  because of their perishability.<br />
  <strong>(vi)  Large Number of Middlemen:</strong> In foodgrain marketing, the number of middlemen  is larger because there is no restriction on their entry in the trade.  Contrarily, there are mainly restrictions on the entry into the trade of  industrial products. For example, the cumbersome licensing procedure, high risk  and high capital requirement make entry into trade in non-farm goods somewhat  difficult. The larger the number of middlemen, the higher the marketing costs.<br />
  <strong>(vii)  Risk involved:</strong> The risk of price fluctuations is higher in agricultural  products. The higher risk leads to higher risk premium, which adds to the  marketing cost.<br />
  <strong>Marketing Cost in India and Other  Countries</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>In  India, the marketing cost of foodgrains is lower than in developed countries.  The factors responsible for this difference are:<br />
  (i) Foodgrains are sold in a relatively  unprocessed form in India, whereas in developed countries, consumers want them  mostly, in a processed form. India, the processing of foodgrains is undertaken  at the consumers' level. Therefore, the cost of marketing is lower, and the  farmers' share in consumer's rupee is higher in India.<br />
  (ii) Human labour is relatively  cheap in India, a fact which keeps the labour component of the marketing cost  lower in India than in the developed countries.<br />
  <strong>Marketing Costs of Foodgrains Over Time</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Over  time, there has been an increase in the marketing cost of foodgrains in India.  Some of the factors which have been responsible for this increase are:<br />
  <strong>(i)  Shifting Tendency from Subsistence to Commercialised Farming:</strong> Previously,  each farmer used to produce foodgrains needed by him; but now, because of  specialization in agricultural production and increasing urbanization, the  distance between producers and consumers has increased. The cost of moving  foodgrains from producers to consumers has, therefore, increased.<br />
  <strong>(ii)  Technological Advances in Preservation and Storage:</strong> Formerly, many food  products were consumed only during the season of production. Specialization in  production and the evolution of short duration high-yielding varieties have  resulted in large-scale production, thereby necessitating their storage.  Technological advances in storage and preservation, though have facilitated  handling of large volumes but have increased the costs and widened the spread  between the producers' and the consumer's prices.<br />
  <strong>(iii)  Change in the Form of Consumer Demand:</strong> There has been a change in the  consumer's behaviour over time. Consumers now like the product in a processed  and ready-to-use form following the increasing impact of urbanization. The  desire for attractive packaging and home delivery system, too, has had its  influence on consumer demand. Their demand for marketing service has,  therefore, increased. <br />
  <strong>How to Reduce Marketing Costs</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>There  are various ways of reducing marketing costs. No single factor can bring about  any perceptible reduction in these costs. However, a combination of factors may  bring about a significant reduction in the cost of marketing. Some ways of  reducing marketing costs for farm products are:<br />
  <strong>(i) Increase the Efficiency of Marketing</strong><br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An increase in the efficiency of  marketing can be brought about by a wide range of activities between producers  and consumers. Some major areas in which improved efficiency may result in a  reduction in marketing costs are:<br />
  <strong>(a)  Increasing the Volume of Business:</strong> By increasing the quantity to be handled  at a time, one can effectively reduce marketing costs and increase marketing  efficiency.<br />
  <strong>(b)  Improved Handling Methods:</strong> The new methods of handling, such as  pre-packaging of perishable products, the use of fast transportation means, the  development of cold storages and an efficient use of labour are some of the  methods by which efficiency may be increased and costs reduced.<br />
  <strong>(c)  Managerial Control:</strong> The adoption of proven management techniques increases  efficiency. By a constant monitoring of costs and returns, the efficiency at  each stage in marketing may be stepped up.<br />
  <strong>(d)  Change in Marketing Practices and Technology:</strong> Changes in marketing  practices and technology (such as sale of orange juice instead of orange,  retailing food services through super markets, and integration of marketing  functions) reduce marketing costs and increase marketing efficiency.<br />
  <strong>(ii) Reduce Profits in Marketing</strong><br />
  Profits in the marketing of  agricultural commodities are often the largest because of the inherent risk at  various stages of marketing. The risk may be reduced by:<br />
  (a) The adoption of hedging  operations, improvements in market news service, grading and standardization;  and<br />
  (b) Increasing the competition in  the marketing of farm products.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A decline in marketing margins and  costs generally benefits both the producer and the consumer. Only in extreme  cases are all the benefits derived either by the producers or by the consumers  (when there is no change in the price received by the producers). Apart from  such cases, the gains in the efficiency of marketing practices are shared by  both. The extent to which these benefits are shared is determined by the nature  or characteristics of the supply of, and demand for, the product. For example:<br />
  (a) If the supply and demand curves  have the same elasticity, producers and consumers share the benefits equally;<br />
  (b) If demand is more elastic than  supply (e.g., for farm products in the short run), the producers get a larger  share of the benefits; and<br />
  (c) If the supply is more elastic  than the demand (e.g., of many farm products over a longer period), consumers  get a larger share of the benefits.<br />
  <strong>Relationship of Farmer's Price,  Marketing Costs and Consumer's Price</strong><br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The farmer receives what the  consumer pays after the various costs of marketing have been deducted. This  residual, expressed as a percentage of the price paid by the consumer (retail  price), is the farmer's share. The farmer's share may be calculated as follows:<br />
  <center><img src="lec03_clip_image009_0000.gif" alt="" width="263" height="41" /></center><br />
  where<br />
  FS = Farmer's share in the consumer  price expressed as a percentage<br />
  RP = Retail price of foodgrains<br />
  MC = Marketing costs, including  margins<br />
  PF = Price received by the farmer<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The  farmer's share in the amount of the consumer's outlay at the retail level is  not static and undergoes change with the change in market conditions. An  increase in the share is taken as an evidence of increase in the efficiency of  the marketing system in favour of the farmer, while a decrease in the farmer's  share is taken as evidence of the fact that middlemen retain a larger share.  The effect of change in marketing charges or costs on the farmer's share are  shown in Fig. 9.4.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In  period t3 (compared to period t2), the farmer's share in  the consumer's rupee has increased because of the reduction in marketing costs  and margins. It is evident that all the factors which bring about changes in  marketing costs affect the farmer's share as well.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several  items of the marketing costs are almost sticky, i.e., they do not move up and  down with the movement in prices. The basic reason for sticky marketing costs  is that many of the items in them are related to the physical volume handled  rather than to the value of the product. For example, transport cost, labour  cost, weighing cost, storage cost and octroi are charged on the basis of  weight.<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With  any given level of sticky marketing margin or cost, the farmer's share (price  received) moves directly with the retail price; that is, if the retail price  increases, the farmer's share also increases. But the proportionate change in  the farmer's share is more than the proportionate change in the retail price.  To illustrate: let the retail price, the marketing costs/margin and the  farmer's price be Rs.100, Rs.50 and Rs.50 per unit respectively in period t1.  Suppose, in period t2, the retail price decreases to Rs.90 per unit,  i.e., a fall of 10 per cent. If the absolute gross marketing margin remains the  same, i.e., Rs.50 per unit, the farmer's price falls to Rs.40 per unit, i.e., a  fall of 20 per cent. In other words, 10 per cent fall in the retail price  results in a 20 per cent fall in the farmer's price. This has been shown in  Table 3.4.<br />

<p>            Another  point that emerges from Table 9.11 is that, in period t1, the price  received by the farmer was 50 per cent of the price paid by the consumer but  that in period t2, the farmer received only 44.4 per cent of the  price paid by the consumer. To the extent that marketing margins or costs are  sticky, the farmers lose more when the retail price decreases.<br />
