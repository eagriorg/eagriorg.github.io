				<p><strong>Administered Prices</strong><br />
                  <strong>Commission for Agricultural Costs and  Prices (CACP)</strong><br />
            Another method of intervention in  the market mechanism has been the announcement of different administered prices <em>viz</em>., minimum support prices,  statutory minimum prices, procurement prices and issue prices. These prices are  announced for different agricultural crops by the Government of India on the  recommendations of Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). This  Commission was originally set up in January, 1965 in the name of the  Agricultural Prices Commission (APC).</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>            The  Agricultural Prices Commission was set up on the recommendations of the  Foodgrains Prices Committee headed by Shri L.K.Jha with the aim of advising the  Government on price policy of agricultural commodities with due regard to the  interests of both producers and consumers. The price policy of the country aims  at evolving a balanced and integrated price structure taking into account the  overall needs of the economy and with due regard to the interests of both the  groups of the economy</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Price Policy</strong><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has formulated a  price policy for agricultural produce that aims at securing remunerative prices  to farmers to encourage them to invest more in agricultural production. Keeping  this in mind, the government announces minimum support prices for major  agricultural products every year. These prices are fixed after taking into  account the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices  (CACP). The Commission of Agricultural Costs and Prices while recommending  prices takes into account important factors, such as:<br />
                  Cost  of production<br />
                  Changes  in input prices<br />
                  Input/Output  Price Parity<br />
                  Trends  in market prices<br />
                  Inter-crop  Price Parity<br />
                  Demand  and supply situation<br />
                  Effect  on Industrial Cost Structure<br />
                  Effect  on general price level<br />
                  Effect  on cost of living<br />
                  International  market price situation<br />
  <strong>Parity between prices paid and prices  received by farmers (Terms of Trade)</strong><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  terms of reference of the Commission were made broad based in March, 1980 with  the change in its name to Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices. Since  1966, the Commission has set up a fairly logical scheme for arriving at the  administered prices of farm products. The Commission has been recommending two  sets of administered prices <em>viz</em>.,  minimum support prices and procurement prices.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices is a statutory body. The  Commission submits separate reports recommending these prices for the kharif and  rabi season crops. The Central Government after considering the report of the  Commission and views of the State Government and keeping in view the demand and  supply situation in the country, takes decision on the level of administered  prices.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission for Agricultural  Costs and Prices (CACP), which was instrumental in evolving a balanced and  integrated price structure in the country, has been manned by several eminent  and experienced agricultural economists. <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main objectives of the Government's price policy  for agricultural produce, aims at ensuring remunerative prices to the growers  for their produce with a view to encourage higher investment and production.  Towards the end, minimum support prices for major agricultural products are  announced each year which are fixed after taking into account, the  recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). The  CACP while recommending prices takes into account all-important factors, viz. <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost  of Production, Changes in Input Prices, Input/Output Price Parity, Trends in  Market Prices, Inter-crop Price Parity, Demand and Supply Situation, Effect on  Industrial Cost Structure, Effect on General Price Level, Effect on Cost of  Living, International Market Price Situation and Parity between Prices Paid and  Prices Received by farmers (Terms of Trade). <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of  all the factors, cost of production is the most tangible factor and it takes  into account all operational and fixed demands. Government organises Price  Support Scheme(PSS) of the commodities, through various public and cooperative  agencies such as FCI, CCI, JCI, NAFED, Tobacco Board, etc., for which the MSPs  are fixed. For commodities not covered under PSS, Government also arranges for  market intervention on specific request from the States for specific quantity  at a mutually agreed price. The losses, if any, are borne by the Centre and  State on 50:50 basis. The price policy paid rich dividends.<br />

                  <strong>RISK IN MARKETING AND ITS MANAGEMENT</strong><br />
                  <strong>Meaning and Importance of Risk</strong><br />
                  <strong>            Hardy</strong> has  defined risk as uncertainty about cost, loss or damage. Risk is inherent in all  marketing transactions. There is the risk of the destruction of the produce by  fire, rodents or other elements, quality deterioration, price fall, change in  tastes, habits or fashion, and the risk of placing the commodity in the wrong  hands or area.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a time lag between the  production and consumption of farm products. The longer the time lag, the  greater will be the risk. The risk associated with marketing cannot be  dispensed with, for this risk contributes to profit. Someone has to bear the  risk in marketing process. But most of the risk is taken by market middlemen,  as they have the capacity to bear it.<br />
                  Whenever risks are greater and  varied, the margin taken by the risk-bearers is higher, and vice versa. One who  holds the commodity in the process is the bearer of the risk, because of which  he may be better off or worse off.<br />
                  <strong>Types of Risk in Marketing</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  risks associated with the marketing process are of three basic types:<br />
                  <strong>(i) <em>Physical Risk</em>:</strong> This includes a loss in the quantity and quality  of the product during the marketing process. It may be due to fire, flood,  earthquake, rodents, insects, pests, fungus, excessive moisture or temperature,  careless handling and unscientific storage, improper package, looting or arson.  These together account for a large part of the loss of the product at the  individual as well as at the macro level. Such losses are a loss to society,  too, and must be averted to the extent possible.<br />
                  <strong>(ii) <em>Price Risk</em>:</strong> The prices of agricultural products fluctuate not  only from year to year, but during the year from month to month, day to day and  even on the same day. The changes in prices may be upward or downward. Price  variation cannot be ruled out, for the factors affecting the demand for, and  the supply of, agricultural products are continually changing. A price fall may  cause a loss to the trader or farmer who stocks the produce. Sometimes, the  risks are so great that they may result in a total failure of the business, and  the person who owns it may become bankrupt.<br />
                  <strong>(iii) <em>Institutional Risks</em>:</strong> These risks include the risks arising out  of a change in the government's policy, in tariffs and tax laws, in the movement  restrictions, statutory price controls and the imposition of levies.<br />
                  <strong>Minimization of Risk</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  agencies engaged in marketing activities worry about the risk associated at  every stage; and they continually try to minimize the effects of these risks. A  risk cannot be eliminated because it also carries profit. The agencies which do  not take risks hardly earn profit. The risk management by the adoption of some  of the measures listed below may minimize the risks:<br />
                  <strong>1. Reduction in Physical Loss</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  physical loss of a product (quantity and quality both) may be reduced by the  adoption of the following measures:<br />
                  (a) Use of fire-proof materials in  the storage structures to prevent accidents due to fire;<br />
                  (b) Use of improved storage  structures and giving necessary pre-storage treatment to the product to prevent  losses in quality and quantity arising out of excessive moisture, temperature,  attacks by insects and pests, fungus and rodents;<br />
                  (c) Use of better and quicker  transportation methods and proper handling during transit; and<br />
                  (d) Use of proper packaging  material.<br />
                  <strong>2. Transfer of Risks to Insurance  Companies</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  burden of physical risk may be minimized by shifting it to insurance companies.  There are specialized professional agencies to bear such risks. They collect  some premium and provide full compensation to the party in case of loss due to  the reasons for which the products are insured. In this way, the company  insures a number of farmers against losses.<br />
                  <strong>3. Minimization of Price Risk</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  risk associated with the variations in the prices may be minimized by the  adoption of the following measures:<br />
                  (a) Fixation of minimum and maximum  prices of commodities by the government and allowing movements in prices only  within the specified range:<br />
                  (b) Marketing arrangements for the  dissemination of accurate and scientific price information to all sections of  society over space and time. This should include information on market demand,  acreage under a particular crop, estimates of market supply and of the import  and export of commodities;<br />
                  (c) An effective system of  advertising may reduce price uncertainty and create a favourable atmosphere for  commodity;<br />
                (d) Operation of speculation and  hedging. The price risk associated with the commodities for which the facility  of forward trading is available may be transferred to professional speculators  through the operation of hedging. A detailed exposition of speculation and  hedging follows.</p>

                <p align="left"><strong>Risk  Management Strategies in Agricultural Marketing</strong><br />
                  <strong>Speculation and Hedging</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Speculation  and hedging are important ways of minimizing price risk in business. In the  former, risk is taken by the person specializing in the business without much  consideration of business trends, while in the second, a calculated risk is  taken.<br />
                  <strong>Speculation</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  fundamental idea underlying speculation is the purchase or sale of a commodity  at the present price with the object of sale or purchase at some future date at  a favourable price. The speculator is normally concerned with profit-making  from price movements. He purchases when prices are low. He is, therefore, not a  normal or regular trader. The difference in the prices prevailing at two times  constitutes his profit. Speculator may lose in this process. The essentials of  a speculator are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>He enters the trade at current prices;</li>
                  <li>The  transactions of speculators are completed on some future date;</li>
                  <li>The  speculators enter the trade with the sole object of making profit from price  movements. Sometimes, they indulge in hoarding as well;</li>
                  <li>Except  in a few cases, the physical delivery of produce is neither taken nor given.  Only the difference in the prices is paid or taken; and</li>
                  <li>Speculators  are not regular buyers and sellers in the market. They do not conduct any  regular business apart from speculative business.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Based  on the legalities involved, speculation is of two types:<br />
                  <strong>(i) Speculation Proper</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Speculation  proper refers to speculation on the part of a person who makes it his  profession. Such professional speculators devote their whole time and energy to  the collection of information about the future course of price movements. The  decisions of the speculator are not hunch decisions. These are intelligent  forecasts based on predicted trends. This type of speculation is beneficial for  the economy as a whole and is usually accepted by the society.<br />
                  <strong>(ii) Illegitimate Speculation</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>This  is a gamble in business. The speculators adopt such manipulative practices as  create conditions of artificial scarcity in the market and lead to a rise in  prices. The main aim of the speculator is to earn a big profit. This type of  speculation is not based on any rationale, though it influences the prices of  products. Such speculation is prohibited by the government in the best interest  in the economy.<br />
                  <strong>Economic Benefits of Speculation</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>(i)  Speculation Dampens Price Fluctuations: Speculators buy at current prices in  anticipation of a rise in prices in the future which results in pushing up the  current prices. This encourages production and discourages consumption. Other  speculators, who sell in the present period in the expectation of a fall in  future prices, bring about a fall in the current prices, which encourages  consumption and discourages production. The sum total of the effects of these  speculative activities results in dampening price fluctuations.<br />
                  (ii) The price differentials in  different markets are bridged to some extent.<br />
                  (iii) Speculation helps in the  adjustment of the supply of, and demand for, commodities at normal prices.<br />
  <strong>Related Terms</strong><br />
  <strong>            (i) <em>Spot/Cash  Transactions</em>:</strong> A transaction in which payment is made  on the spot or within a prescribed short period, and delivery is taken on the  same day or within a specific period are known as spot or cash transactions.  Three things are essential in cash transactions:<br />
                  (a) The purchaser has to take the  delivery of the produce immediately after sale;<br />
                  (b) The seller has to deliver the  goods immediately; and<br />
                  (c) Payment for the produce has to  be made immediately.<br />
                  <strong>(ii) <em>Futures Transactions</em>:</strong> This is a transaction in which prices of  commodities are settled in cash but the commodities are delivered on some  future date as agreed. Generally, in futures transactions, the loss or profit  is paid or received on the expiry of the time instead of the physical handing  over of the commodity.<br />
                  In futures transactions, two groups  of persons are involved, i.e., the bulls and the bears. Persons who expect that  prices will go up in future are bulls; but those who expect that prices will go  down in future are bears. The futures transactions take place as a result of  action on the part of these two groups of persons.<br />
                  <strong>(iii) <em>Contract</em>:</strong> A contract is a promise to deliver or accept delivery  of specific grade of a commodity at a specified time in future.<br />
  <strong>Hedging</strong><br />
  <strong>Meaning</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Hedging  is a trading technique of transferring the price risk. It protects traders from  extreme crash in prices. Hedging has been defined as follows:<br />
                  &quot;Hedging is executing opposite  sales or purchases in the futures market to offset the purchases or sales of  physical products made in the cash market&quot;.<br />
  <em>-     Shepherd</em> <br />
                  &quot;Hedging is the practice of  buying or selling futures to offset an equal and opposite position in the cash  market and thus avoid the risk of uncertain changes in prices&quot;.<br />
  <em>                                                                                                         -      Hoffman</em>:<br />
                  Hedging refers to the purchase or  sale of a commodity in a futures market accompanied by a sale or a purchase in  the cash market. In this approach, each sale is entered into with an  equivalent, purchase of the commodity. It is assumed that prices in the two  markets move exactly parallel, and that the losses arising in one market are  offset by profit in another market. Hedging is based on two assumptions:<br />
                  (a) The future and cash commodity  prices move up and down together, <em>i.e</em>.,  the basis of price changes remains unchanged.<br />
                  (b) The mechanics of hedging  includes the making of simultaneous transactions, but of opposite nature, in  the futures and cash markets.<br />
  <strong>Benefit of Hedging</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  benefits of hedging are:<br />
                  (i) It protects the hedger from  sustaining loss and enables him to earn his normal trade profit;<br />
                  (ii) Hedging enables him to keep the  trade margins at a lower level because there is no risk; and<br />
                  (iii) Hedging facilities the  financing of inventories of stored commodities to the maximum possible extent.<br />
                  Hedging is employed by many traders  to protect themselves against losses due to market price fluctuations by  executing cash purchases and sales practically simultaneously with future  transactions in the opposite side. It is the performance of mainly the two  contracts of an opposite, though corresponding nature at the same time, one in  the spot market where the commodity physically is handled, and the other in the  futures market; where the commodity exchange takes place. In short, there are  two opposite responsibilities balancing each other.<br />
                  One other example should make the  operation and logic of hedging clear. Suppose, a cotton trader contracts a deal  with some overseas firm in February 2010 to supply 1000 quintals of cotton lint  at a price of Rs.4200 per quintal to be shipped in May 2010. In order to  protect himself from a possible loss, he buys cotton futures at a ruling  futures price of say Rs.4210 per quintal. Now in the month of May 2010, he  discovers that the ruling spot price of cotton is Rs.4250 per quintal. As he  had contracted to ship 1000 quintals at a price of Rs.4200, he looses Rs.50 per  quintal on this deal. But the future prices also have moved up (say) to Rs.4260  per quintal, in sympathy with the spot or ready or cash prices. Hence, he sells  cotton future at Rs.4260 per quintal (which he purchased at Rs.4210 per  quintal) and gains Rs.50 per quintal. This way, his loss on the spot or ready  or cash market is compensated by the gain in futures market.<br />
  <strong>Difference between Speculation and  Hedging</strong><br />

                <p><strong>Futures Trading</strong><br />
                  <strong>Meaning</strong><br />
                  Futures trading is a device for protection  against the price fluctuations which normally arise in the course of the  marketing of commodities. Stockists, processors or manufacturers utilize the  futures contracts to transfer the price risk faced by them.<br />
                  Futures trading includes both  hedging and speculation. But since hedging is its <em>raison deter</em>, it is  also known as hedge-trading. Futures markets are, therefore, known as  &quot;hedge&quot; markets.<br />
                  Widely divergent views exist on the  effects of futures trading. A few are convinced that commodity futures trading  tend to stabilize prices and reduce price variations. Others not only disagree  with this view but vigorously allege that, more often than not, futures trading  aggravate the price trends and increase both the magnitude and frequency of  price variations. A third group denies that futures trading have any influence,  either favourable or adverse, on commodity prices.<br />
                  Futures trading in various groups of  commodities was established about the end of 19th century. In  cotton, futures trading was started in Bombay. The Europeans took a hand in  founding the Bombay Cotton Traders Association in 1875 for the regulation of  cotton trade, which was the first step in the evolution of an organized futures  market. The futures markets were established for oilseeds at Bombay in 1900,  for wheat at Hapur in 1913, for raw jute and jute goods at Kolkata in 1912, and  for bullion at Mumbai in 1920. Subsequently, similar markets for these  commodities were established at other places also. To provide against unhealthy  speculation, forward trading in agricultural commodities was regulated under  the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952. The Act was enacted with a view  to regulating forward contracts prohibiting options in goods and dealing with  certain other related matters. This job has been assigned to the Forward Market  Commission, which was established in September, 1953. The government has  regulated or banned forward trading in several commodities in order to check  unhealthy speculation. The Act has been amended from time to time to plug the  loopholes.<br />
                  The Forward Markets Review  Committee, set up by the Government of India under the chairmanship of Prof.  M.L.Dantwala, recognized the need for futures trading even in conditions of  short supply, and upheld the view that speculations in futures markets should  be recognized as a necessary factor for their proper working.</p>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Commodities for Futures Trading</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  commodities permissible under futures trading must satisfy the following  conditions:<br />
                  (i) Commodities should be in plentiful  supply. If a commodity is in short supply, a few traders may corner the whole  supply and charge any price they like to the buyers.<br />
                  (ii) The commodity must have a  minimum degree of perishability, i.e., it must be storable for futures  delivery.<br />
                  (iii) The commodity should be  homogeneous and capable of being graded so that its future deliveries may be  made without problems regarding quality.<br />
                  (iv) The commodity should have a  large demand from a number of independent consumers so that a single buyer may not  be in a position to impose his terms for his purchase.<br />
                  (v) The supply of the commodity  should not be controlled by a few large firms. It should be available with a  large number of suppliers.<br />
                  (vi) The price of the commodity  should be liable to fluctuations over a wide range, and<br />
                (vii) There should be free flow of  the commodity to and from the market without any outside interference/control.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Services Rendered by a Forward Market</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  forward market renders the following services to the economic system: <br />
                  (i) It enables the merchants,  stockists and processors to protect themselves against the risk of adverse  fluctuations in the prices of the commodity. It reduces price fluctuations so  that the margin of profit may be small;<br />
                  (ii) The highly competitive  character of the market smoothens out price fluctuations and ensures an even  flow of goods from the purchaser to the consumer, avoiding gluts in the peak  season and shortages in the slack seasons;<br />
                  (iii) It brings about an integration  of the price structure of commodities at different points of time in the same  way as transportation and communications bring about an integration of prices  in different parts of the market;<br />
                  (iv) It facilitates large purchases  and sales of the commodity at short notice in advance of delivery and in the  absence of production; and<br />
                  (v) It brings about a co-ordination  of the current and future expectations by a continual revaluation of stocks of  goods in the light of the changing supply and demand conditions.<br />
                  <strong>Dangers of Forward Market</strong><br />
                  The dangers arising out of the  forward market are:<br />
                  (i) The forward market opens out the  way for a large number of persons with insufficient means, inadequate  experience and information to enter into commitments which may be beyond their  means. In such conditions, market gets demoralized.<br />
                  (ii) It enables unscrupulous  speculators, with little interest in the actual supply of, and demand for, a  particular commodity, to corner the supplies and organize bear raids and bull  raids on the market in the hope of making easy money for themselves. This  results in violent fluctuations in prices.<br />
                  <strong>Forward Market Commission</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  Forward Market Commission (FMC) was established Under Section 3 of the Forward  Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952 and has executive as well as advisory  functions. The functions assigned to the commission are:<br />
                  (i) To advise the government in  respect of recognition or withdrawal of recognition of associations conducting  forward trading.<br />
                  (ii) To keep forward markets under  observation.<br />
                  (iii) To draw the attention of the  government to the various developments that are taking place in the different  forward markets with suitable recommendations.<br />
                  (iv) To collect and publish  information as regards trading conditions in respect of markets falling under  its jurisdiction.<br />
                  (v) To submit periodical reports to  government on the operation of the Act and on the working of the forward  markets, and<br />
                (vi) To inspect accounts of  recognized associations generally with a view to improving the organization and  working of forward markets.</p>
                <p><strong>Contract Farming/Contract Marketing</strong><br />
                  <strong>(Farmer – Processor Linkages)</strong><br />
                  <strong>Meaning</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Contract  farming or marketing essentially is an arrangement between the farmer-producers  and the agri-business firms to produce certain pre-agreed quantity and quality  of the produce at a particular price and time. It can only be a pure  procurement transaction or can extend to the supply of inputs or even beyond.<br />
                  Contract farming is emerging as an  important mode of procurement of raw materials by agri-business firms in India  due to the development in the field of agricultural marketing, changes in food  habits and in agricultural technology in the new economic environment. This is  an important initiative for reducing transaction costs by establishing farmer-processor  linkages in addition to the already existing methods of linking the farmers to  the consumers.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinction between 'sales' and  'contract to sell' needs to be understood clearly. In the case of sale, the  title or ownership of goods is transferred at once whereas in the 'contract to  sell', the goods are transferred at a later date. A contract to sell is not in  the true sense of the word a sale, rather it is merely an arrangement to sell.  A contract is an agreement but an agreement is not necessarily a contract.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contract farming, companies or  organizations engaged in processing and marketing of agricultural products are  entering into contracts with the farmers. They provide inputs to the farmers  and buy back the product at a rate specified in advance. Following type of  inputs and services are normally provided by the company to the farmers:</p>
                <ul>
                  <ul>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Seeds of the variety they need for  processing/marketing</li>
                      <li>Guide lines to grow the crops</li>
                      <li>Pesticides which do not result in residual  toxicity</li>
                      <li>Extension services</li>
                      <li>Fertilizers/harmones required for the crop</li>
                      <li>Other material if not locally available.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  contract may be entered into by parties anytime from the start of the sowing or  planting to the harvesting, processing, packaging and marketing stage of the  crop. Normally, the contract is entered before the start of the sowing or  planting because the buyer can then stipulate the conditions of cultivation,  use of the seed variety needed by them, use of pesticides and insecticides, and  requirement of onfarm grading, sorting, packaging and processing. The buyer of  the product generally keeps the right to monitor the crop at every stage of its  growth.<br />

                <p><strong>Advantages of Contract Farming</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Contract  farming/marketing is beneficial both for the producer-farmers as well as to the  processing company in several ways:<br />
                  To the farmer, contract farming</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Reduces the risk of price/production</li>
                  <li>Ensures  the price as market is assured</li>
                  <li>Increases  the quality consciousness</li>
                  <li>Ensures  higher production because of better quality seeds and pesticides</li>
                  <li>Reduces  marketing costs</li>
                  <li>Provides  financial support in cash or kind</li>
                  <li>Ensures  efficient/timely technical guidance almost free of cost.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To  the processing company, contract farming –</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Ensures supply of quality agricultural  produce at right time and at lesser cost to the company.</li>
                  <li>Canalizes direct private investment in  agricultural activities.</li>
                  <li>Ensures that the toxicity level is reduced as  per requirement for export.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government  is increasingly looking towards the corporate sector to augment the rural  incomes and employment through agro-processing. In this context, policy makers  see the contract farming/marketing as an important avenue to ensure greater  private sector participation in agriculture.<br />
                  <strong>Flip Side of Contract Farming</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The  important weaknesses of contract farming are:<br />
                  (i) Contract farming is involved  mostly in cash crops which may lead to shift in area from food crops which,  beyond a limit may endanger food security, biodiversity and agricultural crops  cycle of the country.<br />
                  (ii) Contract farming may create the  danger of imposition of undesirable seeds.<br />
                  (iii) The temptation of getting  commercial profits from cultivation of a variety of the crop may cause  permanent damage to the land.<br />
                  (iv) Market making outside the  country may cause market breaking inside the country.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, contract farming is a  welcome development. But the contract should be made under high scrutiny  possibly because of exploitation of the farmers. The terms of the contract  should be spelt out in advance and a consent letter is obtained both from the  farmer and the company. The government should establish a monitoring mechanism  and a dispute settlement body to ensure that both parties adhere to the terms  of contract.<br />

                <p>Presently  contract farming is confined to few selected crops in selected pockets.

                  <strong>Incentives for Promoting Contract  Farming</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Contract  farming is means of allocating/distribution of risk between processor and the  farmers. It will succeed if both the parties share the risks and rewards.<br />
                  The Ministry of Food Processing  Industries of Government of India has launched a scheme entitled 'Grant Under  Backward Linkages' to promote contract farming. Under this scheme, a grant of  10 per cent of value of raw material purchased from the contract farmers  (subject to a maximum of Rs.10 lakhs per annum) is provided to food processing  units upto three years. The Ministry has also prescribed a model agreement  form. The criteria for the grant are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The processing unit should provide seed,  insecticides, fertilizers and extension services to contract farmers at  reasonable charges;</li>
                  <li>The  number of contract farmers should be atleast 25;</li>
                  <li>There  should be an agreement prior to the period of contract farming for a maximum  period of one year;</li>
                  <li>The  processing unit should give advance intimation about its contract with farmers  to the Ministry as well as State Nodal Authority (One Month before the contract  comes into operation).</li>
                  <li>The  claim for reimbursement should be recommended by the State Nodal Authority.</li>
                </ul>
