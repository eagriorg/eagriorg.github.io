				<h3 align="left">PROPAGATION</h3>
                <p>Propagation is the process of  multiplying or increasing the number of plants of the same species and at the  same time perpetuating their desirable characteristics. Plants may be  propagated under two general categories: sexual and asexual propagation.<br />
                  <strong>Reproduction by seed</strong> <br />
                  Reproduction by seed is called  sexual reproduction. It requires pollination and fertilization of an egg which  results in seed that is capable of producing a new plant. Seed production  varies greatly among and within weed species in part due to environmental  variability between years, competition from neighboring plants, and genetic  variability. For example, while <em>Canada  thistle</em> has been observed to produce as few as 680 seeds per plant, Curly  dock often produces more than 30,000 seeds per plant.<br />
  <strong><em>Canada  thistle</em></strong></p>

                  </tr>
                </table></center>
                <h3>Vegetative reproduction</h3>
                <p>            In vegetative (asexual)  reproduction, a new plant develops from a vegetative organ such as a stem,  root, or leaf. Several modifications of these organs are common in perennial  weeds, such as underground stems (rhizomes), above-ground stems (stolons),  bulbs, corms, and tubers. Although vegetative structures generally do not  survive as long in the soil as do seeds, very small structures can result in a  new plant. Canada thistle, for example, can produce a new plant from as small  as a 1/4-inch section of root.<br />
                  Vegetative reproduction can be as  prolific as seed production. Yellow nut-sedge (<em>Cyperus esculentus</em>) has  been reported to produce more than 1,900 new plants and more than 6,800 tubers  in 1 year.                 <br />
                  <em>Cyperus  esculentus - tubers</em><br />

                <p>DISSEMINATION / DISPERSAL <br />
                  A plant seed <img width="22" height="22" src="lec03_clip_image009_0001.gif" alt="http://konac.kontera.com/javascript/lib/imgs/grey_loader.gif" /><br />
                  is a  unique genetic entity, a biological individual. However, a seed is in a  diapause state, an essentially dormant condition, awaiting the ecological  conditions that will allow it to grow into an adult plant, and produce its own  seeds. Seeds must therefore germinate in a safe place, and then establish  themselves as a young seedling, develop into a juvenile plant, and finally  become a sexually mature adult that can pass its genetic material on to the  next generation. <br />
                  The chances of a seed developing are  generally enhanced if there is a mechanism for dispersing to an appropriate  habitat some distance from the parent plant. The reason for dispersal is that  closely related organisms have similar ecological requirements. Obviously, competition with the parent plant will  be greatly reduced if its seeds have a mechanism to disperse some distance  away.<strong> </strong>Their  ability to spread and remain viable in the soil for years makes eradication  nearly impossible.<br />
                  Seeds have no way to move on their own, but they are  excellent travelers. Plants have evolved various mechanisms that disperse their  seeds effectively. Many species of plants have seeds with anatomical structures  that make them very buoyant, so they can be dispersed over great distances by  the winds. In the absence of proper means of their dispersal, weeds could not  have moved from one country to another. An effective dispersal of weed seeds  and fruits requires two essentials a successful dispersing agent and an  effective adaptation to the new environment.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>There are two ways of looking at weed seed  dispersal</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the expanding range and increasing population size  of an invading weed species into a new area</li>
                  <li>the part of the process by which an established and  stabilized weed species in an area </li>
                </ul>
                <p>      maintains itself within that area <br />
                  Dissemenation  includes two separate processes. They are Dispersal (leaving mother plant) and  Post-dispersal events (subsequent movement). </p>
                <p><a name="anchor4471933" id="anchor4471933"></a>Dispersal  of seed occurs in 4 dimensions viz. <br />
                  1. Length and 2. Width: Land/habitat/soil surface  area phenomena<br />
                  3. Height (soil depth, in the air)<br />
                  4. Time: shatters immediately after ripening (or)  need harvesting activity to release seed<br />
                  Common weed dispersal agents are  Wind, Water, Animals, Human, Machinery, etc.<br />
                  (a)  Wind <br />
                  Many seeds are well adapted to wind travel. Cottony  coverings and parachute-like structures allow seeds to float with the wind.  Examples of wind-dispersed seeds include common milkweed (<em>Asclepias  syriaca),</em> common dandelion, Canada thistle, and perennial sowthistle (<em>Sonchus  arvensis). </em>Weed seeds and fruits that disseminate through wind possess  special organs to keep them afloat. Such organs are <br />
                  1.  Pappus – It is a parachute like  modification of persistent calyx into hairs. <br />
                  Eg.  Asteraceae family weeds - <em>Tridax  procumbens</em></p>

                <p>Factors that influence wind dispersal </p>
                <ol start="1" type="1">
                  <ol start="1" type="a">
                    <li>seed weight</li>
                    <li>seed shape</li>
                    <li>structures        (wings or pappus)</li>
                    <li>height of        release</li>
                    <li>wind speed and        turbulence</li>
                  </ol>
                </ol>
                <p>(b)  Water<br />
                  Aquatic weeds disperse largely  through water.  They may drift either as  whole plants, plant fragments or as seeds with the water currents. Terrestrial  weed seeds also disperse through irrigation and drainage water.Weed seed often  moves with surface water runoff into irrigation water and ponds, where it is  carried to other fields. Weeds growing in ditch banks along irrigation canals  and ponds are the major source of weed seed contamination of irrigation water.<br />
                  Weed seed often remains viable in  water for several years, creating a &quot;floating seedbank&quot; and allowing weeds  to disperse over large areas in moving water. Field bindweed seed, for example,  remains over 50 percent viable after being submerged in water for more than 4  years. Some seeds have special adaptations that aid in water travel. The  seedpod of curly dock, for example, is equipped with pontoons that carry the  floating seed.</p>

                <p>(c)  Animals<br />
                  Several weed species produce seeds  with barbs, hooks, spines, and rasps that cling to the fur of animals or to  clothing and then can be dispersed long distances. Farm animals carry weed  seeds and fruits on their skin, hair and hooves.  This is aided by special appendages such as  Hooks (<em>Xanthium strumarium</em>), Stiff  hairs (<em>Cenchrus</em> spp), Sharp spines (<em>Tribulus terrestris</em>) and Scarious bracts  (<em>Achyranthus aspera</em>). Even ants carry  a huge number of weed seeds. Donkeys eat<em> Prosophis julifera </em>pods.</p>

                <p>             Weed seed often is ingested and passed through  the digestive tracts of animals. Animal droppings provide an ideal nutrient and  moisture environment for weed germination. While only a small percentage of the  seed remains viable after exposure to an animal's digestive enzymes. The  ingested weed seeds are passed in viable form with animal excreta (0.2% in  chicks, 9.6% in calves, 8.7% in horses and 6.4% in sheep), which is dropped  wherever the animal moves.  This  mechanism of weed dispersal in called endozoochory. Eg., <em>Lantana </em>seeds by birds.  <em>Loranthus</em> seeds stick on beaks of birds.  Viable weed seeds are present in the dung of farm animals, which forms part of  the FYM. Besides, addition of mature weeds to compost pit as farm waste also  act as source.<br />
                  (d)  Dispersal by Man <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man disperses numerous weed seeds  and fruits with raw agricultural produce. Weeds mature at the same time and  height along with crop, due to their similar size and shape as that of crop  seed man unknowingly harvest the weeds also, and aids in dispersal of weed  seeds.  Such weeds are called &ldquo;Satellite  weeds&rdquo; Eg. <em>Avena fatua</em>, <em>Phalaris minor</em>.</p>

                </div>
                <p>(e)  Dispersal by machinery<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weed  seeds often are dispersed by tillage and harvesting equipment. Seeds move from  field to field on the soil that sticks to tractor tires, and vegetative  structures often travel on tillage and cultivation equipment and latter  dropping them in other fields to start new infestation. Disc-type cultivation  equipment is less likely to drag vegetative plant parts than are shovels or  sweeps.<br />
                  (f)  Intercontinental movement of weeds:<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction of weeds from one continent to  another through crop seed, feed stock, packing material and nursery stock. Eg. <em>Parthenium hysterophorus</em><br />
                  (g)  Crop mimicry dispersal<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weed  seed adaptations to look like crop seed: plant body or seed same size, shape,  and morphology as crop. Eg: barnyard grass biotype looking like rice escapes  hand weeding and is dispersed with rice, nightshade fruit (&quot;berries&quot;)  same size, shape as dry beans, harvested and dispersed with beans.<br />
  <strong>(h)  As admixtures with crop seed, animal feed, hay and straw. </strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Weeds probably are  spread more commonly during the seeding of a new crop or in animal feed and  bedding than by any other method. Seed labels often indicate a tiny percentage  of weed seed, but consider this example. If a legume seed contains 0.001  percent dodder (a parasitic annual; <em>Cuscuta campestris)</em> seed by weight,  there will be eight dodder seeds per 2 kg of legume seed. If the legume seed is  sown in a field despite an extremely low dodder seed percentage by weight, the  small size of the seed, combined with rapid early-season growth, could result  in an infested legume field within a single season.</p>
