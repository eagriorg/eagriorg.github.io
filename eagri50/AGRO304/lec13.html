				<p>Selective  herbicides have been used extensively since the introduction of 2,4-D in the  late '40s. They have been one of the miracles of modem agriculture, releasing  thousands of people from the drudgery of hand weeding. A selective herbicide is  one that kills or retards the growth of an unwanted plant or &quot;weed&quot;  while causing little or no injury to desirable species. 2,4-D used in turf will  kill many of the broadleaf weeds that infest turf while not significantly injuring  the turfgrass. But selectivity is a fickle, dynamic process. Excessive rates of  2,4-D applied to stressed turfgrass may injure the turf. Selectivity has always  depended on proper herbicide application. Normally herbicides work selectively  within a given rate of application. Too little herbicide and no weed control,  too much and crop injury may occur. But selectivity is more complex than this.  It is a dynamic process that involves the interaction of the plant, the  herbicide, and the environment.<br />
                  <strong>I.  The Plant</strong><br />
Factors  that involve plant response include: genetic inheritance, age, growth rate,  morphology, physiology, and biochemistry. The genetic make-up of a plant  determines how that plant responds to herbicides and its environment. The age  of the plant often determines how well an herbicide works, older plants are  generally much more difficult to control than seedlings. <br />
            Preemergence  herbicides often work only on plants during the germination process and will  have little effect on older plants. Plants which are growing rapidly are  usually more susceptible to herbicides. The morphology of a plant can help to  determine its susceptibility to herbicides. Annual weeds in a deep rooted crop  can be controlled because the herbicide is concentrated in the first inch of  soil where the weeds and weed seeds are. Weeds with exposed growing points may  be killed by contact sprays, while grasses with protected growing points may be  burned back, but escape permanent injury. Certain leaf properties can allow  better spray retention and thus better kill (broadleaf species vs. grasses or  hairy vs. smooth leaves). Sprays tend to be retained on pigweed and mustard  leaves and bounce off of onion or grass species. <br />
The  physiology of a plant can determine how much of an herbicide will be absorbed  onto the plant and the speed with which it is transported to its site of  action. Plants with thick waxy cuticles or hairy leaf surfaces may not absorb  sufficient herbicide to be injured. Wetting agents in herbicide formulations  are used to combat these leaf characteristics and increase absorption. The  transport rate of herbicides in plants varies. Usually susceptible plants  transport herbicide more readily than resistant ones. Some plants can adsorb  herbicides along the transport pathway, preventing them from reaching their  site of action.<br />
Biochemical  reactions also account for selectivity. Most herbicides have a biochemical  reaction within susceptible plants which accounts for their herbicidal  activity. They may bind to critical enzymes within susceptible plants and block  important metabolic processes (glyphosate), they may block photosynthesis  (diuron) or respiration, or they may affect cell division (trifluralin).  Herbicides may be absorbed as relatively innocuous chemicals (2,4-DB) and activated  to deadly compounds (2,4-D) within susceptible plants. Other herbicides  (atrazine) may be detoxified within some plants (com) while killing weeds which  fail to metabolize the herbicide.<br />
<strong>II. The Herbicide</strong><br />
Herbicides  are quite specific in their structures as to whether or not herbicidal activity  is possible. Slight changes in conformation or structure will alter herbicidal  activity. Trifluralin and benefin differ in only a methyl group moved from one  side of the molecule to the other, yet trifluralin is about twice as active as  benefin. Esters of phenoxy (MCPP etc.) acids are usually much more active than  are amines. The manner of formulation of an herbicide can affect its  selectivity. The most extreme case of this might be granular formulations which  bounce off desirable plants to reach the soil where they then limit germinating  weeds. Other substances known as adjuvants or surfactants are often added to  improve the application properties of a liquid formulation and increase  activity. The manner in which an herbicide is applied can affect its  selectivity. <br />
When a  broad-spectrum postemergence herbicide like glyphosate is applied as a  shielded, directed, or wicked application within a susceptible crop,  susceptible foliage is avoided and selectivity is achieved with this normally  non-selective herbicide. Herbicides can be grouped into families based on the  type of action that they have within affected plants <strong>(their mode of action). </strong><br />
<strong>III. The Environment</strong><br />
There are  many ways that the environment interacts with herbicide selectivity. The soil  determines how much of soil applied herbicides are available for activity.  Sandy soils, with low organic content, are much more active and conversely less  selective than clay soils with high organic content at a given rate of  herbicide application. <br />
Irrigation  or rainfall amount and timing influence the depth to which herbicides may move  in the soil and plant growth and stress, all of which can increase or decrease  herbicide selectivity. Temperature affects the rate of herbicide transport, the  rate of biochemical reactions, plant growth, plant stress, and ultimately  herbicide selectivity. Wind, relative humidity, insects, plant p athogens, and  nutritional status also affect plant growth and stress which can increase or  decrease herbicide selectivity. <br />
<strong>MODE  OF ACTION</strong> <br />
The term mode of action refers to the sequence  of events from absorption into plants to plant death. The mode of action of the  herbicide influences how the herbicide is applied. For example, contact  herbicides that disrupt cell membranes, such as acifluorfen (Blazer) or  paraquat (Gramoxone Extra), need to be applied postemergence to leaf tissue in  order to be effective. Seedling growth inhibitors, such as trifluralin  (Treflan) and alachlor (Lasso), need to be applied to the soil to effectively  control newly germinated seedlings.<br />
 To be effective, herbicides must 1) adequately contact plants; 2) be absorbed by plants; 3) move within the plants to the site  of action, without being deactivated; and 4) reach toxic levels at the site of action. The application  method used, whether preplant incorporated, preemergence, or postemergence,  determines whether the herbicide will contact germinating seedlings, roots,  shoots, or leaves of plants.<br />
<strong>The  herbicide families listed below are grouped on the basis of how they affect  plants (THEIR MODE OF ACTION)</strong><br />
<strong>1.  The Growth Regulator Herbicides</strong> (2,4-D, MCPP, dicamba, and triclopyr). These are mostly foliar applied  herbicides which are systemic and translocate in both the xylem and phloem of  the plant. They mimic natural plant auxins, causing abnormal growth and  disruption of the conductive tissues of the plant. The injury from this family  of herbicides consists of twisted, malformed leaves and stems.<br />
<strong>2.  The inhibitors of amino acid synthesis</strong> (glyphosate, halosulfuron, imazethapyr, and sulfometuron). Both foliar and soil  applied herbicides are in this family. Glyphosate translocates in the phloem  with photosynthate produced in the leaves. Others in this family move readily  after root or foliar absorption. These herbicides inhibit certain enzymes  critical to the production of amino acids. Amino acids are the building blocks  of proteins. Once protein production stops, growth stops. Symptoms are stunting  and symptoms associated with lack of critical proteins.<br />
<strong>3.  Cell membrane disrupters</strong> - with soil activity (oxyfluorfen, lactofen, and acifluorfen). Soil and foliar  applied with limited movement in soil. These herbicides enter the plant through  leaves, stems, and roots, but are limited in their movement once they enter the  plant. Membrane damage is due to lipid peroxidation. Symptoms are necrosis of  leaves and stem.<br />
<strong>4.  Lipid biosynthesis inhibitors</strong> (diclofop, fluazifop, sethoxydim, and clethodim). Foliar applied Diclofop has  both soil and foliar activity. Herbicides in this family move in both the xylem  and phloem of the plant and inhibit enzymes critical in the production of  lipids. Lipids are necessary to form plant membranes which are essential to  growth and metabolic processes. Symptoms include stunting and death of tissue  within the growing points of plants.<br />
<strong>5.  Pigment inhibitors</strong> (norflurazon, fluridone, and amitrol). Soil applied and move in the xylem  except amitrol, which moves in both phloem and xylem. These herbicides inhibit  carotinoid biosyntehsis, leaving chlorophyll unprotected from photooxidation.  This results in foliage which lacks color. Symptoms include albino or bleached  appearance of foliage.<br />
<strong>6.  Growth inhibitors of shoots</strong> (thiocarbamate herbicides including: EPTC, cycloate, pebulate, and molinate).  Soil applied and somewhat volatile, requiring incorporation. Enter the plant  through the roots and translocated through the xylem with the transpiration  stream to the growing points in the shoot. Mode of action is unclear, but  affects developing leaves in growing points of susceptible plants. Symptoms  include stunting and distortion of seedling leaves.<br />
<strong>7.  Herbicides which disrupt cell division</strong> (trifluralin, DCPA, dithiopyr, oryzalin, pronamide, pendimethalin, and  napropamide). All are soil applied, with limited movement in the soil. Absorbed  through roots or emerging shoot tips. Once absorption takes place, movement is  limited (site of action is near the site of absorption). These herbicides  inhibit cell division or mitosis, except pronamide and napropamide which stop  cell division before mitosis. Symptoms include stunting and swollen root tips.<br />
<strong>8.  Cell membrane disrupters</strong> - no soil activity (paraquat, diquat, glufosinate, acids, oils, soaps). These  herbicides are foliar applied with no soil activity. They enter the plant  through the leaves and stems and do not move significantly within the plant  once absorbed. These herbicides either act directly on cell membranes (acids,  soaps. oils) or react with a plant process to form destructive compounds which  result in membrane damage. Symptoms include rapid necrosis of the leaves and  stem. <br />
<strong>9.  Inhibitors of photosynthesis</strong> (atrazine, simazine, metribuzin, cyanazine, prometryn, diuron, linuron,  tebuthiuron, and bromacil). These are soil applied herbicides, however, all  except simazine also have foliar activity. They move readily in the plant in  the xylem with the transpiration stream where they concentrate in the leaves at  the site of photosynthesis. Once there they block the electron transport system  of photosynthesis, causing a build up of destructive high energy products which  destroy chlorophyll and ultimately the leaf tissues. Symptoms include chlorotic  (yellowed ) leaves which become necrotic.<br />
<strong>Herbicide  Resistance</strong><br />
            Herbicide resistance probably develops  through the selection of naturally occurring biotypes of weeds exposed to a  particular family of herbicides over a period of years. A biotype is a  population of plants within the same species that has specific traits in  common. Resistant plants survive, go to seed, and create new generations of  herbicide resistant weeds. <br />
Mechanisms for resistance vary depending on herbicide  family. Resistant biotypes may have slight biochemical differences from their  susceptible counterparts that eliminates sensitivity to certain herbicides.  Also, while photosynthesis is inhibited in triazine herbicide susceptible  biotypes, because of a slight change in a chloroplast protein, triazine  resistant biotypes are able to continue normal photosynthesis upon exposure to  triazine herbicides. The potential for developing herbicide resistant biotypes  is greatest when an herbicide has a single site of action. <br />
Regardless of the mechanism for resistance, becoming  familiar with the herbicide mode of action can help design programs that  prevent the introduction and spread of herbicide resistant weeds. Management  programs for herbicide resistance should emphasize an integrated approach that  stresses prevention. Dependence on a single strategy or herbicide family for  managing weeds will surely increase the likelihood of additional herbicide  resistance problems in the future. Some guidelines for an integrated approach  to managing herbicide resistant weeds are given below. </p>

                </ul>
                <p><strong>Effect of sub lethal dosage</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>When herbicides are applied on the  soil, neighbouring fields may be affected by drift. The high doses of  herbicides applied to previous crop may be harmful to the succeeding crop.  However, these sub lethal doses may be occassionally helpful based on crop and  the herbicide used. <br />
                  Herbicides show stimulatory effects  on crops and toxic effects on sensitive crops even at sub lethal doses. Which  show stimulatory effects are phenoxys, triazines, ureas and uracils. In fact,  2, 4-D was first used for its hormonal effect before its herbicidal properties  were discovered.<br />
                  Phenoxy  herbicides have grtowth promoting activities at lower doses similar to  indolacetic acid (IAA). They are active at the meristamatic tissues causing  increased metabolic activities and cosequently higher grain protein content and  yield. Protein content of wheat is increased by dusting 5g/ha of 2,4-D mixed  with micronutrients like iron and copper. Even higher dose, say 0.5 to 1.3  kg/ha applied to the soil as herbicide before sowing increases the protein  content of wheat. The other crops which show stimulatory effect due to  herbicide application are beans, potato, sugarcane, soybean etc.<br />
                  Among triazines, simazine and  atrazine produce favourable effects at sub lethal doses. They increase nutrient  absorption, chlorophyll and protein content. Simazine at 0.06 ppm increased  nutrient uptake and yield of maize, but at 0.3 ppm concentration the yield  decreased. The sub lethal effects caused by drifts are rarely toxic except to  sensitive crops. Spray drift of 2,4 D causes epinasty on cotton plants. <br />
                  Amitrole  at 10 to 100 ppm sprayed on tobacco or wheat causes chlorosis due to  chloroplast malformation and reduction in chlorophyll and carotenoids. Soil  residues of herbicides appilied to the previous crops may affect germination of  sensitive crops.</p>
