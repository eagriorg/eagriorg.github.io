				<p><strong>LOW  VOLUME HERBICIDES</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Herbicides play an important role in  weed control on agricultural and non agricultural surfaces. They are mainly  applied by sprayers (foliar application) that consist of a herbicide tank, a  pressure generator, spray nozzles, pipes and connectors. Foliar application of  herbicides entails spraying the leaves of target plants during the growing  season with a low concentration of herbicide in a water carrier.<br />
            Among all possible weed control  methods, the use of herbicides is principally associated with risks for human  health and the environment. Because of this there is much discussion about the  use of herbicides. Reduction in use of herbicides will reduce associated risks.  It is expected that herbicide use can be much reduced when herbicides are  applied according to best possible practices i.e. application of minimal doses  of herbicide adjusted to weed, weather, herbicide and sprayer conditions.<br />
             Low volume herbicide application has many  benefits. Besides its cost-effectiveness for the landowner, the low volume  solution is also environmentally friendly. The spray can be applied with a  hand-powered, backpack sprayer or larger, motorized sprayers. <br />
This type of application  method has numerous advantages: </p>
                <ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>With low volume foliar, only the targeted species       are treated. </li>
                  <li>Low volume foliar application is also extremely low       profile. No large trucks, no noisy spray devices, only professional       employees with backpacks. </li>
                  <li>Low volume foliar also allows for a lower       application cost due to the lower volume of mix being applied and is       extremely effective due to the higher concentration of herbicide being       applied to each individual plant. </li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>HERBICIDE MIXTURES</strong> <br />
                  It involves mixing of two or more herbicides  used for effective and economical weed control.<br />
  <strong>Advantages of Mixture</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A mixture will broaden the spectrum of  herbicidal action and kill a variety of weeds</li>
                  <li>It may increase the effectiveness; </li>
                  <li>In a mixture one herbicide may prevent  rapid degradation of the other and increase its efficacy</li>
                  <li>A mixture offers the possibility of  reducing the dose of each of the herbicide necessary for weed control leading  to low residue</li>
                </ul>
                <h4><em>Two types of mixtures</em></h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Tank mixtures made with the desired  herbicides and rates before application eg., Anilophos + 2,4-D EE – rice </li>
                  <li>Ready mix – formulated by the  manufacturer. Ready mix available in the world market eg., 2,4-D+Glyphosate,  Paraquat+2,4,-D, Atrazine+metolachlor, paraquat+oxyfluorfen.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>HERBICIDE ROTATION</strong><br />
                  The  practice of following a systematic, rotational sequence of herbicide used in  the same field to prevent or control formation of herbicide resistant weeds.<br />
                  In a rotational programme a  soil-applied or foliage applied herbicide or both are used in a sequence to  take care of annual as well as perennial weeds.   The choice of herbicide depends on the tolerance of crops to particular  herbicides, type of weed spectrum, intensity of weed infestation, soil and  climatic factors etc., <br />
                  The best rotational programme will  aim at maximum cumulative cost benefit ratio and least residual problems and  least build-up of tolerant weeds.<br />
  <strong>Advantages</strong><br />
                  (i) Helps in  preventing emergence of tolerant weed species (Herbicide is captured in vacuole  and inactivated excluding the herbicide from site of action).<br />
                  (ii) Reduces the quantities of herbicide  required for optimum weed control over the years.<br />
                  (iii) Provides  most effective weed control for the duration of crop growth.<br />
                  (iv) Reduces  the building up of herbicide residue problems.<br />
                  (v) It  offers high cumulative cost-benefit ratio over the years<br />
                  Weed survey and mapping may be done  every year and if any shift in weed flora, appropriate changes in herbicide  rotation should be made.</p>
                <h3>HERBICIDE TOLERANCE AND  RESISTANCE</h3>
                <p><strong>Herbicide Resistance</strong>: Naturally occurring inheritable  ability of some weed biotypes within a population to survive a herbicide  treatment that would, under conditions of use effectively control the weed  population (Rubin, 1991)</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><em>Senecio vulgaris</em> resistance to triazine group of  herbicide was noticed during 1970</li>
                  <li>Worldwide  183 weeds have developed resistance to herbicides till 1997</li>
                  <li>In  India the most common example is <em>Philaris  minor</em></li>
                  <li>The  highest resistance in 61 weed species was recorded for atrazine</li>
                  <li>USA  alone found to have 49 herbicide resistant weeds, the highest in the world</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Tolerance</strong>: The term tolerance refers to the  partial resistance and presently the usage of the term is discouraged due to  inconsistency in quantifying the degree of tolerance.<br />
                  <strong>Gross Resistance</strong>: When a weed biotype exhibits  resistant to two or more herbicides due to the presence of a single herbicide  mechanism.<br />
                  <strong>Multiple resistance</strong>: It is a situation where resistant  plants posses two or more distinct resistant mechanism to a single herbicide or  groups of herbicides.<br />
                  <strong>Basic principles of herbicide  resistance</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Time,  dose and method of application of herbicide variation</li>
                    <li>Variation  in phenotypes of a population</li>
                    <li>Genetic  variation by mutation or activation of pre existing genes</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Conditions favourable for development  of Herbicide resistance</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <ul>
                    <ul>
                      <ul>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Repeated  use of same herbicide or use of herbicide with same mode of action due to the  practices of monoculture</li>
                          <li>Areas  where minimum/zero tillage is followed</li>
                          <li>Fields  where farmers rely on only herbicides for high degree/level of weed control  including nurseries, orchards</li>
                          <li>Non-crop  situations like road sides, railway tracks etc. where herbicides are repeated  used may be at higher doses than cropped situation</li>
                        </ul>
                      </ul>
                    </ul>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
                <h5>Resistance was exhibited in crop  is due to</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Herbicide  metabolism by crops making them inactive</li>
                  <li>Absence  of certain metabolic process in crops compared to weeds and thus tolerating the  herbicides</li>
                  <li>Crops  couples the herbicide molecule </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>ANTIDOTES</strong><br />
                  Chemicals which are used to  inactivate the applied herbicides are called as antidotes. Eg. Paraquat spray  can be inactivated by spraying 1% ferric chloride<br />
  <strong>SAFENERS / PROTECTANTS</strong><br />
                  Substances used for protecting crop  plants, which are otherwise susceptible or less tolerant to some herbicides at  doses required for good weed control.<br />
                  eg.,  Naphthalic anhydride (NA) – 0.5g / kg of seed for rice to protect against  molinate and alachlor<br />
                  R –  27788 – soil application protects maize from alachlor and metolachlor</p>
                <p><strong>Mode of Action</strong>:   Safeners enter the target plants and compete there with herbicide  molecules for a binding site on some native enzyme.<br />
                  <strong>ADJUVANTS</strong><br />
                  Adjuvants are chemicals employed to  improve the herbicidal effects, sometimes making a difference between  satisfactory and unsatisfactory weed control.</p>
                <h5>Mode of Action:  Adjuvants aid the herbicide availability at  the action site in plants. Some important kinds of adjuvants are</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Surfactant  ( Surface active agents)</strong></li>
                  <li>Aid  in wetting the waxy leaf surface with aqueous herbicide sprays (wetting agents)</li>
                  <li>In  spreading the hydrophilic herbicides uniformly over the foliage (spreaders)</li>
                  <li>In  the penetration of herbicide into the target leaves and stems (penetrates)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>            A water drop is held as a ball on a  waxy leaf surface. (Take water in a beaker, if you dip a leaf of <em>Cynodon dactylon</em> and pull it back, you  can see the leaf without wetting.  But if  you add a drop of surfactant you can readily wet the foliage.). With the  addition of surfactant, the water drop flattens down to wet the leaf surface  and let the herbicide act properly.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Stabilizing  agents</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>These  include <br />
                  <strong> (i) Emulsifiers:</strong> A substance which stabilizes (reduces  the tendency to separate) a suspension of droplets of one liquid which  otherwise would not mix with the first one.   It substitutes for constant agitation of spray liquids during field operation.<br />
                  Eg., ABS, Solvaid, 15-5-3,  15-5-9.<br />
  <strong>(ii) Dispersing agents:</strong> They stabilize suspensions. They keep  fine parricides of wettable powder in suspension in water even after initial  vigorous agitation has been withdrawn.   They act by increasing the hydration of fine particles of WP laden with  the herbicides.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Coupling  agents (Solvents and co-solvents)</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>            Chemical that is used to solubalize  a herbicide in a concentrated form; the resulting solution is soluble with  water in all proportions. Eg., 2,4-D is insoluble in water, but it can be  dissolved in polyethylene glycol to make it water soluble.<br />
                  <strong>Common solvents:</strong> Benzene, acetone, petroleum ether,  carbon tetrachloride </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Humicants  (Hygroscopic agents)</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>            Humicants prevent rapid drying of  herbicide sprays on the foliage, thus providing an extended opportunity of  herbicide absorption Eg. glycerol.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Deposit  builders (Stickers or filming agents)</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>            Chemicals added to herbicide  concentrates to hold the toxicant in intimate contact with the plant  surface.  They also reduce washing off of  the toxicant from the treated foliage by rain. Eg., Several petroleum oils, Du  pont spreader sticker, Citowett.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Compatibility  agents</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>            Used to intimately mix fertilizers  and pesticides in spray liquids Eg. Compex</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Activators  (Synergists)</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>            These are the chemicals having  cooperative action with herbicides. The resultant phytotoxicity is more than  the effect of the two working independently.<br />
                  Eg.,  Paraffinic oils, Ammonium thiocyanate, Urea and Ammonium chloride to enhance  2,4 –D phytotoxicity<br />
  <strong>8. Drift control agents</strong><br />
                  Herbicide spray drifts may pose  serious hazards to non-target plants. Eg., 2,4-D on cotton. Solution is to  spray herbicide liquids in large droplets.<br />
                  Thickening  agents eg., (Decagin, Sodium alginate)<br />
  <strong>MANAGEMIENT OF HERBICIDE RESIDUES IN  SOIL</strong><br />
                  An ideal soil applied herbicide  should persist long-enough to give an acceptable period of weed control but not  so long that soil residues after crop harvest limit the nature of subsequent  crops which can be grown.  Various  management techniques have been developed which can help to minimise the  residue hazards in soil.<br />
                  A.  Use of Optimum dose of herbicide<br />
                  Hazards from residues of herbicides  can be minimised by the application of chemicals at the lowest dosage by which  the desired weed control is achieved. Besides, applying herbicides in bands  rather as broadcast will reduce the total amount of herbicide to be applied.  This will be practicable in line sown crops or crops raised along ridges, such  as cotton, sugarcane, sorghum, maize etc. <br />
  <strong>B. Application of farm yard manure </strong><br />
                  Farmyard  manure application is an effective method to mitigate the residual toxicity of  herbicides.  The herbicide molecules get  adsorbed in their colloidal fraction and make them unavailable for crops and  weeds.  Besides, FYM enhances the  microbial activity, which in turn degrades the herbicide at a faster rate.<br />
  <strong>C. Ploughing/cultivating the Land</strong><br />
                  Ploughing with disc plough or  intercultivators reduces the herbicide toxicity, as the applied herbicide is  mixed to a large volume of soil and gets diluted. In case of deep ploughing the  herbicide layer is inverted and buried in deeper layers and thereby the  residual toxicity got reduced <br />
  <strong>D. Crop rotation</strong><br />
                  Ragi – Cotton – Sorghum is the  common crop rotation under irrigated field conditions of Coimbatore district.  Fluchloralin 0.9 kg or butachlor 0.75 kg/ha + Hand weeding at 35 DAT for ragi +  sunflower (border crop), pendimethalin 1.0 kg/ha + hand weeding on 35 DAS for  cotton intercropped with onion and two manual weeding at 15 and 35 DAS for sorghum  inter cropped with cowpea is the recommended weed control practice.  The above weed management schedule did not  show any residual effect in the cropping system because the herbicides are  changed for every crop.<br />
  <strong>E. Use of non phyto-toxic oil</strong><br />
                  Atrazine residual hazard could be  reduced by mixing non phyto-toxic oil which would also enhance the weed killing  potency </p>
                <p><strong>F. Use of activated carbon</strong></p>
                <p>            Activated  carbon has a high adsorptive capacity because of its tremendous surface area  which vary from 600 - 1200 m2/g. Incorporation of 50 kg/ha of  activated charcoal inactivated completely chlorsulfuron applied at 1.25 and  2.50 kg/ha and did not affect the yield of maize compared to untreated control.  Application of charcoal at 5.0 kg/ha along the seed line reduced the residual  toxicity of atrazine in soybean crop.<br />
                  <strong>G. Use of safeners and antidotes</strong><br />
                  A new development in herbicide usage  is the use of safeners and antidotes in order to protect the crop plant from  possible damage by a herbicide.  This  means that it may be possible to use certain herbicides on crops that would  normally be affected by herbicide. NA (1,8-naphthalic anhydride) has been used  as a seed dressing on rice to protect the crop against molinate and  alachlor.  Another herbicide safener  cyometrinil is used along with metolachlor in grain sorghum and other crop  species.<br />
  <strong>H. Leaching the soil</strong><br />
                Leaching the herbicide by frequent  irrigation is possible especially in case of water soluble herbicides.  In this case, the herbicides are leached down  to lower layers i.e. beyond the reach of the crop roots.</p>
