				<p>Shifts in weeds are not new. Weed  shifts have happened as long as humans have cultivated crops. Weedy and  invasive species can easily adapt to changes in production practices in order  to take advantage of the available niches. Weeds are well equipped to flourish  in disturbed agricultural systems. Weeds are genetically diverse and can  readily take advantage of the variety of conditions created by any crop  production system. Therefore, one key to reducing the predominance of any given  weed species isto increase the diversity of crops within the cropping system,  or at least the diversity of weed management practices within the cropping  system.<br />
            A change from conventional tillage  to a conservation tillage system can lead to shifts in weed species  composition. Weed shifts can also occur both within a population of a certain  species (e.g., surviving mutants), or within a plant community (e.g., certain  species). A weed species shift can result in the emergence of weeds  tolerant of existing weed management practices. A need to recognise  and understand shifts in weed populations in various cropping systems is  important. An understanding of crop production effects on weed  species shifts can lead to development of improved weed management  strategies.<br />
<strong>WEED SHIFT</strong><br />
            A weed  shift is the change in the composition or relative frequencies of weeds in a  weed population (all individuals of a single species in a defined area) or  community (all plant populations in a defined area) in response to natural or  human-made environmental changes in an agricultural system. <br />
            Weed  shifts occur when weed management practices do not control an entire weed  community or population. The management practice could be herbicide use or any  other practice such as tillage, manure application, or harvest schedule that  brings about a change in weed species composition. <br />
            Some species or biotypes are killed  by (or susceptible to) the weed management practice, others are not affected by  the management practice (tolerant or resistant), and still others do not  encounter the management practice (dormant at application). Those species that  are not controlled can grow, reproduce, and increase in the community;  resulting in a weed shift. Any cultural, physiological, biological, or chemical  practice that modifies the growing environment without controlling all species  equally can result in a weed shift.<br />
            In the  case of chemical weed control, no single herbicide controls all weeds, as weeds  differ in their susceptibility to an herbicide. Susceptible weeds are largely  eliminated over time with continued use of the same herbicide. This allows  inherently tolerant weed species to remain, which often thrive and proliferate  with the reduced competition. As a result, there is a gradual shift to tolerant  weed species when practices are continuously used that are not effective  against those species. A weed shift does not necessarily have to be a shift to  a different species. For example, with a foliar herbicide without residual  activity like glyphosate, there could also be a shift within a weed species to  a late emerging biotype that emerges after application.<br />
<strong>WEED RESISTANCE</strong><br />
            In  contrast to weed shift, weed resistance is a change in the population of weeds  that were previously susceptible to an herbicide, turning them into a  population of the same species that is no longer controlled by that herbicide.  While weed shifts occur with any agronomic practice (crop rotation, tillage,  frequent harvest or use of particular herbicide), the evolution of weed  resistance is only the result of continued herbicide appplication. The use of a  single class herbicide application continuously over time creates selection  pressure so that resistant individuals of a species survive and reproduce,  while susceptible ones are killed. <br />
             A weed shift is far more common than weed  resistance, and ordinarily take less time to develop. If an herbicide does not  control all the weeds, the tendency is to quickly jump to the conclusion that  resistance has occurred. <br />
            A common  misconception is that weed resistance is instrinsically linked to genetically  engineered crops. However, this is not correct. The occurrence of weed shifts  and weed resistance is not unique to genetically engineered crops. Weed shifts  and resistance are caused by the practices (for example repeated use of single  herbicide) that may accompany a genetically engineered crop and not the GE crop  itself. Similarly, tere is another belive that resistance is transferred from  Ge crop to weed species. However, unless the crop is genetically very closely  related to naturally occuring weed, weed resiatnce cannot be transferred from  crop to weed. <br />
            Transgenic  herbicide resistance crops have greater potential to foester weed shifts and  resistant weeds since a grower is more likely to use single herbicide in  transgenic herbicide resistance crops. The increase in acrege of these crops  could increase the potential for weed shifts and weed resistance in the  cropping systems utilising transgenic herbicide resistance crops. <br />
<strong>WEED  MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES TO REDUCE WEED SHIFTS AND RESISTANCE</strong><br />
<strong>WEED  IDENTIFICATION</strong><br />
            Effective  weed management practices begin with proper identification to assess the  competiveness of the weeds present and to select the proper herbicide if one is  needed. A weed management strategy to prevent weed shifts and weed resistancce  requires knowledge of the composition of weeds present. Identification of young  seedlings is particularly important because seedling weeds are easier to  control. <br />
<strong>FREQUENT  MONITORING FOR ESCAPES</strong><br />
            It is  difficult to detect an emerging weed shift or weed resistance problem if fields  are not frequently monitored for weeds that escapes current weed management  practices. Identification and frequent monitoring can detect problem weeds  early and guide management practices, including herbicide selection, ratre and  timing.<br />
<strong>HERBICIDE  RATE AND TIMING</strong><br />
            In weed  management programme the grower must be sure to use the proper herbicide rate  for the particular weeds species as they may sometimes tolerant to lower doses.  And also the time of application of the herbicide dose is important i.e it  treat the weeds when they are small, because after crossing certain stgage they  may be tolerant to that particular herbicide or dosage.<br />
<strong>CROP ROTATION</strong><br />
            One of the most effective practices  for preventing weed shifts and weed resistance is crop rotation, which allows  growers to modify selection pressure imposed on weeds. Crops differ in their  ability to compete with weeds; some weeds are a problem in some crops, while they  are less problematic in others.  Rotation  therefore would not favor any particular weed spectrum. Crop rotation also  allows the use of different weed control practices, such as cultivation and  application of herbicides with different sites of action.  As a result, no single weed spices or biotype  should become dominant.  <br />
<strong>AGRONOMIC PRACTICES</strong><br />
            In addition to crop rotation,  several management practices may have an impact on the selection of problem  weed populations.  If problem weeds  germinate at a specific time of year, crop seeding date can be shifted to avoid  these weed populations.  Delaying  irrigation after can reduce germination of certain summer annual weeds.  However, this practice only works on some  soil types and water stress resistant cropsonly. Harvest management can, assist  in eliminating or suppressing problem weed populations in some cases, but  harvest must occur before weed seed production to prevent weed proliferation.<br />
<strong>ROTATION OF HERBICIDES</strong><br />
            Weed shifts occur because herbicides  are not equally effective against all weed species and herbicides differ  greatly in the weed spectrum they control. A weed species that is not  controlled will survive and increase in density following repeated use of one  herbicide.  Therefore, rotating  herbicides is recommended.  Rotation of  herbicides reduces weed shifts, provided the rotation herbicide reduces weed  shifts, provided the rotational herbicide is highly effective against the weed  species that is not controlled with the primary herbicide.  The grower should rotate to an herbicide with  a complimentary spectrum of weed control, along with a different mechanism of  action and therefore a different herbicide binding site. Weed susceptibility  charts are useful to help develop an effective herbicide binding site and  herbicide rotation scheme. In addition, publications on herbicide chemical  families are available to assist growers in choosing herbicides with different  mechanisms of action. <br />
            Rotating herbicides is also an  effective strategy for resistance management. Within a weed species there are  different biotypes, each with its own genetic makeup, enabling some of them to  survive a particular herbicide application.   The susceptible weeds in a population are killed, while the resistant  ones survives, set seed, and increase over time.  Using an effective herbicide with a different  mode of action from the one to which the weeds are resistant, however, controls  both the susceptible and resistant biotypes. This prevents reproduction and  slows the spread of the resistant biotype.<br />
<strong>            </strong>Frequency of Rotation depends on weed  species and escapes. There is no definitive rule on how often herbicides should  be rotated.  It is better to rotate at  least once on the middle years or more often for perrenial crop. It can also be  modified depending upon actual observations of evolving weed problems.  The key point, which cannot be  overemphasized, is the importance of thorough monitoring for weed escapes.  Producers should stay alert to the appearance  of weed species shifts and evolution of resistant weeds. Weed resistance should  be confirmed by controlled studies conducted by a weed scientist.  However in these situations, it is imperative  to prevent reproduction of a potentially resistant biotype.  Treat weed escapes with alternative herbicides  or other effective control measure.</p>

                  <strong>AQUATIC WEEDS</strong><br />
                  Almost all the water bodies have  plants growing in them. Presence of plants in water bodies is essential for the  conversion of solar energy into chemical energy for the development of aquatic  fauna like fish, prawns etc. and for the continuous addition of oxygen to water  during photosynthesis. If the water plants due to overgrowth make such water  bodies unfit and take the shape of noxious aquatic vegetation, these may be  referred as aquatic weeds. Aquatic weeds are the greatest problem in fishing,  irrigation and efficient water supply. Because of scarce water supply and high  population it has almost become imperative in every country to save water from  the ravages of aquatic weeds. Since the beginning of this century, greater  efforts are being made using the variety of implements, chemicals and  bio-agents. Of the 800,000 ha of fresh water available in India for  pisciculture, about 40% rendered unsuitable for fish production because of  invasion by aquatic weeds.&nbsp; Some major aquatic weeds are;<br />
  <strong>WATER  HYACINTH</strong><br />
  <strong>Origin  and Distribution</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Water Hyacinth (<em>Eichhornia crassipes)</em> which is  native to the Amazon basin, Brazil, became widespread throughout the world, also  due to its attractive appearance. It is commercially available as an ornamental  for ponds. At present it occurs as a weed throughout tropical and subtropical  regions of the world, including North and South America, Africa, Asia,  Australia and New Zealand. It is considered the worst aquatic weed in the  world.<br />

                <p><strong>Morphology  and Biology</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>This perennial  herbaceous plant is a floating freshwater hydrophyte. It belongs to the Family <em>Pontederiaceae. </em>The flowers are bluish purple, large and self-fertile. The seeds are  produced in large numbers and are contained in capsules, each capsule  containing up to 300 seeds. The seeds can remain viable for 5-20 years. The  plant can also </p>
                <h2>WATER LETTUCE</h2>
                <p><strong>Origin  and Distribution</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>The area of origin of<strong> </strong>Water Lettuce (<em>Pistia stratiotes</em> L.), is most probably South  America. The plant spread widely and at present occurs in all continents,  except Europe and Antarctica. Probably the initial spread took place through  ballast water in ships from South America. <br />
                  <center><img src="lec17_clip_image004.jpg" alt="" width="410" height="297" hspace="12" align="center" /></center></p>
                
                <p><strong>Morphology  and Biology</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>This perennial  freshwater hydrophyte is a herbaceous floating plant belonging to the Family <em>Araceae</em>.  It consists of a rosette of pale green leaves, prominently veined and it  resembles a small lettuce plant. Water Lettuce has velvety-hairy, erect leaf  blades, a very short stem and long feathery roots suspended in water. The  flowers are bisexual. The plant reproduces and spreads rapidly by means of  stolons and seeds. The seeds are easily carried by water for long distances,  since they float during the first two days after they reach maturity. Both  Water Lettuce and Water Hyacinth can bioaccumulate heavy metals. <br />
                  <strong>WATER FERN</strong><br />
                  <strong>Origin  and Distribution</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Water Fern (<em>Salvinia  molesta</em>) is native of South America. The plant was introduced to Sri Lanka  in the 1930s and has rapidly spread since then, now occurring in tropical and  subtropical regions worldwide. The species is commercially available for  aquariums and ponds and thus it was initially introduced and may still  contribute to its spread.</p>
               
                <p align="center"><img src="lec17_clip_image006.jpg" alt="" width="432" height="286" hspace="12" align="center" /></p>
                
                <p><strong>Morphology  and Biology</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Water Fern is a  free-floating fern belonging to the Family <em>Salviniaceae</em> that lives in  freshwater systems. Stagnant or slowly moving waters are the habitats most  favourable to its growth. It consists of a horizontal rhizome that floats just  below the water surface and produces at each node three leaves. The plant does  not have roots. The submerged leaf serves as roots by absorbing water and  nutrients. Hairs on the aerial leaves allow the plant to float. Individual plants  are up to 30 cm long. Their growth is extremely fast, allowing the population  to double within about one week. Water Fern readily reproduces vegetatively, by  fragmentation of the rhizome, small fragments allowing the development of new  infestations. <br />
                  <strong>Problems</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>All these weeds  develop dense mats on the surface of the water and becoming a major weed  problem. The main problems arising from the growth of these weeds are</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>an  enormous water loss through evapotranspiration, that alters the water balance  of entire regions</li>
                  <li>clogging  rivers and canals and related problems</li>
                  <li>the  impediment to water flow, that increases sedimentation, causing flooding and  soil erosion</li>
                  <li>hampering  fishing and dramatically reducing the catch and the source of food and income  for local populations</li>
                  <li>a  drastic change in the physical and chemical properties of water and in the  environment in the water bodies invaded, with detrimental effects on plants and  animals;</li>
                  <li>interfering  with the activity of hydroelectric power stations </li>
                  <li>a  serious threaten to agricultural production, following the blockage of  irrigation canals and drainage systems.</li>
                  <li>hampering  fishing</li>
                  <li>hampering  navigation</li>
                  <li>indirectly  affects human health, since it provides a suitable breeding habitat for pests  and vectors of diseases.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Management </strong><br />
                  An integrated and to the extent  possible an environment-friendly approach is to be employed for management of  aquatic weeds. Aquatic weed-control measures can broadly be grouped into the  following categories.<br />
  <strong>Preventive</strong><br />
                  The success of preventive weed-management  programmes varies with the weed species, its means of dissemination and the  amount of efforts applied. Preventive weed-management programmes usually  require community action through the enactment and enforcement of appropriate  laws and regulations. <br />
  <strong>Mechanical<br />
  </strong>            This has both, advantages and  limitations. Advantages include utilization of available man-power; is  environment friendly, yields immediate results, is non-selective with fewer  chances of permitting ecological shifts in aquatic flora; lessens mass nutrient  load of eutrophic water bodies, helping indirectly in diminishing the future  weed populations; reduces dependence on import of herbicides; harvested weeds  may have various utilities as feed, manure, energy source etc; and most  importantly can be exercised in any localized areas of water bodies. The  limitations include limited effectiveness as in some cases the weeds re-grow  from their rootstocks, rhizomes and the like spreading weeds new areas;  labour-intensive and expensive and sometime removal of weeds may deplete water  bodies of their nutrients limiting growth of planktons. The methods include,  netting, erecting barriers, chaining, dredging, draining, use of water-weed  cutters, submergence, shading, cleaning of irrigation waters etc. <br />
  <strong>Biological</strong><br />
                  Biological methods of  management require the use of organisms that have been used for biological  control, are diverse and include various types of animals and plants like  insects, fishes, pathogens, nematodes etc. Biological management is more complex  than chemical weed control because it requires (a) long-term planning, (b)  multiple tactics, and (c) manipulation of cropping system and direct  interaction with the environment.<br />
                  Use of several species of  herbivorous fishes which feed on submerged aquatic weeds include <em>Tilapa sp</em>., <em>Ctenopharyngodon idella</em>, and other species. Observations are also  available for rodents, snails etc. The use of insects like <em>Neochetina bruchi</em> and <em>N.  eichhorniae</em> for control of water-hyacinth, and <em>Cyrtobagous salviniae</em> for control of <em>Salvinia molesta</em> has been found effective in India. <br />
  <strong>Problamatic weeds</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Weed control practices  often have an effect on the weeds, on a year by year basis. Before the  development of herbicides, growers relied heavily on tillage as a tool for  controlling and suppressing weeds. Once herbicides became a valuable tool, some  of the problem weeds found in predominantly tillage based management practices  began to fade and new problematic weeds began to fill the gap. As our habits  change, specific weeds will exploit the new niches we create and become the  more dominant species.<br />
                  Some of the weeds  like <em>Cyperus rotundus</em>, <em>Cynodon dactylon</em>, <em>Eleusine indica</em> etc., are listed as world’s worst weeds. <em>Cyperus rotundus </em>is the most problamatic  weed present in 92 countries, followed by<em> Cynodon dactylon </em>in 80 countries. Both weeds are perennial, mainly  propagated by vegetative means and also by seeds. <em>Cyperus rotundus </em>is a problem weed in 52 crops while <em>Eleusine indica </em>in 46 crops. Some of the  world’s worst weeds are listed below,</p>

                <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
                <h3>PERENNIAL WEED MANAGEMENT</h3>
                <h3>Prevention</h3>
                <p>            The most basic and effective of all  methods to control perennial weeds is prevention. As discussed earlier, there  are several means of weed seed dispersal, most of which can be prevented.  Ensuring clean crop seed, animal feed, and hay is the most important measure in  preventing seed dispersal. Other methods of prevention include cleaning field  machinery and harvest equipment when moving between fields, proper long-term  manure storage to reduce seed viability after passing through animals'  digestive tracts, and maintenance of weed-free irrigation water.<br />
                  Crop rotation can be another  effective method to prevent the establishment of perennial weeds. The most  effective crop rotations for this purpose include not only crops that compete  well with perennial weeds, but also those that allow the use of herbicides to  control perennial seedlings.</p>
                <h3>MECHANICAL WEED CONTROL</h3>
                <p>            Cultivation, when combined with  other management tactics, can be used to control seedlings before  energy-storing vegetative tissue has accumulated. Mechanical control no longer  is effective after energy has been stored in underground vegetative tissue. In  fact, cultivation of established perennials can spread weeds by cutting roots  and moving them to new areas.<br />
                  Perennial weeds are more common in  reduced-tillage fields, where there is little soil disturbance to disrupt the  development of below-ground storage organs. Once perennial weeds are established  in reduced-tillage fields, cultivation is ineffective and might increase the  spread of vegetative roots.<br />
                  In pasture and forage crops,  frequent mowing or cutting can prevent weed seed production and reduce the  amount of energy stored in below-ground structures. Most important, maintenance  of a vigorous crop stand through proper fertility and water management, seeding  density, and variety selection will allow the competitive ability of the crop  to suppress perennial weed growth. This simple &quot;hands-off&quot; approach  requires little additional input or management, but can greatly reduce weed  seed production and root growth.</p>
                <h3>CHEMICAL WEED CONTROL</h3>
                <p>            Perennial weed control with  herbicides must be repeated for 2 to 3 years and combined with other management  tactics such as mowing. The key is to get the herbicide into the roots.  Herbicide activity relies on foliar absorption and transport from the leaves to  the root system. Young leaves move nutrients from the root in an upward,  above-ground direction, while more mature leaves transport photosynthetic  products to the root system for storage. Thus, the most effective herbicide  activity occurs as the product is transported to the roots with the products of  photosynthesis.<br />
                  Herbicides  are most effective on perennial weeds in the early fall, when weeds are  transporting energy to the roots before winter dormancy. Treatment just before  and during flower bud initiation also is effective, as the herbicide will be  carried with photosynthetic products to the roots. To ensure the presence of  sufficient mature foliage, apply postemergent herbicides either 1 to 2 weeks  before cultivation or mowing, or after weed regrowth is at least 8 inches tall.</p>
                <h3>BIOLOGICAL WEED CONTROL</h3>
                <p>            Biological control is a slow  process, and results are not guaranteed. Therefore, it is used most  appropriately as a component of an integrated weed management system that  relies on multiple tactics for perennial weed control. For example, the fungus <em>Concholiobolus  lunatus </em>kills barnyardgrass seedlings with fewer than two leaves, but  growth of larger plants is only slowed and plants recover. However, when the  fungus is combined with a sublethal dose of atrazine (a dose that injures but  does not kill the barnyardgrass), larger barnyardgrass plants can be controlled  better than when atrazine is used alone.</p>
                <h3 align="left">INTEGRATED WEED  MANAGEMENT</h3>
                <p>            Management of perennial weeds is  most successful when multiple tactics are employed, such as the combination of  chemical, mechanical, and cultural control. Integrated weed management, when combined  with prevention and control of weeds outside of crop production areas, provides  the best long-term management of perennial weeds.</p>
