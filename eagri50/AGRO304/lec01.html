				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weeds  are plants that are unwanted in a given situation and may be harmful, dangerous  or economically detrimental. Weeds are a serious threat to primary production  and biodiversity. They reduce farm and forest productivity, displace native  species and contribute significantly to land and water degradation. The costs  of weeds to the natural environment are also high, with weed invasion being  ranked second only to habitat loss in causing biodiversity decline.<br />
Despite  considerable government and private sector investment, weed invasion still  represents a major threat to both the productive capacity of land and water and  the integrity of our natural ecosystems. An efficient weed control program can  only be developed after the weed has been properly identified. Weeds can be  managed using many different methods. The most effective management of weeds is  usually achieved through collaboration and co-operation, in partnerships  between the community, land owners, agriculture, industry and the various  levels of government, using a combination of methods in conjunction with a  thorough follow-up campaign.<br />
Weed  management is an important component of plant protection improving the  production potential of crops. It includes management of the weeds in a way  that the crop sustains its production potential without being harmed by the  weeds. Weed management is done through the mechanical, cultural and chemical  means. Use of biological control methods in field crops is being considered, but  still not much in use. Use of herbicides is an important method in the modern  concept of much in use. Use of herbicides is an important method in the modern  concept of weed-management technology. New hand-tools and implements have also  been designed to assist in wed-management programme.<br />
<strong>Characteristics  of weeds</strong><br />
 Weeds are also like other plants but have  special characteristics that tend to put them in the category of unwanted  plants. </p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Most of the weeds especially       annuals produce enormous quantity of seeds, e.g. wild oats (<em>Avena fatua</em>),       produces 250 seeds per plant, whereas wild amaranth (<em>Amaranthus viridis</em>)       produces nearly 11 million seeds. It has been observed that among 61       perennial weeds, the average seed-production capacity was 26,500 per       plant. </li>
                  <li>Weeds have the capacity to       withstand adverse conditions in the field, because they can modify their       seed production and growth according to the availability of moisture and       temperature. They can germinate under adverse soil-moisture conditions,       have short period of plant growth, generally grow faster rate and produce       seed earlier than most of the crops growing in association. </li>
                  <li>Weed seeds remain viable for       longer period without losing their viability, e.g. annual meadow grass (<em>Poa       annua</em>) and scarlet pimpernel (<em>Anagallis arvensis</em>) remain viable       foe about 8 years; creeping thistle (<em>Cirsium arvense</em>) for 20 years       and field bind weed (<em>Convolvulus arvensis</em>) for about 50 years. </li>
                  <li>Weed seeds have a tremendous       capacity to disperse from one place to another through wind, water and       animals including man. Many of times, weed seeds mimic with the crop seeds       due to their size and get transported from one place to another along with       them. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Harmful effects</strong></p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Weeds have serious impacts on agricultural       production. It is estimated that in general weeds cause 5% loss in       agricultural production in most of developed countries, 10% loss in less       developed countries and 25% loss in least developed countries.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>            In  India, yield losses due to weeds are more than those from pest and diseases.  Yield losses due to weeds vary with the crops. Every crop is exposed to severe  competition from weeds. Most of these weeds are self-sown and they provide  competition caused by their faster rate of growth in the initial stages of crop  growth. In some crops, the yields are reduced by more than 50% due to weed  infestation. These loses caused by weeds in some of the important crops are  given in the following table. </p>

                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Weeds reduce the quality of marketable agricultural       produce. Cotamination of weed seeds of <em>Datura,  Argemone,  Brassica</em> etc., is harmful to human       health and weed seeds present in the produce cause odd odour sometimes.</li>
                  <li> Weeds not       only reduce yield but also interfere with agricultural operations. Weeds       make mechanical sowing a difficult process and render harvesting       difficult, leading to increased expenditure on labour, equipment and       chemicals for their removal. </li>
                  <li>In aquatic environment, weeds block the flow of       water in canals, water-transport system and drainage system, rendering       navigation difficult. The dense growth of aquatic weeds pollutes water by       deoxygenating it and killing the fishes. </li>
                  <li>Weeds are also a nuisance and a fire hazard along       railway lines, roads, right-of- ways, airports, forest and industrial       sites. </li>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Beneficial Effects</strong> <br />
                  In spite of all the difficulties  caused by weeds, they can offer some beneficial properties, particularly when  occurring at low densities. These aspects should be utilised in the farming  system, although this may make organic management more complicated than  chemical based systems. Some of the potential benefits of weeds are listed  below:</p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Helping to conserve soil moisture       and prevent erosion. A ground cover of weeds will reduce the amount of       bare soil exposed helping to conserve nutrients, particularly nitrogen       which could otherwise be leached away, especially on light soils. </li>
                  <li>Food and shelter can be provided       for natural enemies of pests and even alternative food sources for crop       pests. The actual presence of weed cover may be a factor in increasing       effectiveness of biological control of pests and reducing pest damage. </li>
                  <li>Weeds can also be valuable       indicators of growing conditions in a field, for example of water levels,       compaction and pH.</li>
                  <li>Weeds can be an important source       of food for wildlife, especially birds. Bird populations have been       declining on farmland over the last few decades and leaving weeds as a       resource has been shown to help revive bird populations.</li>
