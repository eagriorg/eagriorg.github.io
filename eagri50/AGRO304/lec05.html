				<p>Weeds posseses many growth characteristics and adaptations  which enable them to exploit successfully the numerous ecological niches left  unocccupied by crop cultures. Weeds compete with themselves and with crop  plant. Among the more important adoptations relevent to competitive advantage  are properly synchronized germination, rapid establishment and growth of  seedlings, tolerance to shading effects by the crop or by other weeds at the  time of establishment, quick response to available soil moisture and nutrients,  adaptation to the most severe climatic situations of the habitat, adaptations  to the edaphic regime, relative immunity to post seeding soil disturbance,  practices and resistance to herbicides that are used. In the nitial stages of  invasion by weeds of exposed ecological niches, only a very limited competition  for resources by the crop and weed may occur, but as establishment of the  crop-weed association is completed, competition for the available reources is  more obvious.<br />
            Plant  competition is a natural force whereby crop and weed plants tend to attain a  maximum combined growth and yield, with the development of each species being  to some extent at the expense of the other. It occurs when the demands of the  plants for moisture, nutrients, light, and possibly carbon dioxide exceed the  available supply. Competition may develop between crop and weed plants and also  between individual plants of each. The ultimate outcome of competition usually results  in the development of a characteristic crop-weed association. Crop plants and  weeds may grow and mature in the state of mutual supression that is often found  in crops where no suitable herbicide is available to control the weeds. The  weed suppresses the crop and result in reduction of yield. The crop also  suppresses the weeds, a condition often found in row crop cultures. This is a  logical sequence in a crop habitat where both cultural and herbicide methods  provide effective control.<br />
            A  principle of plant competition is that the first plants to occupy an area have  an advantage over latecomers. This principle is of foremost consideration in  practical weed control, where cropping practices are always directed to the  establishment of the crop ahead of the weeds. <br />
            Competition  and allelopathy are the main interactions, which are of importance between crop  and weed. Allelopathy is distinguished from competition because it depends on a  chemical compound being added to the environment while competition involves  removal or reduction of an essential factor or factors from the environment,  which would have been otherwise utilized. </p>
                <p><strong>CROP  WEED COMPETITION </strong><br />
                  Weeds  appear much more adapted to agro-ecosystems than our crop plants. Without  interference by man, weeds would easily wipe out the crop plants. This is  because of their competition for nutrients, moisture, light and space which are  the principle factors of production of crop. Generally, an increase in on  kilogram of weed growth will decrease one kilogram of crop growth.<br />
                  <strong>1.  Competition for Nutrients</strong><br />
                Weeds  usually absorb mineral nutrients faster than many crop plants and accumulate  them in their tissues in relatively larger amounts.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><em>Amaranthus</em> sp. accumulate over 3% N on dry  weight basis and are termed as &ldquo;nitrophills&rdquo;.</li>
                  <li><em>Achyranths aspera</em>, a &lsquo;P&rsquo; accumulator with over  1.5% P2O5 </li>
                  <li><em>Chenopodium</em> sp &amp; <em>Portulaca</em> sp. are &lsquo;K&rsquo; lovers with over 1.3% K2O in dry  matter</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li>The  associated weed is responsive to nitrogen and it utilizes more of the applied  &lsquo;N&rsquo; than the crop. Eg. The &lsquo;N&rsquo; uptake by <em>Echinochloa  crusgalli</em> is more than rice.</li>
                  <li>Nutrient  removal by weeds leads to huge loss of nutrients in each crop season, which is  often twice that of crop plants. For instance at early stages of maize  cultivation, the weeds found to remove 9 times more of N, 10 times more of P  and 7 times more of K.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>2.  Competition for moisture </strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>In  general, for producing equal amounts of dry matter, weeds transpire more water  than do most of our crop plants. It becomes increasingly critical with  increasing soil moisture stress, as found in arid and semi-arid areas. </li>
                  <li>As  a rule, C4 plants utilize water more efficiently resulting in more  biomass per unit of water.  <em>Cynodon dactylon</em> had almost twice as  high transpiration rate as pearl millet.</li>
                  <li>In  weedy fields soil moisture may be exhausted by the time the crop reaches the  fruiting stage, i.e. the peak consumptive use period of the crop, causing  significant loss in crop yields.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>3.  Competition for light </strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <ul>
                    <li>It  may commence very early in the cop season if a dense weed growth smothers the  crop seedlings.</li>
                    <li>It  becomes important element of crop-weed competition when moisture and nutrients  are plentiful.</li>
                    <li>In  dry land agriculture in years of normal rainfall the crop-weed competition is  limited to nitrogen and light.</li>
                    <li>Unlike  competition for nutrients and moisture once weeds shade a crop plant, increased  light intensity cannot benefit it.</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>4.  Competition for space (CO2)</strong><br />
                  Crop-weed  competition for space is the requirement for CO2 and the competition  may occur under extremely crowded plant community condition.  A more efficient utilization of CO2  by C4 type weeds may contribute to their rapid growth over C3  type of crops.<br />
                  <strong>ALLELOPATHY</strong><br />
                  Allelopathy  is the detrimental effects of chemicals or exudates produced by one (living)  plant species on the germination, growth or development of another plant  species (or even microorganisms) sharing the same habitat.<br />
                  Allelopathy  does not form any aspect of crop-weed competition, rather, it causes Crop-Weed  interference, it includes competition as well as possible allelopathy.<br />
                  Allelo  chemicals are produced by plants as end products, by-products and metabolites  liberalised from the plants; they belong to phenolic acids, flavanoides, and  other aromatic compounds viz., terpenoids, steroids, alkaloids and organic  cyanides.<br />

                <ul>
                  <li>Maize</li>
                  <li>Leaves  &amp; inflorescence of <em>Parthenium</em> sp.  affect the germination and seedling growth</li>
                  <li>Tubers  of <em>Cyperus esculentus</em> affect the dry  matter production</li>

                  <li>Sunflower</li>
                  <li>Seeds  of <em>Datura</em> affect germination &amp;  growth </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Allelopathic  Effect of crop plants on weeds</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Root  exudation of maize inhibits the growth of <em>Chenopodium  album</em></li>
                  <li>The  cold water extracts of wheat straw when applied to weeds reduce germination and  growth of <em>Abutilon </em>sp.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Allelopathic  effect of weeds on weeds</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Extract  of leaf leachate of decaying leaves of <em>Polygonum</em> contains flavonoides which are toxic to germination, root and hypocotyls growth  of weeds like <em>Amaranthus spinosus</em></li>
                  <li>Inhibitor  secreted by decaying rhizomes of <em>Sorghum  halepense</em> affect the growth of <em>Digitaria  sanguinalis</em> and <em>Amaranthus</em> sp.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Factors  influencing allelopathy<br />
                  a.  Plant factors</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Plant  density: Higher the crop density the lesser will be the allelo chemicals it  encounters</li>
                  <li>Life  cycle: If weed emerges later there will be less problem of allelochemicals</li>
                  <li>Plant  age: The release of allelochemicals occurs only at critical stage. For eg. in  case of <em>Parthenium</em>, allelopathy  occurs during its rosette &amp; flowering stage.</li>
                  <li>Plant  habit: The allelopathic interference is higher in perennial weeds.</li>
                  <li>Plant  habitat: Cultivated soil has higher values of allelopathy than uncultivated  soil.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>b. Climatic factors: The soil &amp; air temperature  as well as soil moisture influence the allelo chemicals potential <br />
                  c. Soil factors: Physico-chemical and biological  properties influence the presence of allelochemicals.<br />
                  d.    Stress factors:  Abiotic and Biotic stresses may also influence the activity of allelochemcals<br />
                  <strong>Mechanism  of action of allelochemicals</strong></p>
                <ul>

                <p><strong>Losses  Caused by Weeds</strong></p>
                <h4>A.  Reduction in crop yield</h4>
                <p>            Weeds compete with crop plants for  nutrients, soil moisture, space and sunlight. In general an increase in one  kilogram weed growth corresponds to reduction in one kilogram of crop  growth.  Depending on type of weed,  intensity of infestation, period of infestation, the ability of crop to compete  and climatic conditions the loss varies.   The table below depicts the percentage range of yield loss due to weeds  in some important field crops.</p>

                <p>            Among the pests weeds account for 45  % reduction in yield while the insects 30%, diseases 20% and other pests 5%.<br />
                  <strong>B. Loss in crop quality</strong><br />
                  If a crop contains weed seeds it is  to be rejected, especially when the crop is grown for seed. For example, the  wild oat weed seeds are similar in size and shape of the crops like barley,  wheat, and its admixture may lead to rejection for seed purpose.  Contamination by poisonous weed seeds is  unacceptable and increases costs of crop cleaning. The leafy vegetables much  suffers due to weed problem as the leafy weed mixture spoil the economic value.<br />
  <strong>C. Weeds as reservoirs of pests and  diseases</strong><br />
                  Weeds form a part of community of  organisms in a given area.  Consequently,  they are food sources for some animals, and are themselves susceptible to many  pests and diseases.  However, because of  their close association with crop they may serve as important reservoirs or  alternate host of pests and diseases.<br />
  <strong>D. Interference in crop handling </strong><br />
                  Some  weeds can make the operation of agricultural machinery more difficult, more  costly and even impossible.  Heavy  infestation of <em>Cynadon dactylon</em> causes poor ploughing performance.<br />
                  <strong>E. Reduction in land value</strong><br />
                  Heavy infestation by perennial weeds  could make the land unsuitable are less suitable for cultivation resulting in  loss in its monetary value.  Thousands of  hectare of cultivable area in rice growing regions of India have been  abandoned or not being regularly cultivated due to severe infestation of  nutgrass (<em>Cyperus rotundus</em>) and other  perennial grasses.<br />
  <strong>F. Limitation of crop choice</strong><br />
                  When certain weeds are heavily  infested, it will limit the growth of a particular crop.  The high infestation of parasitic weeds such  as <em>Striga lutea </em>may limit the growing  of sorghum or sugarcane.<br />
  <strong>G. Loss of human efficiency</strong><br />
                  Weeds reduce human efficiency  through physical discomfort caused by allergies and poisoning.  Weeds such as congress weed (<em>Parthenium hysterophorus</em>) causes itching.  Thorny weeds like <em>Solanum</em> spp.  restrict moment of farm workers in carrying out farm practices such as  fertilizer application, insect and disease control measures, irrigation,  harvesting etc.<br />
  <strong>H. Problems due to aquatic weeds</strong><br />
                  The aquatic weeds that grow along  the irrigation canals, channels and streams restricts the flow of water.  Weed obstruction cause reduction in velocity  of flow and increases stagnation of water and may lead to high siltation and  reduced carrying capacity. Aquatic weeds form breeding grounds for obnoxious  insects like mosquitoes.  They reduce  recreational value by interfering with fishing, swimming, boating, hunting and  navigation on streams and canals.</p>
                <p><strong>I. Other problems</strong><br />
                  Weeds  are troublesome not only in crop plants but also in play grounds and road sides  etc.  <em>Alternanthera  echinata </em>and <em>Tribulus terrestris</em> occurs in many of the playgrounds causing annoyance to players and spectators.<br />
                  Factors  affecting the competitive ability of crops against weeds<br />
                  a.  Density of weeds <br />
  <img src="lec05_clip_image001.gif" alt="" width="74" height="50" />            Increase  in density of weed decrease in yield is a normal phenomena. However, it is not  linear as few weeds do not affect the yields so much as other weed does and  hence, it is a sigmoidal relationship. </p>
                <p><strong>b.  Crop density </strong><br />
                  Increase  in plant population decreases weed growth and reduce competition until they are  self competitive. Crop density and rectangularity are very important in  determining the quantum and quality of crop environment available for the  growth of weeds. Wide row spacing with simultaneous high, intra-row crop plant  population may induce dense weed growth.   In this respect, square planting of crops in which there are equal row  and plant spacing should be ideal in reducing intra-crop plant competition.<br />
                  <strong>c.  Type of weeds species</strong><br />
                  The type of weeds that occur in a particular crop  influences the competition.  Occurrence  of a particular species of weed greatly influences the competition between the  crop &amp; weed.  For eg. <em>E. crusgalli</em> in rice, <em>Setaria viridis</em> in corn and <em>Xanthium</em> sp. in soybean  affects the crop yield. Flavaria australasica offers more competition than the  grasses<br />
                  <strong>d.  Type of crop species and their varieties </strong><br />
                  Crops  and their varieties differ in their competing ability with weeds e.g., the  decreasing order of weed competing ability is as: barley, rye, wheat and  oat.  High tolerance of barley to  competition from weeds is assigned to its ability to develop more roots that  are extensive during initial three weeks growth period than the others.<br />
                  Fast  canopy forming and tall crops suffer less from weed competition than the slow  growing and short stature &amp; crops. Dwarf and semi-dwarf varieties of crops  are usually more susceptible to competition from weeds than the tall varieties  became they grow slowly and initial stage.   In addition, their short stature covers the weeds less effectively. When  we compare the crop-weed competition between two varieties of groundnut TMV 2  (Bunch) and TMV 3 (Spreading), TMV 2 incurred a loss of over 30% pod yield  under uncontrolled weed - crop competition while TMV 3 lost only about 15% in  its yield. The main reason is due to the spreading nature of TMV 3, which  smothered weeds. Longer duration cultivars of rice have been found more  competitive to weeds than the short duration ones.<br />
                  <strong>e.  Soil factors</strong><br />
                  Soil type, soil fertility, soil moisture and soil  reaction influences the crop weed competition. Elevated soil fertility usually  stimulates weeds more than the crop, reducing thus crop yields.  Fertilizer application of weedy crop could  increase crop yields to a much lower level than the yield increase obtained  when a weed free crop is applied with fertilizer.<br />
                  Weeds  are adapted to grow well and compete with crops, in both moisture stress and  ample moisture conditions.  Removal of an  intense moisture stress may thus benefit crops more than the weeds leading to  increased yields.  If the weeds were  already present at the time of irrigation, they would grow so luxuriantly as to  completely over power the crops.  If the  crop in irrigated after it has grown 15 cm or more in a weed free environment  irrigation could hasten closing in of crop rows, thus suppressing weeds.<br />
                  Abnormal  soil reactions often aggravate weed competition.  It is therefore specific weed species suited  to different soil reactions exist with us, our crops grow best only in a specified  range of soil pH. Weeds would offer more intense competition to crops on normal  pH soils than on normal pH soils.<br />
                  <strong>f.  Climate </strong><br />
                  Adverse  weather condition, Eg. drought, excessive rains, extremes of temperature, will  favour weeds since most of our crop plants are susceptible to climatic  stresses.  It is further intensified when  crop cultivation is stratified over marginal lands.  All such stresses weaken crops inherent  capacity to fight weeds.<br />
                  <strong>g.  Time of germination </strong><br />
                  In  general, when the time of germination of crop coincides with the emergence of  first flush of weeds, it leads to intense Crop-Weed interference. Sugarcane  takes about one month to complete its germination phase while weeds require  very less time to complete its germination.<br />
                  Weed  seeds germinate most readily from 1.25 cm of soil and few weeds can germinate  even from 15cm depth.  Therefore,  planting method that dries the top 3 to 5 cm of soil rapidly enough to deny  weed seeds opportunity to absorb moisture for their germination usually postpones  weed emergence until the first irrigation.   By this time the crop plants are well established to compete with late  germinating weeds.<br />
                  <strong>h.  Cropping practices </strong><br />
                  Cropping  practices, such as method of planting crops, crop density and geometry and crop  species and varieties have pronounced effects on Crop-Weed interference.<br />
                  <strong>i.  Crop maturity</strong><br />
                  Maturity of the crop is yet  another factor which affects competition between weeds &amp; crop.  As the age of the crop increases, the  competition for weeds decreases due to its good establishment. Timely weeding  in the early growth stages of the crop enhances the yield significantly.<br />
                  <strong>Critical  period of weed competition </strong><br />
                  Critical period of weed  competition is defined as the shortest time span during the crop growth when  weeding results in highest Economic returns.<br />
                The  critical period of crop-weed competition is the period from the time of sowing  up to, which the crop is to be maintained in a weed free environment to get the  highest economical yield.  The weed  competition in crop field is invariably severe in early stages of crop than at  later stages.  Generally in a crop of 100  days duration, the first 35 days after sowing should be maintained in a weed  free condition. There is no need to attempt for a weed free condition throughout  the life period of the crop, as it will entail unnecessary additional  expenditure without proportionate increase in yield. Critical period of weed  competition for important crops ae as follows</p>
