				<p><strong>WEED  BIOLOGY</strong><br />
				  Weed  biology is the study of the establishment, growth, reproduction, and life  cycles of weed species and weed societies/vegetation. Weed biology is an  integrated science with the aim of minimizing the negative effects, as well as  using and developing the positive effects, of weeds. <br />
  <strong>Life  Cycle - </strong>Based on life  cycle weeds are classified as annuals, biennials or perennials. <br />
  <strong>Annuals</strong><br />
				  Annuals complete their life cycle  from seed in less than one year. There are two types: summer and winter  annuals. Summer annuals germinate in the spring, mature, produce flowers and  seeds and die before fall. Winter annuals germinate in the fall, overwinter in  a seedling or rosette stage, mature, produce flowers and seeds, and die in the spring  or early summer. Because of the seedling stage, annual weeds are generally easy  to control. There are usually few annual weeds present in lowbush blueberry  fields.<br />
  <strong>Biennials</strong><br />
				  Biennials generally complete their  life cycle over two years. The first year the seeds germinate and form a basal  cluster of leaves and a tap root. The plant overwinters in this stage. During  the second year the weed produces a flower stalk, sets seed and dies. Examples  of biennial weed are evening primrose and wild carrot. </p>

                <p><strong>Perennials</strong><br />
                  Perennial weeds live for more than  two years. These weeds are the most common in blueberry fields and generally  the most difficult to control. Perennial weeds may reproduce primarily by seed  (daisy); by both seed and roots (sheep sorrel); or primarily be vegetative  means (bunchberry). Many perennial weeds grow in the same manner as the  blueberry plant. Therefore, many of the production practices that promote  blueberry growth (e.g. pruning) also promote growth of these weeds. Perennials  which are low growing and spread vegetatively by interconnected underground  root systems are the most difficult to control. Perennial weeds growing above  the blueberries may be controlled by wiping or spot treatments with registered  herbicides. Perennial weeds include both woody and herbaceous species.<br />
  <strong>Growth Characters</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Based on growth characters weeds are classified  as grasses, broadleaf weeds, ferns and herbaceous or woody weeds.<br />
  <strong>Broadleaf</strong><br />
                  Broadleaf weeds are annual, biennial  or perennial plants which generally have two leaves (cotyledons) emerging upon  germination. The leaves normally have a branching network of veins and the  flowers have distinct petals.<br />
  <strong>Grasses,  Sedges and Rushes</strong><br />
                  Grasses can be annual or perennial  plants. They generally have narrow, upright, parallel-veined leaves. Grasses  have jointed stems, usually hollow at the internodes and are circular in cross  section.<br />
                  Sedges are a large group of  perennial (rarely annual) grass-like plants which are common in wet, poorly  drained soils. Sedge stems are triangular in cross section, solid, and not  jointed.<br />
                  Rushes are annual or perennial  plants similar in appearance to sedges with grass-like tufted leaves common at  the plant base. Rush stems are hollow, circular in cross section, and not  jointed. Like the sedge, this plant is also common in wet areas or poorly  drained soil, but is also found in woodland and open field<br />
  <strong>Ferns</strong> <br />
                  Ferns are primitive perennial plants  that do not produce flowers and seeds. Ferns consist of a leaf or frond, a  stalk and an expanded blade which may then be further subdivided several times.  Ferns spread by long creeping rhizomes and/or by spores.</p>

                <p><strong>Reproductive  Strategy</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Based on reproductive strategy weeds are classified as seed,  vegetative reproduction.</p>
                <h3>Reproduction by seed</h3>
                <p>            Reproduction by seed is called  sexual reproduction. It requires the fertilization of an egg by sperm, usually  in the form of pollen. Pollination of the egg in a flower results in seed that  is capable of producing a new plant. Seed production varies greatly among and  within weed species in part due to environmental variability between years,  competition from neighboring plants, and genetic variability.<br />
                  Through sexual reproduction abundant  and small seeds are produced.  Annual and  biennial weeds depend on seed production, as the sole means of propagation and  survival of perennial weeds are less dependent on this mechanism. For example,  while Canada thistle has been observed to produce as few as 680 seeds per plant,  curly dock often produces more than 30,000 seeds per plant.<br />
                  The  seed production capacity of some of the weeds is </p>

                <p>            A  few weeds may produce seed through apomixis i.e without fertilization. Eg.  Ferns reproduce by spores.</p>
                <p><strong>Vegetative Reproduction</strong><br />
                  In vegetative (asexual)  reproduction, a new plant develops from a vegetative organ such as a stem,  root, or leaf. Several modifications of these organs are common in perennial  weeds, such as underground stems (rhizomes), above-ground stems (stolons),  bulbs, corms, and tubers. Although vegetative structures generally do not  survive as long in the soil as do seeds, very small structures can result in a  new plant. Vegetative reproduction can be as prolific as seed production. <br />
                  Weed  Ecology<br />
                  Weed ecology is the study of the  interaction or relationship between a weed and its environment (other living  organisms as well as abiotic factors). Ecology is concerned with growth characteristics and  adaptations that enable weeds to survive the change in the environment. Man  plays an important role in changing the environment by altering the crop  husbandry practices and by maintaining weed free monocrop or multicrop culture.  For effective weed control, the study on both biology and ecology of a weed  species are important. </p>
                <h3>The weed seedbank and seed  dormancy</h3>
                <p>            Not only can weed seed and  vegetative tissue travel great distances to infest new fields, but once in the  soil, weed seed can remain viable for many years. In any given location, the  weed seedbank contains a vast library of weed species and ecotypes that are  adapted to a great range of environmental conditions and are ready to germinate  given the proper signal. A study reported that a square foot of soil, 6 inches  deep, contained from 98 to 3,068 viable weed seeds. This represents between 4.3  million and 133 million viable seeds per acre.<br />
                  The amount of time that a seed is  capable of producing a seedling, or its viability, varies with weed species. In  the extreme, lotus (<em>Nelumbo nucifera)</em> seeds found in a Manchurian  lakebed were viable after 1,000 years. More commonly, the annual plant  jimsonweed (<em>Datura stramonium)</em> has over a 90 percent germination rate  after 40 years in the soil.<br />
                  Additionally, many weed seeds remain  dormant in the soil until the conditions for germination and survival are  appropriate for that particular seed. Dormancy is the seed's resting stage and  is the primary method of weed seed dispersal in time. Some weed seeds have seed  coats that are impermeable to water and/or oxygen or are mechanically  resistant. Others contain immature embryos or have a waiting period (called  after-ripening) that must be completed before the seed will germinate. Seed  dormancy is affected by environmental conditions, including temperature, light,  oxygen, and the presence of chemical inhibitors.</p>
                <p><strong>Seed  dormancy as survival mechanism</strong><br />
                  Weed  seeds possess a variety of special germination mechanisms adapted to changes in  temperature, moisture, aeration, exposure to light, depth of burial of seeds  etc., when conditions are unfavourable for germination, they can remain dormant  or delay germination. <br />
                  Conditions favourable for weeds seed germination  are</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Seeds  of many weeds require an exposure to light for germination.  This is regulated by bluish-green protein  pigment called phytochrome.</li>
                  <li>Many  weed seeds germinate under aerobic conditions while some require anaerobic  condition.  Soil turnover during  ploughing and other operations exposes the seeds to light and induces  germination.</li>
                  <li>Periodicity  of germination is another specialised germination mechanism. <em>Amaranths</em> spp have a definite pattern of  peaks of germination at regular intervals.</li>
                  <li>Summer  annuals favour higher temperature &amp; winter annuals germinate at lower  temperatures some weeds germinate freely throughout the year.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Seed  Dormancy</strong><br />
                  Dormancy is a state of seeds and buds in which they  are alive but not germinated.  If all  weed seeds were to germinate at one time, their seedlings could be  destroyed.  Dormancy allows storage of  millions of weed seeds in soil and enables them to grow in flushes over years.  In this context, the old gardeners saying &ldquo;<em>One year Seeding seven years Weeding</em>&rdquo; is  very appropriate.  In fact, weed seeds  have been found viable even after 20-80 years of burial in soil. Weed seeds  exhibit three types of dormancy.<br />
                  <strong>PERSISTANCE  OF WEEDS</strong><br />
                  Weeds are highly persistent* category of  plants. They existed even before the first seed of any crop was planted on  earth and they are with us even today, probably in larger number and with  greater vigour. This speaks ample of their highly persistent nature. If a mixed  growth of a crop and weeds is left to nature, soon there will be weeds all  over, with no ttrace of the crop plants. High persistence of weeds results from  their multifacet mechanisms. Important among these are:-<br />
                  (і)  Prolific Seed Production<br />
                  Most  weeds are prolific seed producers. For instance, the per plant seed production  capacity of <em>Cuscuta</em> spp. Wasd found  approximately 16,000; <em>Conyza</em>33,992; <em>Chenopodium  album</em>, 72,000; and <em>Amaranthus</em>,  196,000. Only in few instances of some perennial weeds, the seed production was  weak. Further, the immediate viability of weed seeds has been found to vary  from 6 to 78%. Thus, one can anticipate that in majority of cases even if a few  weedy plants escaped control measures in the field, they were sufficient to  produce enough seeds to continue their progency for years to come. It is  further interesting to note that weeds can set viable seeds even when they are  harvested before full maturity. Perennial sowthistle (<em>Sonchus arvensis</em>) can set viable seeds even when it is cut during  its flowering stage and kept in shade. Chickweed (<em>Stellaria media</em>) and purslane (<em>Portulaca  oleracea</em>) have also been found well adapted to premature flowering and seed  setting under adverse environment conditions. A wedy plant must produce some  seeds before it perishes under any stress of nature, may it be drought, biotic  pressure, disease or insect pest, etc. It is commonly observed that under  favourable conditions <em>Chenopodium album</em> may grow as much as 30-50 cm tall before it flowers and sets seeds. But in the  events of severe drought it may grow hardly 3 cm high, and still produce some  seeds before it withers.<br />

                <p>(іі)  Dormancy- of Weed Seeds and Other Propagules in Soil<br />
                  As  stated earlier, the majority of weed seeds lying below about 5 cm soil depth  remain dormant, and act as source for future flushes of weeds. Permanent  experiments laid out for up to 10 decades have shown that depending upon the  weed species, the weed seeds retained viability for 2 to 100 years, to  different levels. Perhaps, the oldest seed burial experiments were laid out in  1879 by late Dr. W. J. Beal in USA. The latest viability tests from these  experiments were reported by Kiviban and Bavdurski (1973). Thus, the soils,  both agricultural and otherwise, acted as &ldquo;reserve banks&rdquo; for the weed seeds  and their other propagules. The phenomenon of dormancy and consequent longevity  of weeds seeds in soils is a very important tool with weeds to ensure their  everlasting existence against all odds of nature (and man). If all weed seeds  present in the soil were to germinate at one time, a single tillage operation  could wipe these out of the scene. But contrary to it, only a fraction of weed  seeds present in any soil germinate at any ine time, leaving others to  germinate later. Also, a few weedy plants which escaped attention in a field  are often sufficient to recoup the seed banks in the soil. In this context, the  old gardener&rsquo;s saying. &ldquo;<em>One year seeding  is seven year&rsquo;s weeding</em>&rdquo;, still holds good.<br />
                  Within  the soil, weed seeds can remain dormant for three reasons, as follows:-<br />
                  (a) Enforced dormancy<br />
                  Enforced  dormancy in weed seeds is due to their placement deeper than 5 cm, resulting  usually from tillage of the field. Weed seeds under this kind of dormancy  germinate readily whenever these are restored to the top 3 to 5 cm layer of  soil by tillage, provided adequate soil moisture and congenial temperatures  were available in this zone of the soil. Enforced dormancy is a non-specific  character of the seeds and it is caused by the absence of red light (r) under  the ground, which otherwise induces germination in seeds by activating their  phytochrome system (P), comprising a responsive chromophore blue pigment  attached to the protein molecule in seeds. Far-red light (fr) deactivates the  system and thus induces dormancy in seeds.<br />

                  Red<br />
                  Cultivation  counters enforced dormancy by bringing the weeds to surface where they are  exposed to full sun-light spectrum, besides better aeration. Higher soil  temperature and NO3 content of surface soil may further help in  breaking the enforced seed dormancy.<br />
                  (b)  Innate dormancy<br />
                  Innate dormancy is a genetically  controlled character and it is a feature of specific weed seeds. Innate dormant  seeds will fail to germinate even if they were present in the top 3 to 5 cm  soil and adequate soil moisture and temperature conditions were provided to  them. Innate doemancy usually results for reasons of either hard seed coats,  like in <em>Setaria, Ipomoea,</em> and <em>Xanthium </em>spp.,or immature embryos, as  observed in <em>Polygonum, Juncus,</em> and <em>Eleocharis</em> spp. In certain weed seeds,  particularly those of xerophytic origin, the presence of specific germination  inhibitors is responsible for their innate dormancy. In nature the innate  dormancy of weed seeds is overcome with either passage of time, or under the  influence of some climatic pressure.<br />
                  (c)  Induced Dormancy<br />
                  Induced  dormancy results from some physiological change in otherwise non-dormant weed  seeds under the impact of factors like a marked rise in soil temperature,  increased CO2 content of the soil, low O2 pressures,  water logging, etc. Certain weed seeds, like those of wild oat (<em>Avena fatua</em>), exhibit all the three  kinds of dormancies.<br />
                  (ііі)  Vegetative Propagation<br />
                  Many  weeds are extremely persistent because of their ability to propagate by  vegetative means. When the above ground parts of such weeds are destroyed,  their deeply placed vegetative propagules put forth new shoots as soon as the  external stresses are removed and favourable conditions revive. Even if some  kind of deep tillage is employed in an attempt to destroy these, it will be a  futile exercise since fragments of the weed propagules get easily dispersed to  new areas where they initiate fresh colonies.<br />
                  (іv)  Rapid Dispersal<br />
                  Dispersal is a very important  means of persistence of weeds. It exposes them to different ecosystems so that  each weed species can choose its most favourable environment and put up a hard  struggle for existence in nature. Dispersal is the key factor in developing a  persistent weed population for every possible niche in the environment.  Dispersal aids persistence of weeds in proportion to the dispersal agents and  adaptations available to them.<br />
                  (v)  Inherent Hardiness<br />
                  To be widely successful a weed  species must adapt itself to diverse environmental conditions. Weeds seem to  possess some kind of built-in mechanism to survive against the vagaries of  nature, like extreme cold, heat, drought, biotic stress, and soil  abnormalities. This is inherent hardiness of weeds. It is hard to find weeds  damaged under a night&rsquo;s severe frost, or destroyed because of attack by some  insect pest, disease organism, or nematode. Weeds are rarely seen to either  develop chlorosis or any other mineral deficiency or toxicity symptoms, even  though the soil may be actually abnormal in its mineral composition. Also, poor  quality water declared unfit for irrigating crops, fails to injure weeds. In  fact, in crop fields all abnormal features of soil and water help weeds to grow  vigorously in spaces vacated by the stunted growth (or death) of the crop  plants. The mechanisms involved in this inherent hardiness of weeds are not  much known. Further, several weeds of tropical origin, e.g. <em>Cyperus</em> and <em>Amaranthus</em> spp., have the advantage of adopting C4 pathway  of CO2  fixation, which is  devoid of photorespiration. Several weeds have exceptionally high transpiration  efficiency, low nutrient requirements, and slow rates of translocation of food  and minerals. Such adaptations in weeds help them to persist in adverse weather  conditions. High rates of elongation in certain weeds, particularly in the  initial stages of growth, improve their competing ability and persistence. But  a common aspect of inherent hardiness of all weeds seems to be their numerous  generations of natural selection through climatic stresses in the struggle for  survival of the fittest. <br />
                  (vі)  Evasiveness<br />
                  Many a weed is capable of evading destruction by  animals and man because of their bitter taste, disagreeable odour, spiny  nature, and mimicry.<br />
                  (vіі)  Self Regeneration<br />
                  Weeds are self-sown plants. They  don&rsquo;t require any artificial, friable seedbeds for their germination. Detached  from the mother plants, weed seeds and other propagules germinate profusely on  undisturbed soils whenever the environment is favourable for the purpose.<br />
                  (vііі)  Selective Invasion<br />
                  Weed species differ widely in  their soil and climatic requirements. But in the first instance, the weed flora  composition depends upon the chance a particular weed had to reach a particular  site. The nature then makes a critical selection out of the lot and allows only  those weed seeds to germinate at a time which were most adapted to the  environment prevailing then. The seeds of rest of the weed species wait in soil  till the environment outside changes. At this stage, suddenly another set of  weed species takes over the ground. The major environment factors which  determine the weed species composition on the ground comprise the available  soil moisture, soil pH, temperature, photoperiod, and solar energy. To cite  some examples, in a typical dry farming situation the weed flora often  comprises moisture hardy species like <em>Tribulus  terrestris, Argemone mexicana, Eragrostis cilianesis, Euphorbia hirta,</em> <em>Celosia argenta,</em> and <em>Heliotropium eichwaldii</em>. When such  fields are brought under irrigation, soon these weed species are replaced by  the better moisture responsive weeds like <em>Trianthema  monogyna, Phalaris minor, Asphodellus tenuifolius, Malva parviflora, Commelina  benghalensis,</em> and <em>Brachiaria ramose,</em> depending upon the season. Further, if such fields are irrigated still more  intensively and turned into paddy fields by ponding the water, there shall be  another shift in weed species. In this situation weeds like <em><u>Echinochloa, Caesulina, Butomus,</u></em> and <em>Eclipta</em> spp. will dominate the  scene. Likewise, weds in sugarbeet grow on salty soils are specific to such soils,  for instance, <em>Chenopodium murale, Salsola  kali, Taraxacum officinale, Polygonum</em> spp. and <em>Distichalis stricta</em>. Weed species also get specific to soil  texture. For instance, <em>Celosia argenta</em> and <em>Tribulus terrestris</em> are dominant  on sandy and light texture soils, but weeds like <em>Trianthema monogyna</em> and <em>Amaranthus  viridis  </em>infest heavy and fine  texture soils. Weed species also differ with the microclimate offered by a  particular crop. For instance, <em>Coronopus  didymus</em> and <em>Cichorium intybus </em>prefer  closely sown and frewquently irrigated crops like Lucerne and berseem, and they  avoid open row crops like chickpea and mustard. Likewise, an early sown crop is  likely to be infested with weed flora that is quite different from a timely or  late sown crop in the same place. Climatic and seasonal changes in an  environment also force rapid diversion in the weed flora towards the most  adapted species. <em>To sum up, weeds are  able to dominate in every situation by choosing and putting forth the most  befitting species</em>. The mechanism of such an armour available to weeds seems  to be a perfect, remote sensing system, leading to their observed persistence.<br />
                  (іx)  Weed Succession:<br />
                  In nature, the individuals of a weed species  often have chance to cross breed to variable levels. This leads to the  development of a few plants of different genetic make-up, forming new races  within a species. Such races of weeds are called agricultural  ecotypes. When  herbicides (or bioagents) are used continuously to destroy the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; races  of a weed species, their newly developed ecotypes may sometimes prove tolerant  to the herbicides used, whence they get chance to gradually expand in numbers,  each season.<br />
                  Such  agricultural ecotypes are then called chemotypes. The chemotypes greatly aid a  weed species to persist.<br />
                  Weed  succession can also occur amongst different weed species themselves in response  to long term adoption of an agricultural practice, including the use of  herbicides. This leads to the destruction of the susceptible group of weed  species, leaving behind few plants of the resistant species to gradually build  up their population and finally emerge as the dominant weed flora of the area.  In India, several example3 of this kind have been recorded in recent years.  Singh <em>et al </em>(1993) reported that in the  Punjab, in wheat fields, population of <em>Avena  fatua </em><br />
  &lsquo;wild oat&rsquo; was on increase because  of several years&rsquo; herbicidal control of <em>Phalaris  minor</em>. Likewise, in paddy fields,the continuous use of butachlor has led to  increase in the tolerant weed, <em>Ischaemum  regosum, </em>wrinkle grass&rsquo;. In Tamil Nadu, the repeated use of butachlor in  paddy fields has led to increase in <em>Cyperus  rotundus</em>, &lsquo;nut sedge&rsquo; and some other perennial weeds. Likewise, in West  Bengal, <em>Echinochloa </em>spp. &lsquo;barnyard  grass&rsquo; is no more a major wed since it is being replaced fast by weeds like <em>Cyperus, Scirpus, Fimbristylis, Eleocharis,</em> and <em>Sphenocloa</em> spp. In Jabalpur  (Madhya Pradesh), in a similar situation herbicidal control in rice was  reported to have enhanced population of <em>Sehima  nervosum,Cyperus iria</em>, and <em>C.</em> <em>communis. </em>Similarly, at Palampur  (Himachal Pradesh) long term adoption of paddy-wheat sequence has led to the  march of weeds like <em>Polypogon,  Alopecurus, </em>and <em>Poa</em> spp. In wheat  fields in North India, in general, the long term use of 2,4-D in wheat fields  has led to switch over to comparatively tolerant weeds like <em>Lathyrus, Anagallis, Melilotus, Convolvulus,  Medicagr, Cirsium,</em> and <em>Rumex </em>spp.  Also, the continued use of isoproturon to control certain grasses in wheat  fields has given boost to tolerant weeds like <em>Anagallis, Digitaria</em>, and <em>Medicago </em>spp. Thus, weed succession is a very important tool in the persistence of  weeds against all hurdles placed by the farmer. Even a long term change of a  crop or cropping practice will lead to shift in the weed flora composition.<br />
                  Finally,  the overall persistence of a weed depends upon its capability to adopt one or  more of the above cited features. A weed species that embodies majority of  these factors is surely a horrible weed, for instance, <em>Sorghum halepense</em> and <em>Saccharum  spontaneum.</em></p>
