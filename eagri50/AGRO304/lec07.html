				<p>Herbicides  are chemicals capable of killing or inhibiting the growth of plants. In the  last 40 years or so, man has greatly improved upon his weeding efficiency by  supplementing the conventional weeding methods with herbicides. It has saved  farmers of undue, repeated inter-cultivations and hoeing, and has helped him in  obtaining satisfactory weed control where physical methods often fail. Today,  we have over 1501 herbicides in common use for selective and non-selective weed  control in different areas. These chemicals vary greatly in their (a) molecular  structures, (b) mobility within plants, (c) selectivity, (d) fate in soils, and  (e) response to environment. Important properties and uses of some common  herbicides in use today are discussed later in Chapter 13.<br />
            Many chemicals have shown high codes  of selectivity to certain crops, killing the weeds effectively. But proper  selection of the herbicide, its rate, time, and method of application are very  important to obtain the desire degree of weed control and crop selectivity.<br />
            Herbicides are tools, and tool must  be used with care. Many developing nations have made a good beginning in the  use of herbicides in agriculture, but more comprehensive research needs to be  done before extending it to new situations.<br />
<strong>Benefits of Herbicides</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>Herbicides were developed in the  western world primarily to overcome the shortage of farm labour for weeding  crops. However, during the past four decades, slowly the utility of herbicides  has also been realized in the labour-rich tropical world, for varied reasons.  Given adequate labour and money to remove weeds manually, still many advantages  accrue from the judicious use of herbicides. Important among these are the  following:-<br />
1. In  monsoon season incessant rainfall may make physical weeding infeasible.  Herbicides can be used to ensure freedom of crops from weeds under such a  condition. Also, during the early crop growth period when many fields need weeding  simultaneously, even in labour-rich countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,  Nepal, Nigeria, and  Sudan, there is  certainly a weeding bottleneck in crop production. The soil applied herbicides  can be of great help in these regions in boosting crop production.<br />
2.  Herbicides can be employed to control weeds as they emerge from the soli to  eliminate weed crop interference even at a very early stage of crop growth. But  by physical methods weeds are removed after they have offered considerable  competition to the crops, and rarely at the critical time. Thus, herbicides  provide benefits of timely weed control.<br />
3.  Herbicides can kill many weeds that survive by mimicry, for example, wildoat (<em>Avena</em> spp.) in wheat and barnyardgrass (<em>Echinochola </em>spp.) in rice. Weeds that  resemble crop plants usually escape physical weeding.<br />
4.  Herbicidal control does not dictate strict row spacing’s. In physical weed  control, on the other hand, the crop rows have to be sufficiently wide to  accommodate weeding implements, else hand weeding and hand-pulling of weeds has  to be resorted to.<br />
5.  Herbicides bring about longer lasting control of perennial weeds and brushes  than is possible with any physical control method. Many modern herbicides can  translocate considerably deep in the underground system of weeds and damage  them.<br />
6.  Herbicides are convenient to use on spiny weeds which cannot be reached  manually.<br />
            When cultivators or hoes are worked  hard in an attempt to uproot the established weeds, they may cut many feeding  roots of a crop like maize, which are appreciable in the first 10 cm depth of  the soil. Their lateral growth fully occupies the inter-row spaces.\<br />
7.  Herbicides are safe on erodible lands where tillage may accelerate soil and  water erosion. Excessive tillage, in any case, spoils soil structure, reduces  organic matter content, and depletes moisture status of the soil.<br />
8.  Herbicides kill weeds in <em>situ</em> without  permitting their dissemination. Tillage on the other hand, may fragment the  vegetative propagules of the weeds and drag them to new sites.<br />
9.  Herbicide sprays easily reach the weeds growing in obstructed situations, such  as utility-right-of-way, under fruit trees, and on undulating lands.<br />
            Some other benefits of using  herbicides include (a) fewer labour problems, (b) greater possibility of farm  mechanization, (c) easier crop harvesting and (d) lower cost of farm produce.  In dry land agriculture, effective herbicidal control ensures higher water use  by crops and less crop failures due to drought.<br />
 <strong>Limitations  of Herbicides</strong><br />
            Like any other method of weed  control, herbicides have their own limitations. But with proper precautions  these limitations can be overcome, markedly. Important limitations in the use  of herbicides are as follows.<br />
1. In  herbicidal control there is no automatic signal to stop a farmer who may be  applying the chemical inaccurately till he sees the results in the crops  sprayed or in the rotation crops that follow.<br />
2.  Even when herbicides are applied accurately, these may interact with  environment to produce un-intended results. Herbicide drifts, wash-of, and  run-off can cause considerable damage to the neighbouring crops, leading to  unwarranted quarrels.<br />
3.  Depending upon the diversity in farming, a variety of herbicides must be  stocked on a farm to control weeds in different fields. On the contrary, for  physical control of weeds a farmer has to possess only one or two kinds of  weeding implements for his entire farm.<br />
4.  Above all, herbicidal control requires considerable skill on the part of the  user. He must be able to identify his weeds and possess considerable knowledge  about herbicides and their proper usages. Sometimes, an error in the use of  herbicides can be very costly.<br />
5. In  herbicide treated soils, usually, crop failures cannot be made up by planning a  different crop of choice. The selection of the replacement crop has to be based  on its tolerance to the herbicide already applied.<br />
6.  Military use of herbicides is the greatest misfortune of their discovery. In  Vietnam, 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, for example, were used for defoliating forests and  crops, leading to miseries to the innocent civilians. In future, the chemical  warfare with residual herbicides may be even more devastating, which must be  avoided at all costs.<br />
<strong>BIOLOGICAL  CONTROL</strong><br />
            Use of living organism’s viz.,  insects, disease organisms, herbivorous fish, snails or even competitive plants  for the control of weeds is called biological control.  In biological control method, it is not  possible to eradicate weeds but weed population can be reduced. This method is  not useful to control all types of weeds. Introduced weeds are best targets for  biological control.</p>
                <p><strong>Qualities of bio-agent</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>The  bio-agent must feed or affect only one host and not other useful plants</li>
                  <li>It  must be free of predators or parasites.</li>
                  <li>It  must readily adapt to environment conditions.</li>
                  <li>The  bio-agent must be capable of seeking out itself to the host.</li>
                  <li>It  must be able to kill the weed or atleast prevent its reproduction in some  direct or indirect way.</li>
                  <li>It  must possess reproductive capacity sufficient to overtake the increase of its  host species, without too much delay. </li>

                <ol start="2" type="a">
                  <li>Insects kill the plants by exhausting plant food       reserves, defoliation, boring and weakening structure of the plant.</li>
                  <li>Pathogenic organisms damage the host plants through       enzymatic degradation of cell constituents, production of toxins,       disturbance of harmone systems, obstruction in the translocation of food       materials and minerals and malfunctioning of physiological processes.</li>

                  <li>Herbivorous fish Tilapia controls algae.  Common carp, a non-herbivorous fish       controls sub-mersed aquatic weeds. It is apparently due to uprooting of       plants while in search of food. Snails prefer submersed weeds.</li>

                <p><strong>Bio-Herbicides/ Mycoherbicides</strong><br />
                  <strong>Defn:</strong>   The use of plant pathogen which are expected to kill the targeted weeds. <br />
                  These  are native pathogen, cultured artificially and sprayed just like post-emergence  herbicides each season on target weed, particularly in crop areas.     Fungal pathogens of weed have been used to a  larger extent than bacterial, viral or nematode pathogens, because, bacteria  and virus are unable to actively penetrate the host and require natural opening  or vectors to initiate disease in plants.<br />
                  Here the specific fungal spores or  their fermentation product is sprayed against the target weed. Some registered  mycoherbicides in western countries are tabulated below.<strong></strong></p>
