				<p>In  the past 50 years much has been learned about the use of herbicides and about  their strengths and weaknesses. After 50 years, it is an appropriate time to  re-evaluate their role in agriculture. The use of herbicides is increasing day  by day. This is because the other alternative control measures do not provide  an effective and economic substitute for herbicides in many situations. The  efficacy and safety of herbicides are greatly influenced by soil and climate.  These vary greatly between countries as does the legislation controlling their  use.<br />
                <strong>Advantages of herbicides</strong></p>
                <p><strong>On weed control</strong></p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>They       kill unwanted plants.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>They       are easy to use</li>
                  <li>Herbicides       can be used on closely planted crops where other methods cannot be used. </li>
                  <li>Most       of the time one application of the herbicide is enough whereas other       methods have to be continually used. </li>
                  <li>They       work fast. They can be removed quickly in critical situations. </li>
                  <li>Herbicides       are relatively cheap, and most of the time cheaper than manual weeding. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>On crop growth </strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>They can destroy plants bearing diseases.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>They help the crops grow by destroying the  weed that causes harmful effects which include competition for water, nutrients  and light; interference of weeds with crop growth by the release of toxins;  modification of soil and air temperatures and the harbouring of pests. </li>
                  <li>They can be safely used as the manual and  mechanical removing of weeds can destroy the crop.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Others</strong></p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>They       are relatively safe on lands which may erode.</li>
                  <li>Non-selective       herbicides can effectively clear fields, where houses and roads can then       be built. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Disadvantages of herbicides</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Effects of Herbicides on environment</strong><br />
                Herbicides vary greatly in chemical  composition and in the degree of threat they pose to the environment. Many of  the herbicides are highly persistant. It is widely recognised that the main  reason accounting for residues of certain herbicides like simazine and other  triazines in ground and surface water was the widespread use of these herbicides  at high doses on hard surfaces. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Some herbicides are non-biodegradable  and are harmful for a long period of time. Heavy dose of herbicides affect  microbial population of the soil. With herbicides targeting amino acid  synthesis in both plants and microbes, there is a possibility that N2 fixation  may be inhibited by the application of certain herbicides.</li>
                  <li><strong>Water:</strong> The improper use of pesticides and  herbicides may also cause the storm water infiltration into groundwater. When  these pesticides and herbicides contaminants dissolve in storm water they  infiltrate the groundwater and then the surface waters, such as ponds, streams,  rivers and lakes. These chemicals may also find their way into the soil and  deeper groundwater units polluting them. </li>
                  <li><strong>Living organisms:</strong> Most herbicides are specifically plant poisons, and are not very toxic to  animals. However, by changing the vegetation of treated sites, herbicide use  also changes the <a href="http://science.jrank.org/pages/3184/Habitat.html">habitat</a> of birds, mammals, insects, and  other animals through changes in the nature of their habitat. Herbivores may  eat the plants treated with herbicides and then carnivores eat the herbivores.  The toxic herbicide would be passed up the food chain increasing in concentration  each time resulting in cancers and even deaths.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>            Anxiety about chemical residues in  the environment has increased greatly in the last decade. These fears and  concern about possible litigation have led many land managers to reappraise  their weed control strategies. Change has also been forced on them by the  decrease in the number of approved herbicides as a result of the high cost of  registration. In addition, approval has been withdrawn from more toxic and  persistent herbicides.<br />
                  <strong>Effects of Herbicides on Humans</strong><br />
                  Among the many effects of pesticides  and herbicides, perhaps the most alarming is the danger they pose to human  health. People are directly affected by toxicity of some herbicides, during the  course of their occupation (i.e., when spraying <a href="http://science.jrank.org/pages/3305/Herbicides-Environmental-effects-herbicide-use.html" target="undefined">pesticides</a><br />
                  ), or  indirectly affected when exposed through drift or residues on food, and  wildlife. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Pesticides  and herbicides can cause a number of health problems such as heart congestion,  lung and kidney damage, low blood pressure, muscle damage, weight loss and  adrenal glands damage.</li>
                  <li>Arbitrary  and indiscriminate usage of herbicides and pesticides can result in  endometriosis, a common cause of infertility in women. </li>
                  <li>Herbicides  and pesticides have been suspected by the National Cancer Research Institute as  a probable cause of certain cancers (i.e., cancers of the brain, prostrate,  stomach and lip, as well as leukemia, skin melanomas, etc.) especially among  farmers.</li>
                  <li>The  National Academy of Sciences reported that infants and children, because of  their developing physiology, are susceptible to the negative effects of  herbicides and pesticides in comparison to adults.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Effect of herbicides on crop plant</strong><br />
                  An important problem with broadcast  applications is that they are non-selective. They are toxic to a wide variety  of plant species, and not just the weeds. If herbicides are not used properly,  damage may be caused to crop plants, especially if too large dose is used, or  if spraying occurs during a time when the crop species is sensitive to the  herbicide. Unintended but economically important damage to crop plants is  sometimes a consequence of the inappropriate use of herbicides.</p>
                <p><strong>Build-up of resistant biotypes</strong></p>
                <p>            Apart  from their effect on the environment, another major problem with herbicides has  been the build-up of herbicide-resistant biotypes where the same herbicide has  been used repeatedly for a number of years. This problem was not clearly  foreseen at the start of the herbicide revolution but, since the early 1980s,  triazine resistance has developed in most countries where these herbicides have  been used. The usefulness of a number of other herbicides, including paraquat,  dichlofopmethyl and sulfonylurea types has been affected by the development of  resistant biotypes. </p>
                <p>            Methods of dealing with this problem  include prevention of weed seed shedding, crop rotation, herbicide rotation,  control of weed escapes and tillage practices. Crop rotation is not relevant in  an amenity situation where the &lsquo;crops&rsquo; are usually perennial but other control  measures may be appropriate in certain situations. If weeds are prevented from  setting seed, resistant biotypes cannot develop.<br />
                  This could be achieved if land  managers were made more aware of the threat of resistant biotypes and made  greater efforts in intensively managed areas to prevent weeds from shedding  seeds by the use of a rotation of herbicides supplemented by physical means  such as mulching, hand hoeing and hand weeding.<br />
                  Modern, intensively managed  agricultural and forestry systems have an intrinsic reliance on the use of  herbicides and other pesticides. Unfortunately, the use of herbicides and other  pesticides carries risks to humans through exposure to these potentially toxic  chemicals, and to ecosystems through direct toxicity caused to non-target  species, and through changes in habitat. Nevertheless, until newer and more  pest-specific solutions to weed-management problems are developed, there will  be a continued reliance on herbicides in agriculture, forestry, and for other  purposes, such as <a href="http://science.jrank.org/pages/3305/Herbicides-Environmental-effects-herbicide-use.html" target="undefined">lawn care.</a><br />
