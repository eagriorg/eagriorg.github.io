				<h2>Nursery </h2>
                <p>            Apply any one of the Pre-emergence  herbicides viz., Butachlor 2 l/ha, Thiobencarb 2/ha, Pendimethalin 2.5 l/ha,  Anilofos 1.25 l/ha on 8th day after sowing to control weeds in the  lowland nursery. Keep a thin film of water and allow it to disappear. Avoid  drainage of water. This will control germinating weeds.</p>
                <h2>Transplanted </h2>
                <p><strong>Pre-emergence </strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Use  Butachlor 2.5 l/ha or Thiobencarb 2.5 l/ha or Fluchoralin 2 l/ha or  Pendimethalin 3 l/ha or Anilofos 1.25 l/ha as pre-emergence application.  Alternatively, pre-emergence application of herbicide mixture viz., Butachlor  1.2 l + 2,4-DEE 1.5 l/ha or Thiobencarb 1.2 l + 2,4-DEE 1.5 l/ha or Fluchoralin  1.0 l + 2,4-DEE 1.5 l/ha or Pendimethalin 1.5 l + 2,4-DEE 1.5 l/ha or Anilofos  + 2,4-DEE ready mix at 1.25 l/ha followed by one hand weeding on 30-35 days  after transplanting will have a broad spectrum of weed control in transplanted  rice.</li>
                  <li>Any  herbicide has to be mixed with 50 kg of sand on the day of application (3-4  days after transplanting) and applied uniformly to the field in 2.5 cm depth of  water. Water should not be drained for 2 days from the field or fresh  irrigation should not be given.</li>
                  <li>Wherever  there is possibility of heavy weed infestation, herbicides can also be applied  with neem coated urea which could serve as carrier, three to four days after  transplanting instead basal application of N at last puddling.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Post-emergence</strong><br />
                  If pre-emergence herbicides are not  used, hand weed on 15th day after transplanting. 2,4-D sodium salt  (Fernoxone 80% WP) 1250 g dissolved in 625 l/ha of water is sprayed with a high  volume sprayer, three weeks after transplanting or when the weeds are in 3-4  leaf stage.</p>
                <h5>Late hand weeding</h5>
                <p>            Hand  weed a second time, 80-85 days after transplanting, if necessary.<br />
                  <strong>Wet seeded rice </strong><br />
                  In wet seeded rice apply Thiobencarb  at 2.5 l/ha or Pretilachlor 0.9 l/ha on 4DAS/6DAS/8DAS followed by one hand  weeding for effecrtive control of weeds OR Pre-emergence application of  Pretilachlor + safener at 0.6 l/ha on 4DAS followed by one hand weeding on 40  DAS effectively control weeds.<br />
  <strong>Rainfed rice </strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>First  weeding should be done between 15th and 20th day and  second weeding may be done 45 days after first weeding. or</li>
                  <li>Use  Thiobencarb 2.5 l/ha or Pendimethalin 3 l/ha 8 days after sowing if adequate  moisture is available, followed by one hand weeding on 30 to 35 days after  sowing.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Direct seeded rice </strong><br />
                  Thiobencarb/Butachlor at 2.5 l/ha as  pre-emergence application one day after wetting / soaking can be applied and it  should be followed by hand weeding on 30th day. Sufficient soil  moisture should be available for herbicidal use<br />
  <strong>Semi dry rice </strong><br />
                  Use Thiobencarb 3 l/ha or  Pendimethalin 4 l/ha on 8th day after sowing as sand mix if adequate  moisture is available, followed by one hand weeding on 30-35 days after sowing.<br />
                  Or<br />
                  Pre-emergence application of  pretilachlor 0.6 l/ha followed by post emergence application of 2,4-D Na salt  1.25 kg/ha + one hand weeding on 45DAS.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>SORGHUM</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Apply  the pre-emergence herbicide Atrazine 50% WP 500 g/ha on 3 days after sowing as  spray on the soil surface, using Backpack/knapsack/Rocker sprayer fitted with a  flat fan nozzle using 900 lit of water/ha</li>
                  <li>Sorghum  is slow growing in early stages and is adversely affected by weed competition.  Therefore keep the field free of weeds upto 45days. For this, after  pre-emergence herbicide application, one hand weeding on 30-35 days after  sowing may be given.</li>
                  <li>If  pulse crop is to be raised as an intercrop in sorghum do not use Atrazine.</li>
                  <li>Hoe  and hand weed on the 10th day of transplanting if herbicides are not  used. Hoe and weed between 30-35 days after transplanting and between 35-40  days for direct sown crop, if necessary.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Ratoon sorghum </strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Remove  the weeds immediately after harvest of the main crop</li>
                  <li>Hoe  and weed twice on 15th and 30th day after cutting</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Rainfed sorghum </strong><br />
                  Keep sorghum field free of weeds  from second week after germination till 5th week. If sufficient  moisture is available spray Atrazine @ 500 g/ha as pre-emergence  application  within 3 days after the  soaking rainfall for sole sorghum while for sorghum based inter-cropping system  with pulses, use Pendimethalin 3 l/ha.</p>

                <h2>Transplanted crop</h2>
                <p>            Spray Atrazine 50 WP 500 g/ha on 3rd  day of sowing. Then, one hand weeding on 30-35 days after transplanting may be  given. If herbicide is not used, hand weed on 15th day and again  between 30-35 days after transplanting.</p>

                  First hand weeding taken up three  weeks after planting. A spade digging is followed on 45 DAT which makes the  ridges flat and then reformed one week later to have good weed control.<br />

                  Remove as and when the shoot appears  above the ground level before flowering and seed set. The removed shoots are to  be buried or burnt. Trap cropping of greengram or gingelly or sorghum reduces  the infestation.<br />

                  Pre-emergence application of  Fluchloralin at 1.0 lit/ha or Oxyfluorfen at 0.5 lit/ha one week prior to  planting controls most of the weeds.</p>
