				<p>Simultaneous or sequential application of  herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, antidotes, fertilizers etc., is followed  in a single cropping season. These chemicals may undergo a change in physical  and chemical characters, which could lead to enhancement or reduction in the  efficacy of one or more compounds.  The  interaction effects were seen much later in the growing season or in the next  season due to build up of persistent chemicals or their residues in the soil.  Knowledge on the interactions of various chemicals can be helpful in the  formulation and adoption of a sound and effective plant protection  programme.  It can also help to exploit  the synergistic and antagonistic interactions between various pesticides for an  effective eradication of weed and other pest problems.<br />
            When two or more chemicals  accumulate in the plant, they may interact and bring out responses. These  responses are classified as additive, synergistic, antagonistic, independent  and enhancement effects.<br />
<strong>i) Additive effect:</strong> It is the total effect of a  combination, which is equal to the sum of the effects of the components taken  independently.<br />
<strong>ii) Synergistic effect:</strong> The total effect of a combination is  greater or more prolonged than the sum of the effects of the two taken  independently. Eg. The mixture of 2,4-D and chlorpropham is synergistic on  monocot species generally resistant to 2,4-D. Similarly, low rates of 2,4-D and  picloram have synergistic response on <em>Convolvulus  arvensis. </em> Atrazine and alachlor  combination, which shows synergism is widely used for an effective control in  corn.<br />
<strong>iii) Antagonistic effect:</strong> The total effect of a combination is  smaller than the effect of the most active component applied alone. Eg.  Combination of EPTC with 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T or dicamba have antagonistic responses  in sorghum and giant foxtail.  Similarly,  chlorpropham and 2,4-D have antagonism. When simazine or atrazine is added to  glyphosate solution and sprayed the glyphosate activity is reduced.  This is due to the physical binding within  the spray solution rather than from biological interactions within the plant.<br />
<strong>iv) Independent effect: </strong>The total effect of a combination is  equal to the effect of the most active component applied alone.<br />
<strong>v)Enhancement effect:</strong> The effect of a herbicide and non-toxic adjuvant applied in combination on a  plant is said to have an enhancement effect if the response is<strong> </strong>greater than that obtained when the  herbicide is used at the same rates without the adjuvant. Eg. Mixing Ammonium  sulphate with glyphosate.</p>
               
                <p><strong>Herbicide-moisture interaction</strong><br />
                  Soil applied herbicides fail when  there is a dry spell of 10-15 days after their application. Pre-emergence  herbicides may be lost by photo-decomposition, volatilization and wind blowing  while some amount of water is desirable to activate the soil applied  herbicides, excess of it may leach the herbicide to the crop seed and root  zone.  This may injure the crops and on  other side, results in poor weed control.   Heavy showers may wash down herbicides from the foliage.<br />
                  Continuous wet weather may induce  herbicide injury in certain crops by turning them highly succulent. Eg. Maize  plants are normally tolerant to Atrazine but they become susceptible in wet  weather, particularly when air temperature is low.  Extra succulence has been found to increase  atrazine absorption and low temperature decreases its metabolism inside the  plants. Quality of water used may also determine herbicide action.  Dusty water reduces action of paraquat.  Calcium chloride rich water reduces glyphoste  phytotoxicity.</p>
                <p><strong>Herbicide-insecticide interaction</strong></p>
                <p>            These chemicals are usually not  harmful at recommended rates. The tolerance of plants to a herbicide may be  altered in the presence of an insecticide and vice versa.  The phyto-toxicity of monuron and diuron on  cotton and oats is increased when applied with phorate.  Phorate interacts antagonistically with  trifluralin to increase cotton yield, by stimulating secondary roots in the  zone of pesticide incorporation.<br />
                  Propanil interacts with certain  carbamate and phosphate insecticides used as seed treatments on rice.  But chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides as  seed treatment have not interacted with propanil. When propanil is applied at  intervals between 7 and 56 days after carbofuron treatment, it results in  greater injury to rice vegetatively.</p>
                <p><strong>Herbicide-pathogens / fungicides  interaction</strong></p>
                <p>Herbicides  interact with fungicides also. Dinoseb reduces the severity of stem rot in  groundnut.  In sterilized soil,  chloroxuron is not causing any apparent injury to pea plants, while in the  presence of <em>Rhizoctonia solani </em>in  unsterilized soil it causes injury. Oxadiazon reduces the incidence of stem rot  caused by the soil borne pathogen<em> Sclerotium rolfsii </em>L. in groundnut.   Diuron and triazine which inhibit photosynthesis may make the plants  more susceptible to tobacco mosaic virus.   On the other hand, diuron may decrease the incidence of root rot in  wheat.</p>
                <p><strong>Herbicide-fertilizer interaction</strong></p>
                <p>            Herbicides have been found to  interact with fertilizers in fields.   E.g., fast growing weeds that are getting ample nitrogen show great  susceptibility to 2,4-D, glyphosate than slow growing weeds on poor fertility  lands.  The activity of glyphosate is  increased when ammonium sulphate is tank mixed. Nitrogen invigorate (put life  and energy in to) the meristamatic activity in crops so much that they  susceptible to herbicides. High rates of atrazine are more toxic to maize and  sorghum when appled with high rates of phosphorus.</p>
                <h2>Herbicide-microbes interaction</h2>
                <p>            Microorganisms play a major role in  the persistence behaviour of herbicides in the soil.  The soil microorganisms have the capacity to  detoxify and inactivate the herbicides present in the soil. Some groups of  herbicides more easily degrade through microbes than others.  The difference lies in the molecular  configuration of the herbicide. The microorganisms involved in herbicide  degradation include bacteria, fungi, algae, moulds etc.  Of these, bacteria predominates and include  the members of the genera <em>Agrobacterium,  Arthrobacter, Achromobacterium.</em> <em>Bacillus,  Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Flavobacterium, Rhizobium </em>etc.  The fungi include those of the genera <em>Fusarium, Penicillium </em>etc.</p>
