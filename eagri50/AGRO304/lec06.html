				<p align="right"><img src="images/back.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="30" usemap="#Map" />
                  <map name="Map" id="Map2">
                    <area shape="rect" coords="1,1,168,30" href="index.html" alt="" />
                  </map>
				</p>
				<p>For designing any weed control  programme in a given area, one must know the nature &amp; habitat of the weeds  in that area, how they react to environmental changes &amp; how they respond to  herbicides.  Before selecting a method of  weed control one, much have information on the number of viable seeds nature of  dispersal of seeds, dormancy of seeds, longevity of buried seeds &amp; ability  to survive under adverse conditions, life span of the weed, soil textures  moisture and (In case of soil applied volatile herbicides the herbicide will be  successful only in sandy loam soil but not in clayey soil.  Flooding as a method of weed control will be  successful only in heavy soil &amp; net in sandy soil) the area to be  controlled. <br />
Principles  of weed control are;</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Prevention</li>
                  <li>Eradication</li>
                  <li>Control</li>
                  <li>Management</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Preventive  weed control<br />
                  It  encompasses all measures taken to prevent the introduction and/or establishment  and spread of weeds. Such areas may be local, regional or national in size. No  weed control programme is successful if adequate preventive measures are not  taken to reduce weed infestation. It is a long term planning so that the weeds  could be controlled or managed more effectively and economically than is  possible where these are allowed to disperse freely. Following preventive  control measures are suggested for adoption wherever possible &amp;  practicable.<br />
                  1. Avoid using  crop that are infested with weed seeds for sowing<br />
                  2. Avoid  feeding screenings and other material containing weed seeds to the farm  animals.<br />
                  3. Avoid  adding weeds to the manure pits.<br />
                  4. Clean the  farm machinery thoroughly before moving it from one field to another. This is  particularly important for seed drills<br />
                  5. Avoid the  use of gravel sand and soil from weed-infested<br />
                  6. Inspect  nursery stock for the presence of weed seedlings, tubers, rhizomes, etc.<br />
                  7. Keep  irrigation channels, fence-lines, and un-cropped areas clean<br />
                  8. Use  vigilance. Inspect your farm frequently for any strange looking weed seedlings.  Destroy such patches of a new weed by digging deep and burning the weed along  with its roots. Sterilize the spot with suitable chemical.<br />
                  9. Quarantine  regulations are available in almost all countries to deny the entry of weed  seeds and other propagules into a country through airports and shipyards.<br />
                  Weed  free crop seeds<br />
                  It  may be produced by following the pre-cautionary measures.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Separating crop seeds from  admixture of crop &amp; weed seeds using physical differences like size, shape,  colour, weight / texture &amp; electrical properties.</li>
                  <li>Using air-screen cleaners &amp;  specific gravity separators, which differentiate seeds based on seed size,  shape, surface area &amp; specific gravity.</li>
                  <li>Through means of Seed  certification we can get certified seeds and can be used safely because the  certified seeds contain no contaminant weed seeds</li>
                  <li>Weed laws are helpful in reducing  the spread of weed species &amp; in the use of well adapted high quality  seeds.  They help in protecting the  farmers from using mislabeled or contaminated seed and legally prohibiting  seeds of noxious weeds from entering the country.</li>
                  <li>Quarantine laws enforce isolation  of an area in which a severe weed has become established &amp; prevent the  movement of the weed into an uninfected area.</li>
                  <li>Use of pre-emergence herbicides  also helpful in prevention because herbicides will not allow the germination of  weeds.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>b.  Eradication:  (ideal weed control rarely  achieved)<br />
                  It  infers that a given weed species, its seed &amp; vegetative part has been  killed or completely removed from a given area &amp; that weed will not  reappear unless reintroduced to the area. Because of its difficulty &amp; high  cost, eradication is usually attempted only in smaller areas such as few  hectares or few thousand m2 or less.   Eradication is often used in high value areas such as green houses,  ornamental plant beds &amp; containers. This may be desirable and economical  when the weed species is extremely noxious and persistent as to make cropping  difficult and economical.<br />
                  c.  Control<br />
                  It encompasses those processes where by weed  infestations are reduced but not necessarily eliminated. It is a matter of  degree ranging from poor to excellent.   In control methods, the weeds are seldom killed but their growth is  severely restricted, the crop makes a normal yield.  In general, the degree of weed control  obtained is dependent on the characters of weeds involved and the effectiveness  of the control method used.<br />
                  d.  Weed management<br />
                  Weed  control aims at only putting down the weeds present by some kind of physical or  chemical means while weed management is a system approach whereby whole land  use planning is done in advance to minimize the very invasion of weeds in  aggressive forms and give crop plants a strongly competitive advantage over the  weeds.<br />
                  Weed  control methods are grouped into cultural, physical, chemical and biological.  Every method of weed control has its own advantages and disadvantages.  No single method is successful under all weed  situations.  Many a time, a combination  of these methods gives effective and economic control than a single method.<br />
  <strong>MECHANICAL WEED CONTROL</strong> <br />
  <center><img width="234" height="274" src="lec06_clip_image002.jpg" align="center" hspace="12" /></center></p>
                
                <p>Mechanical or physical methods of weed  control are being employed ever since man began to grow crops.  The mechanical methods include tillage,  hoeing, hand weeding, digging cheeling, sickling, mowing, burning, flooding,  mulching etc.<br />
                  <strong>1. Tillage</strong> <br />
                  Tillage removes weeds from the soil  resulting in their death. It may weaken plants through injury of root and stem  pruning, reducing their competitiveness or regenerative capacity.  Tillage also buries weeds.  Tillage operation includes ploughing,  discing, harrowing and leveling which is used to promote the germination of  weeds through soil turnover and exposure of seeds to sunlight, which can be  destroyed effectively later.  In case of  perennials, both top and underground growth is injured and destroyed by  tillage.<br />
                  <strong>2. Hoeing</strong> <br />
                  Hoe has been the most appropriate  and widely used weeding tool for centuries.   It is however, still a very useful implement to obtain results  effectively and cheaply.  It supplements  the cultivator in row crops.  Hoeing is  particularly more effective on annuals and biennials as weed growth can be  completely destroyed.  In case of  perennials, it destroyed the top growth with little effect on underground plant  parts resulting in re-growth.</p>
                
                <p><center><img width="305" height="240" src="lec06_clip_image004.jpg" align="center" hspace="12" /></center><strong> </strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>8. Flooding</strong> <br />
                  Flooding is successful against weed  species sensitive to longer periods of submergence in water.  Flooding kills plants by reducing oxygen  availability for plant growth.  The  success of flooding depends upon complete submergence of weeds for longer  periods.<br />

                  4)    Does not involve any skill<br />
                  5)    Weeding is possible in between plants</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Deep  rooted weeds can be controlled effectively</li>

                  <strong>Power rotary weeder</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>For  mechanical control of weeds in crops such as sugarcane, tapioca, cotton, tomato  and pulses whose rows spacing is more than 45 cm. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><center><img width="268" height="181" src="lec06_clip_image016.jpg" align="center" hspace="12" /><img width="242" height="181" src="lec06_clip_image018.jpg" align="center" hspace="12" /></center><strong> </strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>            </strong>The rotary weeder consists of  three rows of discs mounted with 6 numbers of curved blades in opposite  directions alternatively in each disc. These blades when rotating enable  cutting and mulching the soil. The width of coverage of the rotary tiller is  500 mm and the depth of operation can be adjusted to weed and mulch the soil in  the cropped field.<br />
                  <strong>Tractor  drawn weeding cum earthing up equipment</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>For&nbsp;&nbsp; weeding and intercultural operations  in between row crops in a single pass </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong> <center>    <img width="247" height="182" src="lec06_clip_image020.jpg" /> <img width="280" height="182" src="lec06_clip_image022.jpg" /></center></strong><br />
                  An inter cultivator cum earthing up equipment was developed  and fitted to a standard&nbsp;tractor drawn ridger. Three number of  sweep&nbsp;type blades are affixed to the&nbsp;ridger frame for accomplishing  the weeding operation in between standing rows of crops.&nbsp; Three ridger  bottom fitted behind the sweep blade, work on the loosened soil mass and aid in  earthing up by forming&nbsp;ridges and furrows. Weeding efficiency is 61 per  cent.&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;<strong> Tractor operated multi row rotary weeder</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><center><img width="273" height="184" src="lec06_clip_image024.jpg" align="center" hspace="12" /></center>For&nbsp;&nbsp; weeding and  intercultural operations in between row crops like sugarcane, cotton, maize,  etc. &nbsp;in a single pass </li>

                </ul>
                <p><strong> </strong>            The multi row rotary weeder consists of a set of cutting  blades, which penetrate in to the soil, removing the weeds in the crop rows.  The cutting blade has also been used as an inclined plane for elevating and  converging the soil. The rotating blades are used to cut the weeds and  pulverizing the soil. Weeding efficiency is 71 per cent. </p>
<p><strong>Cono weeder</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>For weeding  between rows of paddy crop</li>
                </ul>
                <p><center><img width="267" height="210" src="lec06_clip_image028.jpg" align="center" hspace="12" /><img width="259" height="198" src="lec06_clip_image030.jpg" align="center" hspace="12" /></center><strong>            </strong></p>
                
                <p>            The  cono weeder has two conical rotors mounted in tandem with opposite orientation.  Smooth and serrated blades mounted alternately on the rotor uproot and burry  weeds because the rotors create a back and forth movement in the top 3 cm of  soil, the cono weeder can satisfactorily weed in a single forward pass without  a push pull movement. It is easy to operate by a single operator. The weeder  does not sink in puddled soil. Field capacity 0.18 ha/day. Star, Peg type and  Twin hoe wheel weeding. <br />
                  <strong>CULTURAL WEED CONTROL</strong><br />
                  Several cultural practices like  tillage, planting, fertiliser application, irrigation etc., are employed for  creating favourable condition for the crop.   These practices if used properly, help in controlling weeds.  Cultural methods, alone cannot control weeds,  but help in reducing weed population.   They should, therefore, be used in combination with other methods.  In cultural methods, tillage, fertiliser  application. and irrigation are important.   In addition, aspects like selection of variety, time of sowing, cropping  system, cleanliness of the farm etc., are also useful in controlling weeds.<br />
  <strong>1. Field preparation</strong> <br />
                  The field has to be kept weed  free.  Flowering of weeds should not be  allowed.  This helps in prevention of  build up of weed seed population.<br />
  <strong>2. Summer tillage</strong> <br />
                  The practice of summer tillage or  off-season tillage is one of the effective cultural methods to check the growth  of perennial weed population in crop cultivation.  Initial tillage before cropping should  encourage clod formation.  These clods,  which have the weed propagules, upon drying desiccate the same.  Subsequent tillage operations should break  the clods into small units to further expose the shriveled weeds to the hot  sun.<br />
  <strong>3. Maintenance of optimum plant  population</strong> <br />
                  Lack of adequate plant population is  prone to heavy weed infestation, which becomes, difficult to control  later.  Therefore practices like  selection of proper seed, right method of sowing, adequate seed rate protection  of seed from soil borne pests and diseases etc. are very important to obtain  proper and uniform crop stand capable of offering competition to the weeds.<br />
  <strong>4. Crop rotation</strong> <br />
                  The possibility of a certain weed  species or group of species occurring is greater if the same crop is grown year  after year.  In many instances, crop  rotation can eliminate atleast reduce difficult weed problems. The obnoxious  weeds like <em>Cyperus rotundus</em> can be  controlled effectively by including low land rice in crop rotation.<br />
  <strong>5. Growing of intercrops</strong> <br />
                  Inter cropping suppresses weeds  better than sole cropping and thus provides an opportunity to utilize crops  themselves as tools of weed management. Many short duration pulses viz., green  gram and soybean effectively smother weeds without causing reduction in the  yield of main crop.<br />
  <strong>6. Mulching</strong> <br />
                  Mulch is a protective covering of  material maintained on soil surface.   Mulching has smothering effect on weed control by excluding light from  the photosynthetic portions of a plant and thus inhibiting the top growth.  It is very effective against annual weeds and  some perennial weeds like <em>Cynodon  dactylon. </em>Mulching is done by dry or green crop residues, plastic sheet or  polythene film. To be effective the mulch should be thick enough to prevent  light transmission and eliminate photosynthesis.<br />

                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>7. Solarisation</strong> <br />
                  This is another method of  utilisation of solar energy for the desiccation of weeds.  In this method, the soil temperature is  further raised by 5 – 10 ºC by covering a pre-soaked fallow field with thin  transparent plastic sheet.  The plastic  sheet checks the long wave back radiation from the soil and prevents loss of  energy by hindering moisture evaporation.<br />
  <center><img width="351" height="212" src="lec06_clip_image036.jpg" align="center" hspace="12" /></center></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>8. Stale seedbed</strong> <br />
                  A stale seedbed is one where initial  one or two flushes of weeds are destroyed before planting of a crop.  This is achieved by soaking a well prepared  field with either irrigation or rain and allowing the weeds to germinate.  At this stage a shallow tillage or non- residual  herbicide like paraquat may be used to destroy the dense flush of young weed  seedlings.  This may be followed  immediately by sowing.  This technique  allows the crop to germinate in almost weed-free environment.<br />
                  <strong>9. Blind tillage</strong> <br />
                  The tillage of the soil after sowing  a crop before the crop plants<strong> </strong>emerge  is known as blind tillage. It is extensively employed to minimise weed  intensity in drill sowing crops where emergence of crop seedling is hindered by  soil crust formed on receipt of rain or irrigation immediately after sowing.<br />
                  <strong>10. Crop management practices</strong><br />
                <strong>            </strong>Good crop management practices that  play an important role in weed control are</p>
                <ol start="1" type="a">
                  <li>Vigorous and fast growing crop varieties are better       competitors with weeds.</li>
                  <li>Proper placement of fertilizers ensures greater       availability of nutrients to crop plants, thus keeping the weeds at a       disadvantage.</li>
                  <li>Better irrigation practices to have a good head       start over the weeds</li>
                  <li>Proper crop rotation programme </li>
                  <li>Higher plant population per unit area results in       smothering effect on weed growth</li>
                </ol>
