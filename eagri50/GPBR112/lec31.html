				</p>
				<p><a name="A_definition_of_seed_marketing" id="A_definition_of_seed_marketing"><strong>A  definition of seed marketing</strong></a> <br />
          Seed marketing should aim to satisfy  the farmer's demand for reliable supply of a range of improved seed varieties  of assured quality at an acceptable price.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>To  the retailer in the agricultural sector, for example, it is selling seed along  with other inputs to the farmer. </li>
				  <li>To  the farmer it is simply selling what he produces on his farm. However, whatever  the circumstances, a well-defined sequence of events has to take place to  promote the product and to put it in the right place, at the right time and at  the right price for a sale to be made. </li>
				  <li>Too  many people think of marketing solely in terms of the advertising and selling  of goods, whereas in reality marketing starts long before the goods exist and  continues long after they are sold. Therefore, for the marketing process to be  successful: the farmer consumer's needs must be satisfied; the seed company's  objectives must be realized.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>MARKETING STRUCTURE</strong> <br />
                    <a name="Seed_distribution_systems" id="Seed_distribution_systems"><strong>Seed distribution  systems</strong></a> <br />
				  Seed  distribution can be carried out by government, public sector agencies, co-operatives  and the private sector or, as is often the case, by a combination of all of  these. Channels for seed marketing may be described as: <br />
  <strong>Direct <br />
</strong>          The  seed producing organization supplies the farmer directly. Some features of  direct channel distribution are:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>the  supplier has direct contact with the consumer</li>
				  <li>a  high level of service and customer support can be maintained</li>
				  <li>direct  control is maintained over the quality of the product</li>
			    </ul>
				<ul>
				  <li>the  upkeep of such a system can be expensive, with high fixed costs if a  </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>     sales force is employed</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>a  responsive management structure and well-motivated staff are required </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>     where  there are many staff involved in a direct sales organization there can   <br />
				  be an inbuilt inertia to change so the  system may lack flexibility.  </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>the  revenue necessary to pay for the high fixed costs will only come from   </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>     having a wide product range and achieving  good market shares or selling<br />
				  high value products such as horticultural  seeds.<br />
  <strong>Single level </strong><br />
				  The seed producing organization  supplies the farmer through independent retail outlets.  The main features of this system are that:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>the  seed supplier relies on the retailer for contact with the consumer</li>
				  <li>retail  networks require strong service and support from the supplier</li>
				  <li>good  administrative control must be provided by the sales management</li>
				  <li>the  supplier's distribution system must be well  organized and responsive</li>
				  <li>product  quality at the retail level must be monitored for deterioration and<br />
				    adulteration and a return system should be considered</li>
				  <li>although  the products may be well promoted, the supplier relies on the retailer to make  the final sale.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Multilevel </strong><br />
				  The seed producing organization supplies  a national distributor, wholesalers or regional distributors who, in turn,  supply sub-distributors or the retail outlets. <br />
				  This  system is characterized by:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>the  supplier having no direct contact with the consumer</li>
				  <li>products  being strongly promoted in order to create demand</li>
				  <li>supplying  seed to the distributors in sufficient time to achieve timely availability at  the retail level</li>
				  <li>management  ensuring that there is a good system of monitoring sales and obtaining feedback  from the consumer</li>
				  <li>the  distributor being interested only in the strongest selling lines.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>If  neither infrastructure nor the economy are well developed, national  distributors may simply not be available and the seed producer will have to  supply seed to regional wholesalers or distributors.<br />
                    <strong>Sources of seed available to farmers </strong> <br />
				  For farmers there are a number of  sources available for the purchase of seed. These are: <br />
  <strong>Direct sales </strong><br />
				  The seed producer supplies the farmer  directly from central seed stores and a network of his/her own supply points <br />
  <strong>Farmer producers </strong><br />
				  Farmers with seed production contracts  are licensed to supply other farmers within their zone of influence <br />
  <strong>Cooperatives <br />
  </strong>          Cooperatives  act as 'farmer producers' and/or as suppliers of inputs to members <br />
  <strong>Farmer dealers</strong><br />
				  Farmers act as dealers, supplying  their neighbours; this can evolve into a highly developed system <br />
  <strong>Commission agents </strong><br />
				  These work directly with the producer  or his/her intermediaries, passing on orders from the farmers <br />
  <strong>Grain  merchants</strong> <br />
				  Traders involved in the seed and grain  business who are also licensed seed producers <br />
  <strong>Crop  buyers </strong><br />
				  Collectors and crop or commodity  traders who provide a point of contact with farmers and can be used to market  seed <br />
  <strong>Retail  store dealers</strong><br />
				  Town and village dealers who retail a  range of agricultural inputs, with the larger operators possibly having  sub-dealers <br />
  <strong>Industrial  processors</strong><br />
				  Processors interested in specific  crops including oilseed crushers and vegetable canners, who may have an  interest in supplying seed as part of a growing contract or integrated  production system <br />
  <strong>Cold  store operators</strong><br />
				  Potato cold store operators trade  potato seed since they deal directly with the growers and have the appropriate  storage <br />
  <strong>Consumer  outlets </strong><br />
				  Garages, shops and supermarkets (are  best suited to display small packets of seed) <br />
  <strong>Mail  order </strong><br />
				  Suitable for low volume, high value  products such as vegetables and flowers.<br />
				  Although government extension outlets  are not strictly retail outlets, seed is sometimes supplied to the farmer  through government sponsored agencies and departments which administer crop or  regional development and credit programmes.<br />
  <strong>ORGANIZATIONAL  CHART</strong></p>

				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Advertising, promotion and public relations</strong> </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Aims  to create product awareness, influence farmers' buying decisions, (PR)           and  build up a positive perception of the company </p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Sales order administration</strong><strong> and dispatch</strong></li>
			    </ul>

			    </ul>
				<p>Involves  managing the inventory for each class of seed, crop and variety, to           ensure maintenance of germination and  vigour </p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Distribution and transport</strong></li>
			    </ul>

				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Management information</strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Involves  collating and interpreting sales information  and other information as       a  basis for monitoring operations and planning future activities </p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Customer care</strong></li>

                    <a name="The_promotional_campaign" id="The_promotional_campaign"><strong>THE  PROMOTIONAL </strong></a> <strong>ACTIVITIES</strong><br />
				  Resources invested in variety  development and seed production will be wasted if farmers are not persuaded to  use the improved varieties. All promotional activities involve sending messages  to the distributors and consumers in order to inform them about a company's  products and help them to make their decision to buy a particular variety or  brand of seed. </p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Advertisements</strong> </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Messages  sent via the media to inform and influence the farmer </p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Sales  promotions </strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Specific  techniques designed to increase sales of particular seeds </p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Personal  selling </strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p>The  importance of salesmanship </p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Publicity  and public relations</strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Generalized  communication which is designed to promote the company's image rather than that  of specific seeds </p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Extension </strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Farmers  in developing countries have certain characteristics:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>They  have low purchasing power coupled with a low rate of return from farming.</li>
				  <li>They  are generally conservative and therefore are slow to adopt new products.</li>
				  <li>They  may not be well informed.</li>
				  <li>They  often lack mobility and the means to transport goods.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>          It should also be recognized that  educational and literacy standards will not always be high in rural  communities. The use of visual material will help to overcome some  communication problems. In all forms of communication, companies should always  try to make the subject of seeds interesting and relevant to the consumer.<br />
                    <a name="Advertising" id="Advertising"><strong>Advertising</strong></a> <br />
                    <strong>The published print media</strong> <br />
				  This  includes newspapers, periodicals, magazines, trade and professional journals.  There may be both advantages and disadvantages when advertising in this manner.<br />
  <strong>Some  advantages of the printed media are that:</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>good  coverage can be obtained and, by using the local press and specialist  </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>papers,  accurate targeting can also be achieved</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>it  is relatively cheap and immediate</li>
				  <li>complex  messages can be given in print; these can be read again  and again</li>
				  <li>reply  and cut-out coupons with an exchange value can be used to encourage <strong></strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p>farmers  to request further information and buy the product.<strong></strong></p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Some  disadvantages of the printed media are:</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>the  text, and therefore the message, may not be well understood due to language and  literacy problems<strong></strong></li>
				  <li>only  limited space may be available<strong></strong></li>
				  <li>printed  text has limited impact and colour does not always reproduce well in newspapers<strong></strong></li>
				  <li>a  daily paper has a limited life and the advertisements will have to compete for  attention with stories and other information.<strong></strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p>          As well as placing advertisements,  press releases can be given to newspapers or features written that carry the  name of the company and its products.<br />
                    <strong>The broadcast media: </strong>This  includes television, radio and cinema.<br />
                    <strong>Television</strong> <br />
				  Some advantages of television are:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li> the impact will be greater as both sound,  colour and movement can be used</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>     to  convey the message</p>
				<ul>
				  <ul>
				    <li> massive coverage can be achieved and some  local targeting may be possible.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </ul>
				<p>Some disadvantages of television are:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>it  can be very expensive and is only suitable for simple messages</li>
				  <li>the  exposure time is short and the advertisement may miss the target audience</li>
				  <li>TV  reception may be poor and if local targeting is not possible the message will  not be relevant to many viewers</li>
				  <li>there  may not be any related interest programmes that will be viewed by the target  audience</li>
				  <li>in  many countries farmers cannot afford television, although televisions are often  available in clubs, bars and other public places.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Radio</strong><br />
				  Some advantages of radio are:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>good  coverage is achieved; this is not confined to the home as people listen to the  radio everywhere, including when they are working on the farm</li>
				  <li>it  is relatively cheap to broadcast on radio compared to television and  advertisements are easier to prepare</li>
				  <li>the  incidence of local broadcasting, in local languages, is greater than with  television</li>
				  <li>related  interest programmes and farming information spots are usually more frequent.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Some disadvantages of  radio are:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>reception  may be poor in certain areas</li>
				  <li>people  don't always listen closely and consequently may have poor recall of the  message.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>          Language problems can be overcome  through local broadcasting and there is always the possibility of involving  local personalities to add interest and relevance to the area. Radio is useful  for making announcements, such as the availability of seed in the area. Another  form of broadcasting is the loudspeaker van which can be used to tour villages  or towns to make similar announcements, particularly on a market day.<br />
                    <strong>Cinema</strong><br />
				  In rural locations where cinema is the  main entertainment a high proportion of the audience will be involved in  farming so this medium could be considered for advertising. Advertising slides  are not expensive to prepare and these can be shown during the show.<br />
  <strong>The outdoor media</strong><br />
  <strong>          </strong>Outdoor  media include posters, signs and advertising on transport, bus shelters, walls  and buildings. These forms of advertising can be used to increase the  visibility of the company and its products. Outdoor advertising may have  considerable and lasting impact at a low cost if it is well situated and if  there is not too much competition for the available space. Exclusive  arrangements can always be made for the use of space.<strong> </strong><br />
				  In  addition to commercial advertising, retailers should be supplied with signs and  crop boards. It is important that good sites are chosen which are highly  visible and strategically placed to ensure maximum exposure.<br />
  <strong>Packaging design</strong><br />
  <img width="630" height="236" src="lec31_clip_image003.gif" /><strong>          </strong>Packaging  is a form of advertising. Clear printing, the use of colour, brand or company  logo and well reproduced photographs or images are all important components of  design.</p>
