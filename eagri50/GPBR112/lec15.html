				<p>Sunflower is a common oilseed of  India with wider utility. It is used as a source of edible oil, and as raw  material for agri -based industry. Botanically it is known as <em>Helianthus annus</em><strong> </strong>and belongs to the family  asteraceae. It is a cross pollinated crop, insects (honey bees) are the  pollinating agents. The crop has got two types of flowers viz. ray and disc  florets. Seeds set in disc florets which are bisexual but exhibit self  incompatibility due to protoandrous nature of the flower.<strong> </strong><br />
                  <strong>Botany of flower</strong> <br />
          Inflorescence  is a head, consisting of pistillate or sterile ray florets at the periphery and  central hermaphrodite, disc florets. The involucre is bract. The pappus is  calyx or calyx is modified into two papus scales. The five petals are united to  form corolla tube.  Stamens are free and  attached to the base of corolla.  Five  anthers unite to farm anther tube and style is inside the anther tube and  stigma bilobed.  <br />
<strong>Anthesis and pollination</strong><br />
          The  disc florets are protandrous.  Flower  opening starts from outer whorl and proceeds towards centre of head.  The head bloom within 5-10 days.  The pollen grains are viable for 12  hours.  Anthesis take place at 5-8  a.m.  Self incompatibility operates  leading to cross pollination. <br />

				<p><strong>Varietal  seed production technique</strong><br />
          Open  pollination under isolation is the common method of varietal seed production.<br />
<strong>Varieties</strong><br />
          CO  1, CO 2, Morden, K1, K 2, EC 68414, EC 68415<br />
<strong>Stages of  seed multiplication</strong><br />
          In  sunflower seed is multiplied  adopting  three generation system, as breeder seed ,foundation seed and certified seed as  the crop is often cross pollinated crop   where the chances for genetic contamination is high.<br />
<strong>Varietal renovation method  (Pustovit model)</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>In  open pollinated variety, selection of superior plants are made based on the  quality characters viz., plant yield, 100 seed weight and oil content.</li>
				  <li>The  selected plants are harvested separately</li>
				  <li>Then  they are raised in rows individually</li>
				  <li>Seeds  from promising plants are collected and this form the super-elite seeds</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Causes for ill filled seed</strong><br />
                    <strong>a) Pollination</strong>  <br />
				  It is a cross pollinated crop, normally the insect  activity is less.  For increasing the  insect activity bee hives should be kept in the seed production plot in  adequate quantities.  The insect activity  depends on the pollution and insecticides application.  If insect activity is less that leads to poor  seed setting and formation of ill filled seeds.<br />
  <strong>b)  Development of axillary flowers</strong><br />
				  Normally  the axillary flowering takes place during the summer because of the high  intensity of light.  So these type of  axillary buds receive the nutrients and assimilate   whereas the main head does not get the  required quantity of assimilates for seed set there by ill fillings occurs.</p>
				<p><strong>d)  Self incompatibility</strong><br />
				  Presence  of self incompatibility in sunflower also leads to poor seed set and ill filled  seeds.<br />
  <strong>Technology for increased  seed set </strong> </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Pollination  behavior: Sunflower is a cross-pollinated crop. Two types of flowers are available.  They are ray and disc flowers. Ray flowers are unisexual while disc flowers are  bisexual.</li>
				  <li>Pollinating  agent : Honey bees</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Popular  varieties</strong><br />
				  In  Tamil Nadu, Morden, COI,CO2,CO3, K1, K2 , CO4 are the popular varieties for  commercial purpose . <br />
  <strong>Season</strong>       <br />
				  April to May is highly suitable for  irrigated seed crop. The flowering should not coincide either with rain or high  RH as it will wash out the pollen and the maturation should coincide with dry  weather.<br />
  <strong>Land  requirement</strong><br />
				  The  land should be fertile and problem soils will lead to low pollen fertility and  will adversely affect the quality and the seed set will be poor. The previous  crop should not be the same crop to avoid the occurrence of volunteer plants  and if to be the same crop it has to be the same variety and should be  certified and has to be accepted for certification.   The field should not have any volunteer  plants.<br />
  <strong>Field  Standards (Isolation)</strong> <br />
				  General:  1. Sunflower field should be isolated from contaminants as follows</p>
				<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
                  <tr>
                    <td rowspan="2" valign="top"><br />

                  </tr>
                </table>
				<p>          In  sunflower differential blooming dates for modifying the isolation distance is  not permitted   <br />
                    <strong>Seed and  sowing</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>For production of foundation seed,  breeder seed is used as the base material ,while for  certified seed, foundation seed should be  used  as the base material </li>
				  <li>The seed used should be from  authenticated source with tag and bill. </li>
				  <li>The required seed rate will be  8-10kg /ha or 3-4kg/ acre. (Morden 80kg/ha) </li>
				  <li>The seeds are sown at a spacing of  30 x10 cm for the variety morden and at a spacing of 60x20 cm for other  varieties and are dibbled at a depth of 2-4cm.</li>
				  <li>In the main field seeds are sown  either in ridges and furrows or under beds and channels.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p> <strong>Presowing  seed treatment </strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The seeds are given with any one of  the seed treatment or in combination</li>
				  <li>Fresh seeds of sunflower  exhibit   physiological dormancy which  could be broken by soaking the seeds in 300ppm ethrel for 8h or 0.5% KNO3  for 16h. Moist hydration of seed with water for 24h followed by dry dressing  with thiram @2g kg-1 of seed improved the productivity of the seed. </li>
				  <li>Seeds are soaked in 2%  ZnSO4  for 12h with a seed to solution ratio  of 1:0.06   and are dried back to their original moisture content of 8-9% .This  management could be used both for dryland agriculture as well as gardenland. </li>
				  <li>As an ecofriendly   treatrment seeds are also fortified or  hardened with 1% moringa   leaf extract  for 16h with a seed to solution ratio of 1:0.06 and are dried back to their  original moisture content of 8-9%.</li>
				  <li>Seeds are dry dressed with bavistin  @2g/kg of seed to protect against seed borne pathogens and soil borne pathogen.  Seeds are also treated with azospirillum @50g/kg of seed to fix atmospheric  N.  </li>
				  <li>Any one of these treatment or  combination of treatment is adopted for better productivity. On adoption of  sequence of treatment physiological should be followed with physical seed treatment.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Nutrient  application</strong><br />
				  At  last ploughing apply 12.5 tonnes of compost per hectare. The fertilizer  requirement of seed crop is 80:40:40 kg of NPK, in which 40kg of N and full  dose of P and K is applied as basal, while 40kg of N is applied at the time of  earthing up i.e. 40-45 days after crop growth..The seed crop is also sprayed  with 2% DAP or 20ppm NAA at 30and 60 days after sowing. In case of deficient  soils the crop is sprayed with 0.5% Borax at button formation stage.<strong> </strong><br />
  <strong> Micronutrients deficiency</strong><br />
				  Zn  and Fe composition is very important for the proper seed set in sunflower Zn is  responsible for the production of IAA.   Fe deficiency leads to sterility of the pollen.<br />
  <strong>Weeding </strong><br />
  <strong>          </strong>Apply of fluchloralin@ 2l/ha as  pre-emergence herbicide to control the growth of weeds up to 20-25 days. One  hand weeding is done at the time of button stage to keep the field free of  weeds. Weeding after head formation stage is not economical. On organic  production, 2 hand weeding at seedling stage and other at boot leaf formation  will keep the field weed free.<br />
  <strong>Supplementary pollination</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Due to lack of honey bees, seed setting will be  poor. Hence critical or additional pollination is given to the crop for  effective seed setting by</li>
				  <li>Rubbing the heads of two neighbouring plants with  each other.</li>
				  <li>It is done during mid flowering stage (i.e 58-60  days of planting for long duration varieties and 45-48 days for short duration  varieties) at alternate days between 7-11 a.m for 2 weeks.</li>
				  <li>Hand pollination: The heads are rubbed with palm or  muslin cloth so that pollination can be enahnced.</li>
				  <li>In hybrids, the palm is first gently rubbed on the  male parent flowers and then on the female line to transfer the pollen.</li>
			    </ul>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Keeping of bee hives 5 ha-1 </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Foliar application</strong><br />
				  At  head opening stage 2 % D.A.P and 20 ppm N.A.A. sprayed 2 times on 30th  and 60th day after sowing for effective seed setting.<br />
  <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
				  The crop should be irrigated once in a week  for enhanced seed set and formation of bolder grains. The critical stages of  irrigation are primordial initiation stage, vegetative stage, milky and  maturation stage. If the irrigation is withheld in these stages seed set will  be poor and seed size will be reduced.<br />

				<p><strong>Seed  Certification</strong> <br />
                    <strong>Number of  Inspections</strong><br />
                    <strong>          </strong> A minimum of three inspections shall be made  as follows:<br />
				  1. The first inspection shall be  made before flowering on order to verify isolation, volunteer plants, and other  relevant factors,<br />
				  2. The second inspection shall be  made during flowering to check isolation, offtypes and other relevant factors<br />
				  3. The third inspection shall be  made at maturity and prior to harvesting to verify true nature of plant and  other relevant factors<br />
  <strong>Bird scaring</strong><br />
				  At  the time of maturation birds will create problem due to their feeding habit.  Hence, from the time of milky stage of the seed proper protection should be  given against birds as it will lead to reduction in seed yield upto 80 per  cent. <br />
  <strong>Harvesting</strong><br />
				  Change of thalamus colour from green  to yellow is the visual symptom of physiological maturation. Heads are  harvested as once over harvest. </p>

				<p><strong>Threshing</strong><br />
				  The  earheads are dried under sun and threshed with fliable stick for extraction of  seeds The moisture content of seed at the time of threshing will be 15-18%.On  large scale production sunflower   threshers are used, but care should be given to avoid mechanical damage,  which in turn will reduce the seed quality and storability.</p>
				<p><strong>Drying</strong><br />
          The  seeds are dried to 8=10 % moisture content either under sun or adopting  mechanical driers for long term storage as the seeds is orthodox in nature. <br />
<strong>Processing </strong><br />
Mechanical grading can be done with  cleaner cum grader, which will remove the undersized immature and chaffy seeds  .The middle screen size should be 9/64” round perforated sieves. The size can  vary depending on the type of seed. In sunflower the graded seeds also can be  upgraded through specific gravity separator for improvement in seed quality  characters. Even the quality of seed lots having 5-10% lesser germination than  MSCS level can be upgraded through simple specific gravity separation <br />
<strong>Seed  treatment</strong><br />
          The  seeds are infested with several storage pests, to protect against these pests  the seeds are given protective treatment with bavistin @2g/kg of seed.<br />
<strong>Seed packing </strong><br />
          Seeds  are packed in gunny bag for short term storage while in HDPE and polylined  gunny bag for long term storage.<br />
<strong>Storage</strong><br />
          The  treated seed can be stored up to 10 months provided the seeds are not infected  with storage pests. Seed can be stored up to 2 years if the seeds are packed in  moisture containers and are stored at low temperature .The godown should be  kept clean as the possibility of secondary infestation with <em>Trifolium </em>(red flour weevil ) is much in  these crop.<br />
<strong>Seed  standard</strong><br />
          The  processed seed should have the following seed quality characters both for  certification and labeling. <br />
