				<p>Introduction<br />
				  The seed is an important agricultural input and it  plays vital role in increasing production and productivity. There is a need to  safeguard the farmers with the supply of genetically pure and quality seeds.  Any new variety produced by the Scientist has to be multiplied many times to  meet the needs of the farmers. In order  to ensure the availability of quality seeds, Government of India have enacted  Seeds act, 1966 and Seed rules, 1968. The seed (Control) order, 1983 was promulgated  under essential commodities act, 1955 in order to ensure the production,  marketing and equal distribution of the seeds.<br />
  <strong>Seeds Act,  1966</strong><br />
				  The object of Seed Act is to regulate the quality  of certain notified kind / varieties of seeds for sale and for matters  connected therewith. The seed act passed by the Indian Parliament in 1966 was  designed to create a 'Climate' in which the seeds man could operate effectively  and to make good quality seed available to cultivators. Seeds rule under the  act were notified in September 1968 and the act was implemented entirely in  October, 1969. This act extent to the whole of India and it has 25 sections.<br />
				  Seed legislation  could broadly be divided into two groups<br />
  <strong>1.  Sanctioning legislation</strong><br />
				  Sanctioning legislation authorizes formation of Advisory bodies, Seed  Certification Agencies, Seed Testing laboratories, Foundation and Certified  Seed Programmes, Recognition of Seed certification Agencies of Foreign  countries Appellate authorities etc.<br />
  <strong>2.  Regulatory legislation</strong><br />
				  Regulatory Legislation controls the quality of seeds sold in the market  including suitable agencies for regulating the seed quality. On quality control  basis, the Seeds Act could conveniently be divided into the following:</p>
				<p><strong>I. Minimum  limit and labeling of the notified kind / varieties of seed</strong><br />
				  a. Power to  notify the kind / variety<br />
				  b. Labeling  provisions<br />
				  c. Seed testing<br />
				  d. Seed analyst<br />
				  e. Seed  inspectors<br />
				  f. Penalty<br />
				  g. General provisions<br />
  <strong>II. Seed  Certification</strong><br />
  <strong>III.  Restriction of Import and Export of Seeds</strong><br />
  <strong>I. Minimum  limits and labeling</strong><br />
				  Quality control as envisaged in the Act is to be achieved through pre  and post marketing control, voluntary certification and compulsory labeling of  the seeds of notified kind / varieties.<br />
  <strong>(a) Power  to notify the kind / varieties</strong><br />
				  New varieties evolved by the State Agricultural Universities and ICAR  institutes are notified and released /notified respectively under section 5 of  the seeds act in consultation with the central seed committee and its sub  committees constitute under section 3 and 3(5) of the Seeds Act. As on date  more than 2500 varieties and 130 varieties were notified and denotified under  this section. List of varieties notified and denotified from 1969 to 2005 are  compiled and made available in the form of a book called catalogue of varieties  notified and denotified under section 5 of the Seeds Act.   Functions of the Central Seed Committee and  its sub-committee are defined in Clauses 3 and 4 of part II of seed rule.<br />
  <strong>(b) Labeling  provision</strong><br />
				  Minimum limits for germination, physical purity and genetic purity of  varieties / hybrids for crops have been prescribed and notified for labeling  seeds of notified kind / varieties under section 6(a) of the Seeds Act.  Size of the label, colour of the label and  content of the label were also notified under sub clause (b) of Section 6 of  Seeds Act. Colour of the label is opel green and size of the label is 10 cm x  15 cm or proportionate thereof. Responsibility for making labeling content of  mark or label, manner of marking, false / misleading statement on label etc.,  are defined under clause 7,8,9,10,11 and 12 of part V of seeds rule.<br />
  <strong>Section 7 </strong>of the act regulates the sale of notified kind or  varieties. Accordingly no person shall keep for sale, offer to sell, barter or  otherwise supply any seed of any notified kind or variety, after the dates  recorded on the container mark or label as the date unto which the seed may  expected to retain the germination not less than prescribed under clause (a) of  section 6 of the Act.<br />
  <strong>(c) Seed Testing</strong><br />
				  There is a provision to set up a central seed laboratory and state seed  laboratory to discharge functions under section 4(1) and 4(2) of the Seed Act,  In the year 1968 there were 23 state seed testing laboratories in the country.  At present there are 86 Seed testing laboratories functioning in the country.  During 1995-96 these laboratories tested about 5 lakh samples. Seed testing  laboratories have been assigned certain important functions under part III (5)  of Seed Rule.<br />
				  (d) Seed  Analysts<br />
				  State Government could appoint the Seed Analysts through notification in  the Official Gazette under Section 12 of the Seed Act defining his area and his  jurisdiction. Seed Analyst should posses certain minimum qualification as  prescribed under clause 20 part IX of Seed Rule.</p>
				<h2>(e)Seed  Inspectors</h2>
				<p><strong>Classes of  seed</strong><br />
				  The State Government, under section 13 of the Act may appoint such a  person as it thinks fit, having prescribed qualification (Clause 22 part IX of  Seed Rule) through notification, as a Seed Inspector and define the areas within  which he shall exercise jurisdiction for enforcing the seed law. He will be  treated as a public servant within a meaning of section 21 of the I.P.C. (45 of  1860). He has power to examine records, register document of the seed dealer.  He will also exercise such other powers as may be necessary for carrying out  the purposes of this Act or rule made there under. Duties of Seed inspectors  are defined in clause 23 of part IX of Seed rule. He can issue, stop sale order  in case the seed in question contravenes the provision of relevant Act and  rules for which he can use form No.III. When he seizes any record, register  documents or any other material , he should inform a magistrate and take his  order for which he can use form No.IV.</p>
				<h4>(f)Penalty</h4>
				<p>If any person, contravenes any provision of the Act  or Rule, or prevents a seed inspector from taking sample under this Act or  prevents a Seed Inspector from exercising any other power conferred on him  could be punished under section 19 of the act with a fine of five hundred  rupees for the first offence. In the event of such person having been previously  convicted of an offence under this section with imprisonment for a term, may  extend to six months or with fine, which may extent to one thousand rupees or  with both.<br />
                    <strong>II. Seed  certification</strong><br />
				  The object of the Seed Certification is to maintain and make available  to the public through certification high quality propagating material of  notified kind / varieties so grown and distributed as to ensure genetic  identity and genetic purity. The certified standards in force are Indian  Minimum seed certification standards and seed certification procedures form  together for the seed certification regulations. Seeds of only those varieties  which are notified under section under Section 5 of the seeds act shall be  eligible for certification.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Breeder  seed</li>
				  <li>Foundation  seed</li>
				  <li>Certified  Seed</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Breeder  seed</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li> Breeder seed  is a seed directly controlled by the breeder.</li>
				  <li> Breeder seed  should be genetically so pure as to   guarantee that in the subsequent generation.</li>
				  <li>Breeder seed could not come under the perview of  seed certification as it is not meant for public sale.</li>
				  <li>Breeder seed should be packed and supplied with  breeder's golden yellow stag as per the guideline given in Indian Minimum Seed  Certification standards. It is also the fact that no standard for breeder seed  have been prescribed.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Foundation  seed</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Foundation class of seed and certified class of  seed are to be certified by the Certification Agencies as per the Indian  Minimum Seed Certification Standards.</li>
				  <li>Section 8 of the Seeds Act provide state government  or the Central Government consultation with State Government may be  notification in official gazette, established certification agencies for the  state to carry out the functions entrusted to certification agency by or under  this Act (Part IV, clause 6, part VI clause 14 of Seeds Rule).</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Certified  seed</strong></p>
				
				<ul>
				  <li>Seed act section 9 provides any person desires of  producing certified seed shall register his name with concerned seed  certification agency duly remitting the prescribed fee in form No.1 for grant  of certificate. Certificate could be granted in form No.11 after meeting the  requirement of certification agency prescribed under Part VII clause 15,16 and  17 of Seed rule.</li>
				  <li>It should have the minimum genetical purity of 99%</li>
				  <li>Certified seed may be the progeny of certified seed  , provided this reproduction does not exceed two generations beyond foundation  seed and provided that if certification agency determines the genetic and  physical purity, if not be significantly altered</li>
				  <li>In case of highly self pollinated crops  certification of one further generation may be permitted</li>
				  <li>Certified seed produced from certified seed ,shall  be eligible for further seed increase under certification, except in case of  highly self pollinated crops, where certification of one further generation may  be permitted</li>
				  <li>Certification tags issued once for certified seed  not eligible for further seed increase under certification</li>
				  <li>For paddy and wheat, certified seed produced from  certified seed is eligible for certification by NSC up to two generations from  foundation seed</li>

                <p><strong> </strong><br />
                    <strong>New seed policy {1988}</strong><br />
                  The Government of India evolved a New seed policy  implemented<strong> from October 1, 1988.</strong><br />
  <strong>The policy laid special emphasis on</strong><br />
                  - Import of high quality of seeds<br />
                  - A time bound programme to modernize plant  quarantine facilities<br />
                  - Effective implementation of procedures for  quarantine /post entry quarantine and<br />
                  - Incentives to encourage the domestic industry<br />
                  - Import of quality seeds.</p>
                <ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Bulk import of seeds of coarse cereals, pulses       and oil seeds may replace (or) displace the local productions.</li>
                  <li>Transfer of technology may not be actual one,       because due to bulk import of seeds or import of technology, instead we       can import the germplasm of superior variety if any and could be developed       locally to meet the demand (i.e.,) incorporate the advantages of exotic       variety to the local types(or) even direct multiplication's after adaptive       trials.</li>
                  <li>As we have superior varieties of international       standard (e.g.) Maize, Sorghum, Bajra, or even in oil seeds like groundnut       etc., the bulk import is not necessiated. Instead we need varieties       suitable to agroclimatic zones besides higher yields.</li>
                  <li>Import of flower seeds could be encouraged in       order to earn foreign exchange through export of flowers and it can be       imported under (OGL) open general license. But there is a fear of       introduction of new pest and diseases as they are coming without post       entry quarantine checkup.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Strengthening of quarantine<br />
                  Since, 1st October 1988 only bulk import of seeds  was under taken without any progress either in the strengthening of quarantine  facilities.<br />
                  Threat of pest and disease<br />
                  Introduction of new pest and disease would pose a  new problem due to bulk import due to lack of post entry quarantine. To avoid  this threat, the imported seeds should be subjected to testing and it should be  done by one person from ICAR. Entry of exotic variety without proper field  testing may change the disease pattern if that particular strain is becoming  susceptible to existing pathogens.<br />
  <strong>(e.g.) </strong>Kernal burnt - which was not noticed in the  previous years is now a major disease on wheat after the introduction of  Kalyansona.<br />
                  Genetic erosion<br />
                  It is another danger, due to introduction of  similar strains there is a danger of genetic uniformity and eliminates local  diversified strains which leads to problem of non-availability of improved  strains if there is any outbreak of disease.<br />
                  Incentives to domestic seed  industry<br />
                  Indigenous seed production / seed industry will be affected because of  the entry of multi nation diseases. Since the policy is allowing indiscriminate  bulk imports through private sectors at the same time the import duty on seeds  has been reduced to 15 per cent. Import duty on advanced machines and equipment  used in seed production or processing has also been reduced and interest on  post shipment credit has also been slashed down to help importers. Income tax  rebate and deduction are available to the taxpaying units on the revenue  expenditure or in house research and development. Incentives are also being  provided to seeds located in backward areas and growth centers.<br />
                  Application of biotechnology  in agriculture<br />
                  The multination would prevent the III world  countries in enjoying the full benefit of biotechnology. The bulk import of  seed indicates accepting the monopoly rights and the limitation of potential  bio-technology in agriculture.<br />
                  Advantages of biotechnology  in agriculture<br />
                  Certain plants fertilize themselves through nitrogen fixation, which is  one of the most promising areas of genetic engineering. Bacterium on the roots  of plants like groundnut, and soyabean take nitrogen from the air and transform  it into nitrates. Scientists are studying the possibility of transforming the  genes responsible for nitrogen fixation in wheat, rice, and maize (in which  nitrogen fixation doses not occur). They feel new strains can be grown without  expensive chemical fertilizers.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Plant variety protection (PVP) and the Indian  agriculture (Protection of Plant Variety &amp; farmers right Bill,2001)</strong><br />
                  The Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) are  generally being applicable to industrial property only. The patent laws of  India did not provide for IPRs on living organisms including plant varieties.  The question of plant variety protection has been brought in to sharp focus by  Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)  which is a part of Agreement establishing World Trade Organization (WTO). India  is a signatory to TRIPS agreement, which casts an obligation on member  countries to provide for a system of plant variety protection either through  patents or through a <em>sui generis </em>legislation framework or a combination  thereof. Under these agreements, a legislative framework for plant variety  protection has to be provided by member countries within a specified time  period. While this has lent some urgency to the question of plant variety  protection, the question of plant variety rights, even independent of the  obligations posed by TRIP’s agreement, has been under active consideration in  view of our strong agricultural research system. The plant breeding programmes  have become more sophisticated and high input based. The extent of investment  by the State on public research, in evolving varieties of commercial  significance, is coming down with  responsibility of evolving new varieties of crops of commercial significance  being left to the private sector commercial organisations. There is also a move  on the part of the international research institutions, who at one time played  a pioneering role in plant breeding and genetic work, to focus on pure or  strategic research. In the wake of the global economic liberalization, it is  only expected that agriculture is accorded the status of an industry and given  all incentives and impetus, normally required for a fast developing,  competitive business. To meet our food demands, as well as to exploit our  export potential in agricultural commodities, development and use of new plant  varieties having specific agronomic nutritive or market preference  characteristics are essential. New varieties may be bred for higher yields,  greater resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, longer shelf life, better  consumer preference, higher industrial value, low input requirements and so on.  To meet these demands the variety improvement activities based on conventional  as well as biotechnological methods requires heavy investments both in  scientific, man power and economic terms. It is therefore, understandable that the  fruits of such intensive efforts will have to be protected from misuse, and  also ensuring an appropriate incentive (reward) to the breeder.<br />
  <strong>The  following are the plant variety protection steps:</strong><br />
  <strong>1.  Historical developments of plant variety protection</strong><br />
                  For over 60 years, different forms of protection of  new plant varieties through the system of Plant Breeders' Right (PBR’s) have  been in existence in industralised countries which essentially means that the  holder of the PBR can prevent others from producing propagating material of the  protected variety and / or marketing the same. In order to coordinate inter  country implementation of PBR a &quot; Union Internationale Pour La Protection  Des Obtention Vegetables&quot; (UPOV) was established by International Convention for Protection of  New Varieties of plants (the UPOV convention), which was signed in Paris in  1961. The convention entered into force in 1968. It was revised in 1972,  1978 and 1991. The 1978 Act entered into force in 1981. The 1991 act has not  yet entered into force.<br />
                  The purpose of UPOV convention is to ensure that  the member States of the Union acknowledge the achievements of breeder of new  plant varieties by making available to them exclusive property rights, on the  basis of a set of uniform and clearly defined principles. To be eligible for  protection, varieties have to be (I) distinct from existing known varieties  (ii) sufficiently homogenous (uniform) (iii) stable and (iv) new in the sense  that they must not have commercialised prior to certain dates established by  reference to the date of the application for protection.<br />
  <strong>2. Scope of  protection of plant varieties under UPOV convention</strong><br />
                  Both the 1978 and 1991 conventions set out a  minimum scope of protection offer to member states for the possibility of  taking national circumstances into account in their legislation. Under 1978  Act, the minimum scope of the Plant Breeders' right requires that the holders'  authorization for the production for purposes of commercial marketing, the  offering for sale and marketing of propagating material of protected variety.<br />
                  The 1991 Act contains more detailed provision  defining the acts concerning propagating material in relation to which holders'  authorization is required. Exceptionally, but only where the holder has no  reasonable opportunity to exercise his right in relation to the propagating  material, his authorization may be required in relation to any specified acts  done with harvested material of the variety.<br />
  <strong>3. Duration  of plant breeder's rights</strong><br />
                  Like all intellectual property rights, plant  breeder’s rights are granted for a limited period of time (15-20 years) at the  end of which varieties protected by them pass into public domain. The rights  are also subject to controls, in the public interest, against any possible  abuse.<br />
  <strong>4.  Exemptions</strong><br />
                  It is also important to note that authorization of  the holder of plant breeders' rights is not required for the use of his variety  for research purpose, including its use in the breeding of further new  varieties.<br />
                  From the inception of UPOV in 1961, farmers have  been allowed to use their own harvested material of protected varieties for the  next production cycle on their own farms. On farm saving is still a practice in  UPOV countries. The 1991 UPOV convention contains an &quot;Optional exception&quot;  which provides that it is unto the national government to decide whether to  permit farmers to use the seed of a PBR protected variety for propagation  purposes on their own holdings or not.<br />
  <strong>5.  Sovereign rights on biological resources</strong><br />
                  Another major development, which has taken place  along with India signing the World Trade Agreement, is global Biodiversity  Convention. India is a signatory to this convention, which became operational  on December 29, 1993. Among other things it reaffirms that &quot;the states have  sovereign rights over their own biological resources&quot; and that states are  responsible for conserving their biological diversity and for using their  biological resources in a sustainable manner&quot;.<br />
  <strong>6.  Suggestions for a SUI system of plant variety protection</strong><br />
                  The proposal of 1991 UPOV convention which extents  plant breeders rights to the harvested material, is not appropriate for our  country. The frame work for plant variety protection has to be evolved in a  manner that prevents situations where repeated imports of improved varieties  are not required so as to avoid dependence on foreign sources of supply.<br />
                  While, finalizing legislation on PVP, the  government needs to strike a balance between its commitment under WTO, growth  of the seed sector and their interests of the farmers, which through a  difficult task, is not impossible to achieve.<br />
  <strong>7. Seed  Industry Development in Post PVP period</strong><br />
                  In the post PVP period, we anticipate fairly high  investment in seed research from private sector and healthy competition with  public sector in crop breeding and seed production and distribution. However,  public sector institutions will continue to play major role in developing  varieties of wheat rice, chick pea, pigeon pea, mungbeans, urdbeans, groundnut,  sugarcane, jute, potato and millets. The continued improvement of these crops  is most vital for our food security system. The public sector will have to  continue to develop varieties for rainfed, salt affected, hilly and low lying  flood prone regions. In export potential of food grains and other agricultural  commodities, breeding for quality of produce will have to be given priority. We  may also tailor varieties suited to the needs of the importing countries. Since  there is growing concern about the use of chemical pesticides in crop production,  the present research programme of breeding for resistance against the pests and  diseases will have to be strengthened further. <strong>Strategic research on breeding for research against pests and diseases  will be priority areas of research of a public institution</strong>. We anticipate  that the material generated from these research programmes will be made  available to the private sector.<br />
                  Seed industry both in public and private sector is  likely to develop at a fast rate after the legislation on plant variety protection  is enacted. The recent experience shows that contribution of both public and  private sector in Seed industry development is complimentary. While private  sector seed companies are concentrating on hybrids of millets, oil seeds,  cotton and vegetables, the public sector seed corporations are engaged in seed  production and distribution of self-pollinated crops. It has also been observed  that due to competition among the seed companies, the farmers have been  benefited not only in respect of stability in prices of hybrid seeds but also  better quality of seeds. It is expected that with programmatic policy planning,  faster growth of both public and private sector in seed research and  development will be ensured so that they can play important role in improving  the incomes and standards of living of our farmers.</p>
