				<h1>Demand  Forecasting of seed</h1>
				<p>          In adequate estimation of demand and the consequences of  over production or under production can cause serious financial consequences  for a seed company. Too many carryovers and stock write-offs will prove to be  expensive, while lack of seed means a loss of revenue and a source of  frustration for the sales force and the dealer network. This combination of  special features in the seed industry makes the accurate assessment of demand  even more critical. Some of these features are</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Longer  period of time for the development new products from breeding programmes</li>
				  <li>Seasonality  of production</li>
				  <li>Production  subject to variables like agro climatic conditions outside the control of  management</li>
				  <li>Statutory  controls and quality standards</li>
				  <li>Existence  of a generation system – where by the production in one year is the progenitor  the next</li>
				  <li>Limited  shelf like and loss of germination</li>
				  <li>Seed  replacement rate: Seed Replacement Rate is the rate at which the farmers  replace the seeds instead of using their own seeds</li>
			    </ul>

				  In demand  forecasting the first step is to calculate the existing requirement multiplied  by percent bought seed, which is the amount of commercial seed purchased by  farmers. In calculating seed requirement, seed multiplication rates must be  taken into account.<strong> </strong>Seed Multiplication Ratio is the ratio at which the  seed multiplies.<br />
				  In the  present Indian scenario, seed production can be taken up as a small-scale  industry or it can be taken up as under contract for the other seed companies.  In either way, seed production has huge potential to ensure better returns.<br />
  <strong>Factors  which affect demand </strong><br />
  <strong>          </strong>It is important to distinguish  between actual demand, perceived demand and what the government expects the  farmers to buy. The total amount of certified or labelled seed sold may be  quite a small proportion of the total requirement. <br />
				  Many factors have to be considered while assessing and  forecasting demand. Some of these are:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Cropping  pattern and intensity</li>
				  <li>Type  of seed used</li>
				  <li>Climate</li>
				  <li>Demand  for crop products</li>
				  <li>Market  scenario</li>
				  <li>Disposable  farm income</li>
				  <li>Rate  or level of adoption of new technology</li>
				  <li>Government  policy</li>
				  <li>Crop  cycles</li>
				  <li>Habits  and tradition</li>
				  <li>Product  performance</li>
				  <li>Competitiveness</li>
				  <li>Price </li>
				  <li>Promotion </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>The most  important factors that need to be taken into account when an individual company  or organization is estimating the market share that may be gained by its own  products are product performance, competitive positioning, price and promotion.  This will form the basis of sales forecasting and production planning. <br />
                    <a name="Demand_forecasting_techniques" id="Demand_forecasting_techniques"><strong>Demand forecasting  techniques</strong></a> <br />
				  Forecasting  is the process of making projections of demand for products by examining past  and present performance levels, combined with an assessment of available  products and markets. This may be carried out within the government service or  by individual companies in a purely commercial context. The following  approaches can be used:<br />
  <strong>Target setting:</strong> This method is commonly used in developing countries where government is  directly involved in planning and seed supply. In a centrally managed economy,  targets are likely to be set at a national level and production plans fixed for  each region.<br />
				  India  is an example of a more open economy where both the public and private sectors  coexist in a well-developed seed industry, but where the government retains a  coordinating function and has the ultimate responsibility for the security of  seed supply. The Ministry of Agriculture sets the targets and organizes  meetings to establish the supply situation and production plans of the various  organizations involved.<br />
				  Companies  may opt to set a target for an ideal sales level while, at the same time,  recognizing that this is unlikely to be achieved and budgeting for a more  achievable situation.<br />
  <strong>Growth trends:</strong>This approach is based on the assumption  that the rate of growth of seed demand as seen in past years will continue.  This may give unrealistically high forecasts and will depend on the stage of  market development for improved seeds. Small increases in volume in the early  stages of improved seed use will represent a large increase in percentage  terms, which may not be possible to sustain.<br />
  <strong>Growth rates adjusted for  new technology adoption:</strong> Using this approach a given  region is considered on the basis of degrees of new technology uptake and the  likely speed of change. Each part of the region can then be categorized as  'low' to 'medium' or 'high' growth, better reflecting the overall situation.<br />
  <strong>Sampling:</strong>The accuracy of the above approaches can be  improved if sample groups of farmers are questioned to gauge their anticipated  demand for seed. This exercise is more reliable where there is a reasonable  awareness of the benefits of using improved seeds.<br />
  <strong>SEED PRODUCTION</strong><br />
				  To meet the Nation's food security needs, it is important to make  available to Indian farmers a wide range of seeds of superior quality, in  adequate quantity on a timely basis. Public Sector Seed Institutions will be  encouraged to enhance production of seed towards meeting the objective of food  and nutritional security. <br />
				  The Indian seed programme adheres to the limited three generation  system of seed<br />
				  multiplication, namely, breeder, foundation and certified seed.  Breeder seed is the<br />
				  progeny of nucleus seed. </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Nucleus  seed is the seed produced by the breeder to develop the particular variety and  is directly used for multiplication as breeder seed.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Breeder  seed is the seed material directly controlled by the originating or the sponsoring  breeder or Institution for the initial and recurring production of foundation  seed.</li>
			    </ul>
				<ul>
				  <li>Foundation  seed is the progeny of breeder seed. Foundation seed may also be produced from  foundation seed. Production of foundation seed stage-I and stage-II may thus be  permitted, if supervised and approved by the Certification Agency and if the  production process is so handled as to maintain specific genetic purity and identity.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Certified  seed is the progeny of foundation seed or the progeny of certified seed. If the  certified seed is the progeny of certified seed, then this reproduction will  not exceed three generations beyond foundation stage-I and it will be  ascertained by the Certification Agency that genetic identity and genetic  purity has not been significantly altered. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Public Sector Seed Production Agencies will continue to have free  access to breeder<br />
				  seed under the National Agriculture Research System. The State  Farms Corporation<br />
				  of India and National Seeds Corporation will be restructured to  make productive use<br />
				  of these organisations in the planned growth of the Seed Sector.</p>
				<p>Private Seed Production Agencies will also have access to breeder  seed subject to<br />
				  terms and conditions to be decided by Government of India.</p>
				<p>State  Agriculture Universities/ICAR Institutes will have the primary responsibility  for production of breeder seed as per the requirements of the respective States.<br />
				  <br />
				  Special attention will be given to the need to upgrade the quality  of farmers’ saved<br />
				  seeds through interventions such as the Seed Village Scheme.</p>
				<p>Seed replacement rates will be raised progressively with the  objective of expanding<br />
				  the use of quality seeds.</p>
				<p>DAC, in consultation with ICAR and States, will prepare a National  Seed Map to identify potential, alternative and non-traditional areas for seed  production of specific crops.</p>
				<p>To put in place an effective seed production programme, each State  will undertake<br />
				  advance planning and prepare a perspective plan for seed  production and  distribution over a  rolling (five to six year) period. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_bank">Seed</a> Banks will be set up  in nontraditional areas to meet demands for seeds during natural calamities. </p>
				<p>The <a href="http://seednet.gov.in/material/Guidelines%20and%20Schemes/Guidelines%20for%20seed%20village%20sceme.pdf">'Seed</a> Village Scheme' will be promoted to facilitate production and timely availability  of seed of desired crops/varieties at the local level. Special emphasis will<br />
				  be given to seed multiplication for building adequate stocks of  certified/quality seeds by providing foundation seed to farmers.</p>
				<p>For popularising newly developed varieties and promoting seed  production of these<br />
				  varieties, seed minikits of pioneering seed varieties will be  supplied to farmers. Seed exchange among farmers and seed producers will be  encouraged to popularize new/non-traditional varieties.</p>
				<p>Seeds of newly developed varieties must be made available to  farmers with minimum time gap. Seed producing agencies will be encouraged to  tie up with Research Institutions for popularization and commercialization of  these varieties.</p>
				<p>As hybrids have the potential to improve plant vigour and increase  yield, support for production of hybrid seed will be provided. </p>
				<p>Seed production will be extended to agro -climatic zones which are  outside the traditional seed growing areas, in order to avoid un remunerative  seed farming in<br />
				  unsuitable areas.</p>
				<p>Seed Banks will be established for stocking specified quantities  of seed of required<br />
				  crops/varieties for ensuring timely and adequate supply of seeds  to farmers during<br />
				  adverse situations such as natural calamities, shortfalls in  production, etc. Seed Banks will be suitably strengthened with cold storage and  pest control facilities.</p>
				<p>The storage of seed at the village level will be encouraged to  facilitate immediate availability of seeds in the event of natural calamities  and unforeseen situations. For the storage of seeds at farm level, scientific  storage structures will be popularized and techniques of scientific storage of  seeds will be promoted among farmers as an extension practice.</p>
				<p>Seed growers will be encouraged to avail of Seed Crop Insurance to  cover risk factors involved in production of seeds. The Seed Crop Insurance  Scheme will be reviewed so as to provide effective risk cover to seed producers  and will be extended to all traditional and non-traditional areas covered under  the seed production programme.</p>
				<p><strong>Recommended  System of Breeder Seed Indent and Supply</strong><br />
				  <br />
				  1.Every  State shall provide the agro-climatic zone-wise, district-wise and variety-wise  quantity of certified/quality seeds sold and area covered in the previous  Kharif/Rabi season along with SRR, productivity data to ICAR, DAC and SAUs by <strong><em>1st  December for Kharif crops and 1st May for Rabi crops.</em></strong></p>
				<p>2.  ICAR shall prepare and circulate a list of State/area/agro-climatic zone-specific  recommended varieties/hybrids of seeds particularly the newly released  varieties/hybrids for cultivation along with relevant data regarding their  yield potential, duration etc. to every State on or before <strong><em>1st  January for Kharif crops and 1st June for Rabi Crops </em></strong>with  copy to Seed Division, DAC.</p>
				<p>3.  SAUs shall do a similar exercise in respect of State varieties. </p>
				<p>4.  Each State in consultation with ICAR Institutes, SAUs and Seed producing  Agencies shall formulate seed plan (for Breeder, Foundation and Certified Seed)  for the cropping seasons on the basis of an assessment of existing and new  varieties in terms of actual or potential yield in each district/agro-climatic  zone. </p>
				<p>5.  State Governments shall submit the seed plan and the Breeder Seeds indent to  DAC, ICAR, SAUs. The Breeder Seed Indent shall be submitted to the SAUs  directly for State varieties and submitted to Seeds Division DAC/ICAR for  national varieties by <strong><em>15th January for Kharif crops and  15th June for Rabi crops.</em></strong></p>
				<p>6.  Private seed companies will also place the breeder seed indent by <strong><em>15th  January for Kharif crops and 15th June for Rabi </em></strong>crops  through National Seeds Association of India (NSAI) to Seeds Division, DAC.</p>
				<p>7.  DAC shall compile all the Breeder Seed Indents of States and private seed  companies and furnish them to ICAR/ concerned PDs/PCs for production of the  breeder seeds.<br />
				  8.  The breeder seed will be allotted to all States and private seed companies for  lifting from institutes of ICAR, SAUs to produce foundation and certified seed.</p>
				<p>9.  The Lifting of Breeder Seed is to be monitored every 15 days jointly by DAC and  ICAR.</p>
				<p>10.  To popularise new varieties and to induce confidence among the farmers apart  from Front Line Demonstrations (FLDs), each ICAR centre, SAU and KVK shall  adopt 1-2 villages in a block in an agroclimatic zone of the State for  demonstration in participatory mode in the farmers fields to demonstrate the productivity/potential  of the new variety with an appropriate mix of inputs and practices. State  Government extension staff willfully participates in the finalisation plan of  FLDs-list of farmers training etc.</p>
				<p>11.  In case of hybrids of important food crops such as paddy hybrids the State  Agriculture Universities shall take the responsibility in large scale  production of Pure high quality parental lines (A Lines, R Lines) (Breeder and  foundation seed). It would be ensured that NSC, SFCI, State Seeds Corporations  will procure the foundation seeds on priority.</p>
				<p>12.  SAUs shall provide foundation seed to all State Seed Corporations, State Seed  Farms, NSC, SFCI and Private Seed Companies for taking up large scale hybrid  seed production and make it available to farmers at affordable prices. SAUs may  also take up large-scale hybrid seed production in their Farms.</p>
