				<p>Maintaining the quality of seed is dependent  on many environmental factors, some of which are moisture, temperature,  humirlity, and storage conditions. Even though these factors are properly  accounted for, seed quality may still be reduced by certain seedborne diseases  or destroyed by insects and other pests. Research has shown that treating seed  with one or more pesticides is the most economical and efficient way to protect  seed from these pests and improve seed quality. Since pesticides are poisonous,  extra care and safety precautions must be taken when applying them and in  handling seed after it has been treated.</p>
				<p><strong>Definition</strong> <strong>of treated seed</strong><br />
				  The  term &quot;treated&quot; means &quot;to give an application of a pesticide or  subject seed to a process designed to reduce, control or repel disease  organisms, insects, or other pests which attack the seed or seedlings.”</p>
				<p><strong>Types of Seed Treatment</strong><br />
                    <strong>A. Pre sowing seed treatments</strong><br />
				  It  is the treatments given to the seeds before sowing to improve the germination  and vigour potential and as well as to maintain the health of the seed.<br />
				  Pre sowing seed treatments includes the following<br />
				  I. Chemical treatments to improve germination and  vigour potential.<br />
				  II. Insecticidal and fungicidal treatment.<br />
				  III. Special treatments<br />
  <strong>I. Chemical treatments to  improve germination and vigour potential</strong><br />
				  Soaking / treating the seeds with nutrients vitamins  and micronutrients etc. <br />
  <strong>Paddy: </strong>Seeds can be soaked in 1 % KCl solution for 12  hours to improve the germination and vigour potential.<br />
  <strong>Sorghum:</strong>  Seeds could  be soaked in  NaCl2 (1 %) or  KH2PO4 (1%) for 12 hours for improving the germination  and vigour potential.<br />
  <img width="455" height="310" src="lec29_clip_image002.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="Seed Chart 3 copy" /> </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Pulses : </strong> Seeds can be  soaked in ZnSO4, MgSO4 and MnSO4 100 ppm  solution for 4 hours to improve the germination and vigour potential.<br />
                    <strong>II. Insecticidal and  Fungicidal treatments</strong><br />
                    <strong>Seed health:</strong>   It is an  important attribute of quality seed.   Though a seed lot that meets high standards of germination, vigour and  purity if it is contaminated with seed borne pathogens and insect pests, may be  useless to farmers because it may result in severe yield loss or even crop loss  in an entire area.<br />
				  Benefits of the insecticidal and fungicidal  treatments:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Prevents  the spread of plant diseases</li>
				  <li>It  protects the seed from seed rot and seedling blights.</li>
				  <li>It  improves the seed germination</li>
				  <li>It  provides protection from storage insects.</li>
				  <li>It  controls the soil insects.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>          Seed  may be affected by viruses, bacteria, fungi, nematodes and insects.  Seed pests and diseases of which the seed is  a victim (e.g., grain weevils, Tricoderma spp., and storage pathogens such as  Aspergillus flavus) should be distinguished from seed-borne diseases of which  the seed is the vehicle of pest and pathogen dissemination (e.g., bunt of  cereals, Tilletia spp.)<br />
                    <strong>Seed Treatment Fungicides</strong><br />
				  Fungicides are applied to seed prior  to planting to provide effective protection against many seed and soil-borne  plant pathogens. Chemical (fungicide) treatment guards against the various seed  rots and seedling blights that occur during storage or after planting. It<strong> </strong>is not usually a  &quot;cure-all&quot; and will not provide disease protection throughout the  growing season after the plants become self-sufficient. (An exception to this  would be the control of loose smut by seed disinfection).<br />
				  Fungicidal seed treatment may be  divided into three categories, depending on the nature and purpose of the  treatment. These categories are: (1) seed disinfection, (2) seed  disinfestation, and (3) seed protection. A given fungicide may serve in one or  more of these categories.<br />
  <strong>Seed  disinfection</strong> - Disinfection  is the elimination of a pathogen which has penetrated into living cells of  the seed, infected it and become established-for example, loose smut of barley  and wheat.<br />
				  <strong>Seed  disinfestations</strong> - Disinfestation is the control of  spores and other forms of pathogenic organisms found on the surface of the seed.<br />
				  <strong>Seed  protection </strong>- Seed protection is chemical  treatment to protect the seed and young seedling from pathogenic organisms in  the soil.<br />
				  Seed  treatment materials are usually applied to seed in one of four forms: dust;  slurry (a mixture of wettable powder in water); liquids; and planter-box  formulations.<br />
				  Based  on composition, seed treatment fungicides may be organic or inorganic, metallic  or non-metallic, and, until recently, mercurial or non-mercurial. Before the  cancellation of the 'volatile mercurials, fungicides for treating seed were  generally classified as volatile and non-volatile. Vlith the elimination of the  volatile mercurials, most fungicides now approved for use on seed are  classified as non-volatile. When using this type material, complete coverage of  the seed is necessary to obtain effective control.<br />
				  Some  of the systemics, a fairly new class of pesticides, may now be used as seed  treatment materials. The desirability of having materials that would move  inside the seed or plant and control the pest has long been recognized. Such  materials are called &quot;systemic.&quot; When used according to the  manufacturer's recommendation (see label), a systemic moves through the host  plant and controls or retards the growth of certain fungi and insects without  affecting the host's metabolic system.</p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Seed Treatment Insecticides</strong><br />
				  Insecticides are often applied to seed  to control or reduce insect damage to seed during storage and, to a lesser  degree, to prevent damage from such insects as wireworms and seed corn maggots  in the soil.<br />
  <strong>Combinations</strong><br />
				  Since some pesticides are selective in  their control of pests, many times two or more compounds are combined in the  treater tank, or an extra tank may be used, to give the spectrum of control needed.<br />
				  The manufacturers of pesticides are  now making combinations available to seed processors, but should a processor  blend two or more pesticides, the compatibility of the materials must be determined,  since some combinations of materials may seriously reduce seed germination.  Also, when applying two or more pesticides, even at different times, the  sequence of application may be very important. Whether a single pesticide or a  combination is to be applied to the seed, read the label and follow the  manufacturer's directions carefully.<br />
  <strong>Formulation of fungicides  /insecticides</strong><br />
				  Fungicides  / insecticides are available in the form of dusts, wettable powders and  liquids.</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Dusts  :  It  is usually applied @ 200-250 gms / quintal of seed.  Main dis-advantage is dusty condition will  prevail during the seed treatment and after handling.</li>
				  <li>Slurry  :  This type of fungicide is applied to  the seed along with soap like water suspension which can be mixed with seed by  using special slurry treater.</li>
				  <li>Liquids  : The use of liquid solution is known as the &quot;quick wet ' method. Here a  volatile fungicide is applied to the seed and it throughly mixed with them.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>e.g.   Chemicals like panogen, mercuran, etc. can be applied by this method.</p>
				<h1>Safety</h1>
				<p>          There  is a general tendency to use chemicals that are safe for user and  environment.  Very toxic substances, such  a organic mercurials (Ceresan and others) and very persistant fungicides, such  as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexachlorobenzene">Hexachlorobenzene</a> ((HCB), are being replaced by new chemicals, In the past, these chemicals have  caused severe cases of poisoning, some resulting in death.  Most if not all occurred because treated seed  was used for human consumption or livestock feeding instead of for  planting.  Even with the new, less toxic  chemicals, the following safety precautions must be taken.</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Treated  seed must be clearly labelled and under no circumstances be used for feed or  food.</li>
				  <li>Seed  treatment should be carried out in a well-aerated area.  Contact with chemicals through breathing of  dusts and skin contact must be avoided.   Protective clothing should be worn.</li>
				  <li>As  with all pesticides, empty containers should be properly disposed of and never  reused in a household or on the farm.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>III. Special treatments</strong><br />
                    <strong> i) Seed hardening treatment</strong><br />
				  Seeds  can be hardened for 2 purposes I) Drought tolerance ii) Cold tolerance<br />
				  The  treatments are imposed to the seeds mainly to tolerate initial drought and  cold.  Cold tolerance treatment is given  to germinated seeds, such treatments are given only to temperate crop and tree  seeds.<br />
				  The most important factors to be considered while  seed hardening are</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Seed : solution ratio  (1:1)</li>
				  <li>The duration of soaking </li>
				  <li>Method  of drying.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>          The effectiveness  of the treatment depends upon the conduct of seed hardening process.  The solution amount never be higher than the  amount of the seeds. All solution added should be imbibed by the seeds.  There should not be any leftover solution as  it causes leaching effect. Once the seeds imbibe water, the germination process  takes place.  At the end of soaking  period the seeds should be dried back to its original moisture content. These  seeds when sown the germination will be completed earlier whereas in non  hardened seeds the process germination takes a longer period. <br />
				  Chemicals used :   CaCl2, KCl, KH2PO4, </p>
				<p><strong>ii) Seed fortification</strong><br />
          Main  aim is to supply nutrients to seeds. The main objective is to achieve the high  vigour to overcome unfavourable soil reactions. eg.) seed fortification with  MnSO4 @ 0.5 to 1 %.  will  improve oxidation - reduction potential of seeds, which ultimately leads to  higher germination.  <br />
<strong>iii) Moist sand conditioning</strong><br />
It is a need based treatment the concentration can  be increased upto 2-4 %. Amount of solution should be 1:1 ratio or slightly  excess amount of water can be used. Protinaceous seeds should not  be soaked in water (e.g) soybean, etc. for  these seeds, mix the seeds with moist sand @ 5 to 10% MC.  It should be kept for specified period of  time.  The method is known as moist sand  hydration.<br />
<strong>iv) Seed pelleting</strong><br />
          Here the nutrients are coated on the seeds. This technique  is very much adopted in forest tree seeds.<br />
<strong>Importance</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Normally in small seeds this technique is adopted .</li>
				  <li>By pelleting we can increase the size of sees and  we can make it free flowing one.</li>
				  <li>Through this we can able to reduce the seed rate.</li>
				  <li>It is also important for aerial sowing (gum  arabica) in  tree seeds.</li>
			    </ol>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Materials used : </strong>Nutrients , adhesive, filler material.<br />
                    <strong>Inert materials: </strong>Lime, CaCO3, Chalk powder.<br />
                    <strong>Plant products : </strong>Neem, Notchi, Arappu, Arappu (Albizia amara) is  found good contains a susbstance saponin (growth promoter) which is similar to  GA in action.<br />
                    <strong>v) Seed infusion</strong><br />
				  Infusion  of nutrients and growth promoting substances with organic solvents like acetone  and dichlormethane.<br />
				  The  organic solvents, slowly increase the chemicals in to the seed. In this method  there is no need for drying the seed materials to bring back the original  moisture content of seed.  The organic  chemicals are evaporative in nature, after infusion is over, just we have to  keep the seeds as such for 5 to 10 minutes in dry condition the organic  solvents will evaporate during this time and we can perform sowing.  Seed infusion can also be used for breaking  the seed dormancy.</p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>vi) Osmotic <a href="http://www.gaia-movement.org/files/Booklet%2029%20Priming.pdf">priming</a></strong><br />
				  It  is a very expensive but it is a required process, particularly for large seeded  legumes like peas, beans etc., They have high protein content and large embryo  and are susceptible to soaking injury. High protein seeds are hygroscrpic and  hydrophilic.<br />
				  Osmotic  priming is nothing but making the seeds to imbibe water very slowly.  Osmotic solutions used are (PEG) (poly  ethylene glyster).  Maintol is highly  toxic.  PEG is inert and will increase  very slowly the water in to seeds. By preconditioning through osmotic priming,  the seeds are invigourated which results in uniform, early and higher field  emergence and higher seedling vigour.<br />
  <strong>vii) Fluid drilling</strong><br />
				  This  is a technology evolved for mechanical sowing of seeds particularly the  germinated seeds.  The seeds are coated  with a jelly material called guar gel.   It is to have a buffer action to avoid damage of the germinated seeds  during sowing.<br />
  <strong>viii)  Separation of viable seeds</strong><br />
				  It  is a new concept particularly for groundnut.   This is a good method to get desired seed germination and plant  population.  Incase of groundnut the  actual population requirement is 30 plants / m2.  Actual seed multiplication rate in groundnut  is 1:8 .  There are about 30-40% of dead  seeds and of such dead seeds are eliminated, and then we will be able to  maintain the required plant population in the field.  This is the base for evolving this  technology.<br />
				  This can be done in 2 ways<br />
				  1. Manual separation based on radicle emergence  (groundnut)<br />
				  2. IDS (Incubation   - Drying and Separation) method.</p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>B. Pre storage treatments</strong><br />
				  Prestorage  treatments of harvest-fresh seed are primarily aimed towards protection against  deteriorate senescence during storage. Seed storage which is again threatened  by insect and pathogen attack, can also be taken care of by prescribed  prestorage seed treatments.</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Halogenation</li>
				  <li>Antioxidant  treatment</li>
				  <li>Seed  sanitation</li>
			    </ol>
				<h1>C.  Mid storage treatments</h1>
				<p>Seeds in storage accumulate damage to cell  membranes during senescence. Mid storage seed treatments are capable of  reducing the age induced damages and restoring the seed vigour to a certain  extent besides, the seed viability and productivity of stored seeds are also  improved.</p>
				<h1>i)  Hydration – Dehydration</h1>
				<p>It is the process of soaking the low and medium  vigour seeds in water with or without added chemicals usually for short  durations to raise the seed moisture content to 25 – 30% and drying back the  seeds to safe limits for dry storage.<br />
				  The hydration – dehydration treatments <br />
				  1.  Should be given only to stored seeds.<br />
				  2.  Is effective in low and medium vigour non-  leguminous seeds,<br />
				  3. The moisture  equilibration and moist sand conditioning treatments in which moisture is taken  up by the seed in a slow  and progressive  manner, are recommended for relatively high- vigour seeds and seeds of pulses  and leguminous vegetable crops<br />
				  6.  Direct soaking of leguminous seeds should be  avoided.<br />
				  7.  Would not make a seed germinable, which has  already lost viability.</p>
				<p><strong>Types of H-D treatments</strong><br />
				  The wet treatments include soaking-drying,  dipping-drying, spraying-drying, stepwise hydration-drying, moisture  equilibration-drying, moisture equilibration soaking-drying, moist and  conditioning-drying, etc. The choice of the treatment depends upon the  characteristics of seed and initial vigour status of the seeds.<br />
  <strong>Soaking – Drying (S-D)</strong><br />
				  Stored seed is soaked in water or solution of  chemicals sufficient to cover it and kept at room temperature for 2-6 hour  depending on the material with occasional stirring. The soaked seed is taken  out and after surface drying in the shade for some time, dried back to the  original moisture content Dilute solution of chemicals such as sodium or  potassium phosphate (di and mono basic), sodium chloride, <br />
				  p-hydroxy benzoic acid, p-amino benzoic acid, oxalic acid, potassium lodide,  etc can also be used at 10-4 to 10-3 M concentrations.  Fungicidal and insecticidal formulations can also be incorporated in the soak  water.<br />
  <strong>Dipping – Drying (D-D)</strong><br />
				  Seeds are dipped in water or solutions of the  aforesaid chemicals for only 2-5 minutes and the wet seed is taken out  immediately and kept covered for 2 – 6 hours depending on the material, for  absorption of surface water followed by drying back in S-D. This treatment is  effective in most high and high-medium vigour seeds of rice, wheat, jute,  summer and winter vegetables <br />
  <strong>Spraying – Drying</strong><br />
				  Seeds are spread in a thin layer and then an amount  of water (approximately 1/5 to ¼ of the seed weight) is sprayed on to it in two  equal installments (turning over the seed layer after the first spray) and  then kept covered by a polythene sheet for  2-4 hours before drying back.  This  treatment is similar to D-D in its efficacy and suitability.</p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Moisture equilibration – drying (ME – D)</strong><br />
				  Here, the seeds are placed in thin layers on trays  kept on a raised platform in a closed moisture saturated chamber lined  internally with moist blotters giving nearly 100% RH at room temperature. After  24-48 hours, depending on the material and ambient temperature, the seed is  dried back in the usual way. For soaking injury prone seeds this treatment,  which gives a slow and progressive rise in moisture content, is very effective.  ME-D, however, difficult to practice on a large scale and is not advocated for  low vigour non leguminous seeds because of possible aging effect of the  treatment especially when given for prolonged periods.<br />
  <strong>Moist sand conditioning – drying (MSC-D)</strong><br />
				  This treatment is similar to the moisture equilibration  treatment but easier to practice. For slow and progressive moisture uptake, the  seed is thoroughly mixed with pre-moistened sand, using  3 times the amount of air dry sand than seed.  Moisture content of sand is adjusted to 5-10 by adding the requisite amount of  water or solution of chemicals to previously washed and dried fine grain  building grade sand. The addition of water should be so adjusted as to get the  required hydration effect without initiating the germination process. After  mixing the dry seed with the premoistened sand, the mixture is kept at room  temperature for 16 – 36 hours depending on the material and sand moisture  content. The seed absorbs moisture from sand and after incubation the hydrated  seed is separated from sand by sieving and dried back to the original weight.<br />
				  Mode  of Action The main purpose of hydration is to raise the seed moisture content  to 25 –30% (wet weight basis) before drying back to safe limits for dry  storage. The hydration - dehydration treatment may improve the vigour by  controlling free radical reactions and consequent peroxidative damage to  lipoprotein cell membranes.</p>
				<p><strong>SEED TREATING EQUIPMENT</strong><br />
          Commercial seed treaters are designed  to apply accurately measured quantities of pesticides to a given weight of  seed. Basically, there are three types of commercial seed treaters on the  market: dust treaters, slurry treaters, and direct treaters-the Panogen and  Mist-O-Matic treaters are examples of direct treaters.</p>
				<p><strong>1. Dust Treater <em>(Gustafson XL Dry Powder  Seed Treater)</em></strong><br />
                    <strong>Controlling the  Flow of Seed: </strong><br />
				  The amount of seed which flows into  the weigh pan (which is just beneath the feed hopper on top of the treater) is  controlled by opening or closing the gates of the feed hopper by means of the  hand wheel on the side of the hopper. The scale on the hopper shows how far the  gates are open (in inches). Gates should be open to whatever number of inches  it takes to keep the weigh pan filled to the required number of pounds per dump  as it tilts in either direction. The number of pounds per<br />
				  dump  is adjusted by correctly setting the counterweight up or down on the  counterweight arm.<br />
  <strong>Powder Application:</strong><br />
				  To be sure that the correct amount of  powder is being applied to the seed flow, a preliminary test must be made in  which a given number of pounds of seed (such as 100 lbs) is run through the  feeder.</p>
				<p>          During this run, the measuring cup  provided with the feeder should be used to catch the powder as it comes off the  vibrator. After the given amount of seed has run through, the powder should be  weighed in order to determine how much is being applied to that amount of seed.  The vibrator speed can then be adjusted accordingly. Then a second or more  tests should be run until proper setting of the vibrator speed is determined  for correct coverage. </p>

				<p><strong>2.  Slurry Seed Treater</strong><br />
				  The slurry treatment principle  involves suspension of wettable powder treatment material in water. The  treatment material applied as a slurry is accurately metered through a simple  mechanism composed of a slurry cup and seed dump pan. The cup introduces a  given amount of slurry with each dump of seed into a mixing chamber where they  are blended.</p>
				<p>While  operation of the slurry treater is relatively simple, the various operation  procedures must be thoroughly understood.</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>The metering principle is the same in direct,  ready-mix or fully automatic treaters-i.e., the introduction of a fixed amount  of slurry to a given weight of seed.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>To obtain a given dump weight, slurry treaters  are equipped with a seed gate that controls seed flow to the dump pan. With the  proper seed gate setting, a constant dump weight for a given can be obtained.</li>
			    </ol>
				<ol>
				  <li>The amount of treatment material applied is  adjusted by the slurry concentration and the size of the slurry cup or bucket.  As the dump pan fills, a point is reached where it over-balances the counter  weight and dumps into the mixing chamber. This brings the alternate weighing  pan in position to receive the inflow of seed and activates a mechanism to add  a cup of slurry to the mixing chamber. Thus, one cup of slurry is added with each  dump of seed.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<ol>
				  <li><img width="307" height="402" src="lec29_clip_image002_0001.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" />The mixing chamber is fitted with an auger  type agitator that mixes and moves seed to the bagging end of the chamber. The  speed of the auger is important, because at slow speeds more uniform  distribution is obtained.</li>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Slurry  tanks have 15 to 35 gallon capacities, depending upon the size of the treater.  They are equipped with agitators that mix the slurry in the tank and keep it  suspended during operation. It is important that the powder be thoroughly  suspended in water before treating. If the treater has been idle for any period  of time, sediment in the bottom of the slurry cups must be cleaned out.</p>
				<p>          The proper size slurry cup must be  used. Most machines now have cups with ports and rubber plugs for 15 cc, 23 cc,  and 46 cc quantities. Some users prefer to mix the slurry in an auxiliary tank  and then transfer to the slurry chamber as needed.</p>
				<p><strong>DIRECT TREATERS</strong><br />
				  Direct treaters are the most recent  development and include the Panogen and Mist-O-Matic treaters. These two were initially  designed to apply undiluted liquid treatment. Instead of applying 23 cc of  material per 10 pounds of wheat, as in slurry treaters, they apply 14 to 21 cc  (1/2 to 3/4 ounces) per bushel of &quot;wheat. This small quantity of material  is suitable only with liquid materials which are somewhat volatile and do not  require complete, uniform coverage for effective action.<br />
				  Later modifications for direct  treaters include dual tanks that permit simultaneous addition of a fungicide  and an insecticide, and adaptations for the application of slurries. The  metering device used in both types of direct treater is similar to that of the  slurry treater, since it is attained through synchronization of a treatment cup  and seed dump. Otherwise, the two direct treaters differ decidedly from the  slurry treater and from each other. Both of these direct treaters have an  adjustable dump pan counter weight to adjust the weight of the seed dump. This  is not practical with slurry treaters.</p>
				<p><strong>3.  Panogen Seed treater</strong><br />
				  The operation of the Panogen treater  is relatively simple. A small treatment cup, operating from a rocker arm  directly off the seed dump pan and out of a small reservoir, meters one cup of  treatment with each dump of the seed pan. Fungicide flows through a tube to the  head of the revolving drum seed mixing chamber. It flows in with seed from the  dumping pan and is distributed over the seed by<br />
				  the  rubbing action of the seed passing through the revolving drum.<br />
				  The desired treating rate is obtained  by the size of the treatment cup and by adjusting the seed dump weight.  Treatment cup sizes are designated by treating rate in ounces and not by actual  size-e.g., the 3/4 ounce cup applies 3/4 ounce (22.5 cc) of treatment per  bushel with six dumps per bushel. The actual size of this cup is approximately  3.75cc.<br />

				  4. Mist-O-Matic Seed Treater:</strong><br />
The  &quot;mist-o-matic&quot; treater applies treatment as a mist directly to the  seed. The metering operation of the treatment cups and seed dump is similar to  that of the &quot;Panogen&quot; treater. Cup sizes are designated by the number  of cc's they actually deliver-e.g., 2  ½ <em>, </em>5, 10, 20 and 40. The treater is equipped with a large  treatment tank, a pump and a return that maintains the level in the small  reservoir from which the treatment cups are fed. </p>
				<p>          After metering, the treatment material  flows to a rapidly revolving, fluted disc mounted under a seed-spreading cone.  The disc breaks droplets of the treatment solution into a fine mist and sprays  it outward to coat seed falling over the cone through the treating chamber.  Just below the seed dump are two adjustable retarders designed to give a  continuous flow of seed over the cone between seed dumps. This is important  since there is a continuous misting of material from the revolving disc. The  desired treating rate is obtained through selection of treatment cup size and  proper adjustment of the seed dump weight.</p>
