				<p>Seed  pricing involves setting prices when a new product is launched or a new  distribution channel is used. Also, decisions may need to be taken to change  the price in response to competition and to the general market situation.<br />
In  the public sector prices are often based on an economic pricing policy.  Economic pricing considers the effect of seed price on the economy, taking into  account the amount officials think farmers can afford to pay and the role of  the seed industry in the development of agricultural production. Ideally,  however, the public sector should follow a more commercial pricing policy which  accounts for all costs and allows for an element of profit.<br />
Some  objectives in government seed pricing could be:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>to  induce farmers to use certified seed of improved varieties in order to increase  national production</li>
				  <li>to  provide adequate incentives to seed producers to supply seed in sufficient  quantity to meet demand</li>
				  <li>to  encourage the development of private distribution channels</li>
				  <li>to  implement government agro-economic policies.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Some  objectives in private sector seed pricing are likely to be:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>props maximization which  will be the long-term target although there may be many other shorter term  considerations which will influence pricing policy, such as increasing market  share and gaining acceptance of new products</li>
				  <li>price competition, may  be achieved by setting a price that gives a competitive edge in the market  place but may not be lower than that of a rival because other factors, such as<strong> </strong>service, will be  contributing to a company's competitive advantage</li>
				  <li>a  yield 01? investment which must be at least as  good as other uses for investors' funds.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><a name="Pricing_strategies" id="Pricing_strategies"><strong>Pricing  strategies</strong></a> <br />
				  Once a company's seed pricing  objectives have been established, different pricing strategies must be  considered. These include:<br />
  <strong>Low  price strategy</strong> <br />
				  Low price strategies are used where  consumers respond very positively to small downward changes in price, but a  company may not always gain from setting low prices as more efficient  competitors may respond with similar price cuts. If the product is not  particularly price sensitive then the net effect of a price reduction can  simply mean a reduction in revenue. A company may be tempted to reduce its  price where similar or substitute products are also sold or when there is an  oversupply. However, seeds can become devalued by selling them cheaply  especially where there are real benefits associated with the product. Imported  vegetable seeds are often chosen by farmers in preference to locally produced  varieties in the belief that they are better because they are more expensive.  It is therefore critically important to understand the likely response of the  farmer when adopting a low price strategy.<br />
  <strong>Market  price strategy</strong> <br />
				  Where a few large companies dominate  supply, products tend to be similar (known in the seed industry as  &quot;me-too&quot; varieties) and the role of price tends to be neutral, i.e. a  market price is established.<br />
  <strong>High  price strategy</strong> <br />
				  This strategy can be used as a long-  or short-term policy. In the case of the long-term policy the company will have  identified a market segment for a high quality, value-added product such as  graded and treated seed for precision drilling. A high price will reflect the  exclusive image or added value of the product. A short-term, high-price policy  takes advantage of a new product introduced onto the market, as may be the case  with a new high-yielding variety where supply is limited.<br />
  <a name="Pricing_techniques" id="Pricing_techniques"><strong>Pricing  techniques</strong></a> <br />
				  The important influences on pricing  are cost, demand, prices of the product's main competitors and short-term sales  targets.<br />
  <strong>Cost-plus  pricing</strong> <br />
				  This method involves calculating the  unit cost of a product and adding the appropriate profit margin to give a base  price which might then be altered in relation to prevailing market conditions.  While this seems a simple approach the fact that such pricing is production  oriented and may therefore not reflect what is happening in the market place,  makes it risky. A rigid application of cost-plus pricing may lead to price  increases when demand is lower and reductions when demand is strong. This is  the opposite of what should normally be done.</p>
				<p><strong>Contribution  pricing</strong> <br />
				  This is a form of cost-plus pricing  which involves separating the different products that make up the product  portfolio and allocating to them the direct costs associated with their  production. The price is determined at a level which will generate revenues in  excess of these costs, thereby contributing towards meeting business overheads.  Individual products can be analysed in terms of their ability to cover their  direct costs and contribute to overheads.<br />
  <strong>Competitive  pricing</strong> <br />
				  Where there is market competition,  costs cannot always be the determining factor in pricing. Here the nature and  extent of competition will have a major influence on the price. If a product is  faced with direct competition from similar products the price will be  restrained. In contrast, when a product is faced by indirect competition from  products in different sectors of the market there will be more scope to vary  the price. This provides the possibility of using different strategies.<br />
  <strong>Short-term  pricing techniques</strong> <br />
				  Pricing can be a useful tool for  pursuing short-term marketing and sales targets. When a new variety is launched  higher prices can be set, providing the opportunity of earning higher returns  from those farmers willing to pay the higher prices before seed becomes more  widely available. Lower prices may be linked to promotional activities such as  boosting sales of established varieties, creating interest in new ones,  reducing high stocks and encouraging farmers to buy early.<br />
  <strong>An overview of factors affecting the seed industry</strong> <br />
				  Three broad influences determine the development  and status of the seed industry, namely:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Technology  - especially the flow of new varieties from research;</li>
				  <li>Economics  - both of seed production itself and of the agricultural sector generally; and</li>
				  <li>Policy  - creates the commercial and financial environment.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>          All  of these factors can be modified and there are many interactions between them  that ultimately determine the size, viability and other characteristics of the  seed industry. Figure 1 provides a diagrammatic representation of this  analysis, in which various influences on the seed sector are represented within  the triangle formed by these three primary elements. Policy has been placed at  the top because of the major impact it can have on technology and economics. At  the centre lies the production environment, which forms the basis for  agriculture, and which cannot be substantially modified, except by irrigation  or protected cultivation.<br />
                    <img width="624" height="474" src="lec32_clip_image002.jpg" alt="http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/Y2722E/y2722e05.gif" /> <br />
				  We  should recognize seed policy as a major tool for change, but also accept that  it cannot alter certain physical and environmental factors and, in a free  market, it will always interact with technology and economics. In addition to  the policy designed specifically for seeds, wider social and environmental  policies may also have an impact on the seed sector and these may be driven by  public awareness. For example, the current debate in Europe about the use of  genetically-modified crops is not primarily conducted on technical issues about  seeds but on wider environmental and food safety concerns. It has nonetheless  had a major effect on the seed industry.</p>
