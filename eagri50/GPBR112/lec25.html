				<p>Intellectual  property rights (IPRs) can be broadly defined as legal rights established over  creative or inventive ideas. Such legal rights generally allow right holders to  exclude the unauthorized commercial use of their creations/inventions by third  persons. The rationale for the establishment of a legal framework on IPRs is  that it is a signal to society that creative and inventive ideas will be  rewarded. There are two broad categories of IPRs: one, industrial property2  covering IPRs such as patents, trademarks, geographical indications and  industrial designs; two, copyright and related rights covering artistic and  literary works, performances, broadcasts and the like. IPRs that do not fit  into this classical division are termed <em>sui generis</em>, meaning  one-of-its-kind. Such <em>sui generis </em>rights include those covering lay-out  designs of semi conductor chips and plant breeders’ rights.</p>
				<p><strong>IPRS  Relevant to Agriculture</strong></p>
				<p>          Several of the IPRs mentioned above  are relevant to the agricultural sector in that they can be used to protect  goods or services produced in the agricultural sector. These are mainly  patents, plant breeders’ rights, trademarks, geographical indications and trade  secrets. <strong></strong><br />
				  Patents are probably the most  important IPR today for agricultural goods and services as they provide,  wherever these are available, the strongest protection for patentable plants  and animals and biotechnological processes for their production. Patents  universally give the patentee the right to prevent third parties from making,  using or selling the patented product or process. Patents, however, have to be  disclosed to the public through the patent documents. This enables researchers  to develop further useful products or services. Patentable products have to  meet the criteria of patentability, viz., novelty, i.e. that which is not known  in the prior art, non-obviousness i.e. that which involves an inventive step  and usefulness i.e. that which is industrially applicable. With some  differences the patent laws of all countries follow these criteria. However,  not all countries allow the patenting of plants and animals or even  microorganisms or biotechnological processes.</p>
				<p>          Biotechnology is the sector that holds  the most potential for advances in agriculture to improve productivity.  Biotechnology R&amp;D is mostly concentrated in the hands of large  multinational enterprises in the US, Europe and Japan. This gave rise to the  patenting of micro-organisms found in nature, if it involved a new, inventive  and useful technical intervention by man. Thus, research on the cloning of  animals, which is advancing rapidly, would be eligible for patents in at least  some developed countries. </p>
				<p>           Many countries have developed plant breeders'  rights to reward conventional plant breeding efforts. Such <em>sui generis </em>protection  is weaker than patent protection in that the right holders can only prevent  third parties from commercially exploiting the protected material. The criteria  used to grant such protection is also lower than that used to determine  patentability as these are distinctness, i.e. distinguishable from earlier  known varieties, uniformity i.e.display of the same essential characteristics  in every plant and stability i.e. the retention of the essential  characteristics on reproduction. Such protection encourages breeding efforts in  the private sector. Historically, in developing countries, such efforts have  emanated from the public sector or from international research institutions. It  is only in recent years that developing countries have begun to institute such  protection.</p>
				<p><strong>The Protection of Plant Variety and Farmers  Rights Act 2001</strong><br />
                  <br />
				  India’s  plant variety protection and Farmers’ Rights Act, 2001 The General Agreement on  Trade and Tariffs (GATT), the predecessor to the World Trade Organization  (WTO), was established to restore world trade after the end of the Second World  War in 1945. Several GATT rounds starting from 1948, dealt with the quotas and  duties of tradable commodities between nations. The 1986 GATT Round, popularly  known as the Uruguay Round, brought in new elements into the trade discussion,  especially relating to agriculture. One of the most controversial agreements of  the Uruguay Round is that relating to the granting of Intellectual Property Rights  on biological materials embodied in the Trade Related Intellectual.<br />
                  <br />
				  TRIPS specifically require  member nations to grant patents on microorganisms, non/biological and  microbiological processes as well as effective IPR protection for plant varieties.<br />
				  TRIPS provide a choice for protecting  plant varieties. Members may choose from patents, a sui generis system or a  combination of the two. Most developing countries including India have decided  not to have patents for plant varieties and have chosen the sui generis option  instead. The sui generis system (translating roughly into selfgenerating) means  any system a country decides on, provided it grants effective Plant Breeders’  Rights. TRIPS does not specify what kind of breeders’ rights is meant and it  does not say what else a member state can include in its law, apart from  breeders’ rights. In short, TRIPS is a flexible system, which leaves a lot to  the discretion of members. As a response to the TRIPS agreement, India has  started enacting a series of domestic laws to implement the commitments it has  made. The Plant Variety Protection and Farmers Rights Act, 2001, is the Indian  sui generis legislation. The Indian law, which has been hailed as a  progressive, pro-developing country legislation, has some notable features.  Apart from a well-defined breeders’ right, it has strong and proactive farmers’  rights. In fact the Indian legislation succeeds in balancing the rights of  Breeders and Farmers and exploits the flexibility granted in TRIPS, in an  intelligent manner. There are clauses to protect the rights of researchers and  provisions to protect the public interest.<br />
                  <br />
				  The Indian legislation is the first in the world to grant formal rights to  farmers in a way that their self-reliance is not jeopardized. What is significant  and positive about this legislation is that it charts its own course, deviating  from the norms set by the Union for the Protection of New Plant Varieties  (UPOV). UPOV is at present the only platform for regulating plant breeders’  rights. It is a platform for developed countries which is modulated to protect  the interests of agriculture in industrial countries. It does not even have the  notion of farmers rights. The innovative Indian legislation has opened up  interesting possibilities for developing a developing country platform for  regulating breeders’ and farmers’ rights so that both, not just one, are  acknowledged and protected. The salient features of the new law are described  in this article.<br />
                  <strong>Breeders  Rights</strong><br />
                On  registration of a particular variety, the plant breeder has rights of  commercialization for the registered variety either in his/her own person or  through a designated person. These rights include the right to produce, sell,  market, distribute, import or export a variety, in short, full control over  formal marketing. Violation of the breeder's right can be construed at several  levels. It applies to the variety itself as also to its packaging. Infringement  will be established if the packaging is the same or even similar, such that the  package could appear to be that of the Breeder. Legally, a similar looking  package will be considered &quot;Passing Off&quot; and so actionable. Any one  other than the breeder can not use the registered name or denomination. The use  of the same or similar name in any way, by action or even suggestion, will  constitute a violation and will be punishable. Penalties are prescribed for  applying false denomination and for selling varieties to which false  denomination is applied.</p>
				<p><strong>Farmers  Rights</strong><br />
				  The  Act recognizes the farmer not just as a cultivator but also as a conserver of  the agricultural gene pool and a breeder who has bred several successful  varieties. There are provisions for such farmers' varieties to be registered  with the help of NGOs so that they are protected against being scavenged by  formal sector breeders. The law allows the farmer to sell seed in the way he  has always done, with the restriction that this seed can not be branded with  the Breeder's registered name. In this way, both farmers and breeders rights  are protected. The breeder is rewarded for his innovation by having control of  the commercial market place but without being able to threaten the farmers'  ability to independently engage in his livelihood, and supporting the  livelihood of other farmers.<br />
				  Apart  from the right to sell non-branded seed of protected varieties, the rights of  farmers and local communities are protected in other ways too. There are  provisions for acknowledging the role of rural communities as contributors of  landraces and farmer varieties in the breeding of new plant varieties .  Breeders wanting to use farmers varieties for creating Essentially Derived  Varieties (EDVs) can not do so without the express permission of the farmers  involved in the conservation of such varieties. Any one is entitled to register  a community's claim and have it duly recorded at a notified center. This  intervention enables the registration of farmer varieties even if the farmers  themselves cannot do this due to illiteracy or lack of awareness. If the claim  on behalf of the community is found to be genuine, a procedure is initiated for  benefit sharing so that a share of profits made from the use of a farmer  variety in a new variety goes into a National Gene Fund.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Protection against Bad  Seed </strong><br />
				  In  providing a liability clause in the section on Farmers Rights, the farmer in  principle is protected against the supply of spurious and/ or poor quality seed  leading to crop failures. But at present there is too much left to the  discretion of the Plant Variety Authority which will fix the compensation. This  could lead to arbitrary decisions and should be amended. (Sahai, 2001 a,b)<br />
  <strong>Rights  of Researchers</strong><br />
				  All  IPR systems must strike a balance between the monopoly granted to the IPR  holder, in this case the plant breeder, and the benefits to society, in this  case the farmers and consumers. Since nobody concerned with public interest  would want plant breeding to shift into just a few hands, it is important to  maintain competition and vitality in the plant breeding sector. That is why freedom  and rights for other researchers to use all genetic material, including IPR  protected material, is important. The Bill has provisions for researcher’s  rights which allows scientists and breeders to have free access to registered  varieties for research. The registered variety can also be used for the purpose  of creating other, new varieties. The breeder cannot stop other breeders from  using his/her variety to breed new crop varieties except when the registered  variety needs to be used repeatedly as a parental line. In that case  authorization is required.<br />
				  There  is however some difference of opinion. Some view that the Indian law actually  grants very restricted rights to researchers because of the acknowledgment of  Essentially Derived Varieties, EDV. It is felt that all kinds of research will  become subject to the breeders authorization if a protected variety is used for  research. In the Indian Act, the Breeders authorization is needed for making  EDVs.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Protection of Public  Interest </strong><br />
				  The  PPV legislation includes public interest clauses, like exclusion of certain  varieties from protection and the grant of Compulsory Licensing. To secure  public interest, certain varieties may not be registered if it is felt that  prevention of commercial exploitation of such variety is necessary to  &quot;protect order or public morality or human, animal and plant life and  health or to avoid serious prejudice to the environment&quot;.<br />
				  The  Act also provides for the granting of compulsory license to a party other than  the holder of the Breeders certificate if it is shown that the reasonable  requirements for seeds have not been satisfied or that the seed of the variety  is not available to the public at a reasonable price. The breeder is entitled  to file an opposition but should the charge be valid, the breeder may be  ordered by the Authority to grant a compulsory license under certain terms and  conditions including the payment of a reasonable license fee. Compulsory  License however will not be awarded if the Breeder can demonstrate reasonable grounds  for his inability to produce the seed.</p>
