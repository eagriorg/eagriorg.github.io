				<p>The four generally recognized classes  of seeds are: Breeder's seed, Foundation seed, Registered seed and Certified  seed.  The Association of Official Seed  Certifying Agencies (AOSCA) has defined these seed classes as follows:<br />
                  <strong>Breeder  seed</strong> <br />
The seed or vegetatively  propagated material directly controlled by the originating or the sponsoring  breeder or institution which is the basic seed for recurring increase of  foundation seed.<br />
<strong>Foundation  seed</strong> <br />
It is the progeny of  breeder seed. The seed stock handled to maintain specific identity and genetic  purity, which may be designated or distributed and produced under careful  supervision of an agricultural experiment station. This seed is the source of  all other certified seed classes either directly or through registered seed.<br />
<strong>Registered  seed</strong> <br />
The progeny of the  foundation seed so handled as to maintain its genetic identity and purity and  approved and certified by a certifying agency.   It should be of quality suitable to produce certified seed.<br />
<strong>Certified  seed</strong> <br />
It is the progeny of the  foundation seed. Its production is so handled to maintain genetical identity  and physical purity according to standards specified for the crop being  certified. It should have the minimum genetical purity of 99%. Certified seed  may be the progeny of certified seed , provided this reproduction does not  exceed two generations beyond foundation   seed and provided that if certification agency determines the genetic  and physical purity,  if  not be significantly altered. In case of highly  self pollinated crops certification of one further generation may be permitted.  Certified seed produced from certified seed shall be eligible for further seed  increase under certification, except in case of highly self-pollinated crops,  where certification of one further generation may be permitted. Certification  tags issued once for certified seed not eligible for further seed increase  under certification. </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>For paddy and wheat ,  certified seed produced from certified seed is eligible for certification by  NSC up to two generations from foundation seed<strong></strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p>     Foundation seed - Certified seed (I) -  Certified seed (II)</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>For barley, garden pea  ,ground nut, soyabean, certified seed produced from certified seed is eligible  for certification up to 3 generations from foundation seed</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>     Foundation seed - Certified seed (I) -  Certified seed (II) - Certified seed (III)</p>

                <h2 align="left">Generation system of seed multiplication</h2>
                <p>Generation system of seed  multiplication is nothing but the production of a particular class of seed from  specific class of seed up to certified seed stage. The choice of a proper seed  multiplication model is the key to further success of a seed programme. This  basically depends upon</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The rate of genetic  deterioration</li>
                  <li>Seed multiplication ratio  and</li>
                  <li>Total seed demand</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Based on these factors  different seed multiplication models may be derived for each crop and the seed  multiplication agency should decide how quickly the farmers can be supplied  with the seed of newly released varieties, after the nucleus seed stock has  been handed over to the concerned agency, so that it may replace the old varieties.  In view of the basic factors, the chain of seed multiplication models could  be.,</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Three - Generation model </strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p> Breeder seed - Foundation seed - Certified  seed<br />
                    <strong>b.  Four   - Generation model</strong><br />
                  Breeder seed - Foundation seed (I) Foundation  seed (II) - Certified seed<br />
  <strong>c.  Five   - Generation model </strong><br />
                  Breeder seed - Foundation  seed (I)- Foundation seed (II) -Certified seed (I) - Certified seed (II)<br />
                  For most of the often  cross pollinated and cross pollinated crops 3 &amp; 4 generation models is  usually suggested for seed multiplication. <strong>Ex:</strong> Castor, Redgram, Jute, Greengram, Rape, Mustard, Sesame, Sunflower and most of  the vegetable crops. </p>
                <h1 align="left">GENERATION SYSTEM OF SEED  MULTIPLICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL (NOTIFIED VARIETIES AND HYBRIDS)</h1>
                <p align="left"><img src="215165" /></p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Nucleus and Breeders seed production</strong> <br />
  &nbsp;         The initial handful of seeds obtained  from selected individual plants of a particular variety, for the purposes  purifying and maintaining that variety by the originating plant breeder and its  further multiplication under his own supervision, or the supervision of a  qualified plant breeder, to provide Breeder’s Seed constitutes the basis for  all further seed production. The varietal purity of subsequently multiplied  foundation, registered and certified seed largely depend upon the quality of  the nucleus/breeder’s seed. Unless the nucleus/ breeder’s seed is of highest  purity and quality the seed multiplied from it cannot be regarded as of  satisfactory genetic purity. Unsatisfactory genetic purity, especially in cross  pollinated crops, could ultimately severely affect the performance of a  variety. It is therefore, of utmost importance that the nucleus/breeder’s seed  is produced in such a manner that satisfactory genetic purity, identity and the  other good qualities of seed are maintained. <br />
  <strong>Methods of maintenance of  nucleus and breeder’s seed in self fertilized crops</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                  Methods  of maintaining nucleus seed/breeder’s can be conveniently divided into the  following two groups: </p>
                <ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Maintenance       of newly released varieties </li>
                  <li>Maintenance       of established varieties </li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Maintenance of Nucleus  Seed of Pre-released or Newly Released Varieties</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                  The  procedure outlined by Harrington (1952) for the maintenance of nucleus seed of  pre-released or newly released varieties is described below: </p>
                <ol start="1" type="a">
                  <li>Sampling       of the variety to obtain nucleus seed. New numbers, lines or selection       which are highly promising, on the basis of performance in breeding       nurseries and yield trials, should be sampled for seed purification. These       samples provide a beginning for purifying new varieties and for possible       increase and distribution to farmers. Not more than fifteen new varieties       in any one crop at a station should be sampled in one year. </li>
                  <li>Table       examination of samples: The two hundred plants of each sample should be       threshed separately and the seed should be examined in piles on the table.       Discard any pile appearing obviously off type, diseased or otherwise       unacceptable. The seeds of each two hundred plant samples or less is now       ready to be sown in a variety purification nursery called as nucleus. </li>
                  <li>Locating       and seeding of nucleus: Each nucleus seed should be grown on clean fertile       land at an experiment station in the region or in area in which this new       variety could be grown, in the event of its release. The land must not       have had a crop of the same kind in the previous year. </li>
                  <li>Inspection       of nucleus two-row plots and removal of off types: Throughout the season       of growth, from the seedling stage until maturity, the nucleus plot should       be examined critically. Differences in the habit of early plant growth, leaf       colour, rate of growth, time of heading, height head characteristics and       diseases reactions should be looked for. If a plot differs distinctly from       the average in the preheading stages of growth, it should be removed       before heading. </li>
                  <li>Harvesting       and threshing of nucleus; each remaining plot, of which there should be at       least 180 out of the original 200. Should be harvested individually with a       sickle and tied in a bundle. The total bundles of each nucleus should be       labelled and stored until the current years yield rests for trials are       obtained. The nucleus bundles of any new variety should be discarded, if       it is found unworthy of being continued. </li>
                </ol>
                <p>          Later the seed should be cleaned in a  fanning mill or by hand methods, the grain from each nucleus plot being placed  in a pile on the seed table. The 180 or more piles of seed of one nucleus must  be examined for approximate uniformity of seed appearance, and any pile, which  appears to be off type discarded. All the remaining piles of the seed should be  masked together in one lot. This should treated with fungicide and insecticide,  bagged, labelled and stored as &quot;Breeder’s Stock Seed&quot; for use in the  next year. Breeder’s stock seed is the original purified seed stock of a new  variety in the hands of the plant breeders. <br />
                    <strong>Maintenance of Breeder’s  Seed of Pre-released or Newly Released Varieties</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                  The  following steps are involved in the maintenance of breeder’s seed. </p>
                <ol start="1" type="a">
                  <li>Breeder’s       stock seed from the nucleus should be sown on the clean, fertile land,       which did not grow a crop of the same kind in the previous year. The space       required for the seeding the breeder’s stock is about 1.2 ha in the case       of wheat and as much as 3 ha in the case of transplanted rice. </li>
                  <li>The       field should properly isolated. </li>
                  <li>The       best farm procedures should be used in the sowing, raising and harvesting       of breeder’s stock. </li>
                  <li>It       should be produced at the experiment station in the area in which the new       variety has been bred. </li>
                  <li>The       seeding should be done in such a way as to make the best use of the       limited amount of seed available and to facilitate roguing. The row       spacing should be sufficient to permit examination of plants in rows for       possible mixture or off types. </li>
                  <li>Roguing:       All plants not typical of the variety should be pulled and removed. There       should be very few plants to rogue out if the previous years nucleus       breeder’s stock seed was well protected from natural crossing and careful       roguing was done and there were no impurities during cleaning etc. The       rouging should be done before flowering, as was done for the nucleus/breeder’s       stock seed. </li>
                  <li>Harvesting       the breeder’s stock: In the breeder’s stock is harvested and threshed, the       equipment used must be scrupulously clean and free from seeds of any other       varieties. This cleanliness should be extended to cards and bags as well       as threshing machine it self. The seed should now be about 99.9 per cent       pure as to variety. These breeder’s seed is ready now for increase of       foundation seed. A portion of this breeder’s seed should be retained by       the breeders to sown a continuation breeders seed of the variety. </li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Maintenance of breeder’s  seed of established varieties</strong><br />
                  The  breeder’s seed of established varieties could be maintained satisfactorily by  any one of the following methods <br />
  <strong>a) By raising the crop in  isolation:</strong> The breeder’s seed of local varieties could be maintained by growing them in  isolated plots and by very rigorous roguing during various stages of crop  growth, where the various plant characters are observable. The method of  handling the breeder seed crop is the same as described earlier for breeder’s  seed of newly released varieties. <br />
  <strong>b) By bulk selection:</strong> The genetic purity of  established varieties could be satisfactorily improved by bulk selection. In  this method 2,000 to 2,500 plants typical of the variety are selected, harvested  ,and threshed separately. The seeds from each plant are examined and any pile  which shows any obvious off-types, or otherwise appears dissimilar, are  discarded. The remaining piles of seed are bulked to constitute the breeder’s  seed. The other practices of handling remains the same. <br />
  <strong>Carry-over Seed</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                The  breeder must carry-over at least enough seed to safeguard against, the loss of  variety if there is a complete failure during the foundation seed  multiplication phase. In addition, the breeder should further safeguard variety  by arranging to have a portion of the seed originally released stored under the  ideal conditions. &nbsp;</p>
