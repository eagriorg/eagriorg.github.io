				<p>Onion  is one of the most important commercial vegetable crops in India. Maharastra,  Gujarat, Uttra Pradesh, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh are the major onion growing  states. The total annual area is estimated to be about 3 lakhs hectare and  production is about 35.37 lakh tonnes. It is grown mainly in rabi season. Three  crops<em> viz.,</em> Kharif, late Kharif and rabi are taken in Nasik division of  Maharashtra whereas Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Harayana,  Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu take up two crops that is Kharif and  rabi. Kharif onion is a recent introduction in Northern, Eastern and Central  India.<br />
                  <strong>Botany</strong><br />
          Onion is the biennial crop and takes two full seasons to produce seeds.  In the first year bulbs are formed and in the second year stalks develop and  seed are produced. It is <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion">a  long-day plant</a></strong>. The day length influences bulb onion, but has little  effect on induction of seeding. It appears to be <strong><a href="http://www.vegetableexpert.co.uk/searchresultscss.cfm">day-neutral</a></strong> for seed production. It requires cool conditions during early development of  the bulb crop and again prior to and during early growth of seed stalk.  Varieties bolt readily at 10 to 15 degree C. In the early stages of growth, a  good supply of moisture is required and temperatures should be fairly cool.  During bulbing, harvesting and <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Onion_Girl">curing</a></strong> of seed,  fairly high temperatures and low humidity is desirable. Seed production is  widely adapted to temperate and sub-tropical regions.<br />

				<p><strong>Season </strong><br />
				  The optimum sowing season is middle of  June to Middle of July in the plains.<strong></strong><br />
  &nbsp;<strong>Isolation  Requirements</strong><strong></strong><br />
				  Onion is largely  cross-pollinated crop with up to 93 per cent natural crossing but some  self-pollination does occur. It is chiefly pollinated by honey-bees. For pure  seed production, the seed fields must be isolated from fields of other  varieties of onion and fields of the same variety not conforming to varietal  purity requirements for certification atleast by 1000 metres for foundation  seed production and 500 metres for certified seed production.<br />
  <strong>Method  of Seed Production</strong><strong> </strong><br />
				  There are two methods of seed production<br />
				  1.<strong> Seed to seed method</strong>: In this method, the  first season bulb crop is left to over-winter in the field so as to produce  seed in the following season.<br />
				  2.<strong> Bulb to seed method:</strong> The bulbs produced in  the previous season are lifted, selected, stored and replanted to produce seed  in the second year.<br />
				  Mostly the bulb to seed method is used for seed production because of the  following advantages over the seed to seed method.<br />
				  a) It permits selections of &quot;true-to-type&quot; and healthy bulbs for seed  production.<br />
				  b) Seed yields are comparatively very high. The seed to seed method, however,  can be practiced for varieties having a poor keeping quality. <br />
  <strong><img border="0" width="430" height="322" src="lec21_clip_image004.jpg" alt="PIC4" /></strong><strong> </strong></p>
				<p><strong>Bulb  to seed method</strong><br />
                    <strong>A.  Bulb Production stage </strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Climatic  requirement </strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Though it is possible to produce bulbs in different  climatic conditions, mild climate is reported to be very good. For better bulb  production a temperature of 15.5 to 210C and about 70% relative  humidity required.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Land  requirement </strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Fields in which onion was grown should be selected  unless it was of the same variety and was certified. The onion can be grown on  various types but it grows best in soils which are able to retain moisture for  longer time. Heavy soils do not permit proper bulb development and many times  bulbs are misshapen. 6-8 pH range are considered better for onion. </p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Isolation requirement </strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Onion is highly cross pollinated crop with upto 93%  natural crossing. It is mostly pollinated by honeybees. For pure seed  production the seed fields must be isolated from field of other varieties of  onion of the dame colour at least by 1000 meters for foundation seed and 500 m  for certified seed. The isolation distance between colour particularly white  and red colour must be much more which needs to be decided. </p>

				  <li><strong>Spacing </strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p>15 x 10 cm. More spacing between plants results in  thick necked plants.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Irrigation </strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Irrigation should be given at fortnightly interval or  weekly interval as the case may be. Field should not be left dry for long  otherwise splitting problem is more.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Weeding </strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p>          2-3 weedings and hoeings are done.  Stomp @ 3.51 / ha may be applied 3 days after transplanting to manage the weeds  economically. One weeding by hand is, however, necessary.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Plant protection </strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p>          Malathion @ 0.1% along with tritone  against thrips. 4-5 spraying may be necessary. Indofil M45 @ 0.25% along with tritone<strong> </strong>against purple blotch  and stemphylium<strong> </strong>blight,  5-6 sprayings may be done.</p>
				<p><strong>k)  Roguing </strong><br />
				  Remove off type plants on difference  in colour of leaves or plant type. Remove resprouted plants or premature  bolters.</p>
				<p><strong>l)  Harvesting </strong><br />
          Harvesting the crops one week after  50% of tops falling and keep in windrow<strong> </strong>upto 3-5 days for field curing. After that bulbs are cured in shade  to remove fields heat before keeping in store. In kharif bulbs are ready for  harvesting within 90-100 days after transplanting while tops are still erect.  Bulbs are allowed for field curing upto 3-5 days then again cured were in shade  or in field depending upon the temperature for 12-15 days. Tops are cut leaving  2.5 cm neck.</p>

				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Selection  of bulb </strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>True to type bulbs are selected based  on colour, size and shape kept in ventilated storage in rabi crop and in kharif  crop bulbs are planted after curing for 15 days. 4-6 cm size bulbs are selected  for getting good crop.<br />
                    <img width="259" height="234" src="lec21_clip_image006_0000.jpg" /></p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Climate </strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>Conditioning of plants / bulbs is necessary for seed stalks formation. Temperature of 4.50c  to 140C are favourable for this conditioning. Longer this prevails,  more stalks each plant will produce and more flowers will be in each umbel. Low  humidity gives good seed development. While plants are in flowering clear  bright sunny days are necessary for good insect activity.</p>

				<p><strong>Problems  and Prospects of certification in onion seed production </strong><br />
				  Following are the problems and  remedial measures in certification of onion seed: </p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Unawareness about the  notified varieties by the farmers</strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>          Many improved and notified varieties  have not been demonstrated fully with the farmers as such farmers still prefer  old varieties. The extension agencies in the state may therefore take up  demonstration so as to allow farmers to know about the new improved varieties.</p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Unawareness about the  advantage of certified seed over truthful seed </strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>          In cereals and some other seeds the  seed production and distribution programme are properly organized. Farmers have  been demonstrated with the advantage of using certified seed. In vegetables  particularly in small seed such demonstrations or extension education  programmes have not been carried out. Farmers thus are not aware about the  benefits of using certified seed in onion. Extension agencies should arrange  state level demonstrations on use of certified seed in onion to make the farmer  fully aware of advantages of the certified seed. </p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>No maintenance breeding  for improved varieties</strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>          Since varieties when developed by the  Universities / institutes do not pass through maintenance breeding later, the  varieties do not behave in different characters in the same way as these were  at the time of development. The application of certification standards  particularly for genetics purity therefore becomes impossible. The Universities  / Institutes should continue maintenance breeding of their varieties for maintaining  distinctiveness, uniformity and stability. </p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Most of the parameters of  the varieties are influenced by agro climatic conditions</strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>          In onion there are many characters  like colour, shape, bolting, neck thickness or doubles which are affected  adversely by agro climatic conditions like soil, temperature, rainfall,  cultural practices etc. Practical application of certification standards  required to be seen at the time of certification where staff cannot have proper  judgment. The staff should, therefore, know the details of characters and how  and to what extent, they are influenced by adverse weather conditions. Based on  that the staff should assess the situation and apply their mind in certifying a  crop.</p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Staff with certification  agencies are neither adequate nor they have proper knowledge about the crop.</strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>          Onion is highly cross-pollinated crop  and it requires through inspection or check at different stages. If one stage  is left it becomes difficult to meet the requirements. For example if  inspection is not managed at the time of bulb selection, Similarly if isolation  is not checked at the time of <strong>bolting</strong> it becomes a frutile exercise later as roughing has no meaning at the time of  flowering. This is possible only when sufficient staff having good knowledge about  onion is provided. </p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Unawareness of farmers  about pre harvest and post harvest practices of onion seed production.</strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>          The extension agencies as also staff  certification agencies are supposed to properly guide for production and post  harvest practices for certified seed production initially. Certification staffs  presently do not guide. Presently since staff themselves are not aware about  pre harvest practices as also post harvest practices, programmes many times  fail as such farmers hesitate in going for certified seed production. It is,  therefore, necessary for certification staff to guide the farmers initially. </p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Inadequate infrastructural  facilities for storage of bulbs, cleaning, grading and drying</strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>          Bulbs of rabi onion are required to be  stored in ventilated godowns which are not available. Seed requires is must  which is mostly not available. Similarly for enabling the seed producers to  pack the seed in moisture proof containers for long term storage, seeds are  required to be dried to 6% moisture where dehumidified driers are required.  Such facilities are lacking at any places.</p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong> Certification standards are not realistic</strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>          Presently standards which have been  fixed are not realistic. The standards need to be fixed based on the type of  material being developed by the institutes. The effects of agro climatic  conditions on different parameters need to be considered. Isolation distances  are not adequate particularly between white and red varieties. </p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Non availability of  adequate quality breeder / foundation seed of a variety </strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>          Even if everyone is ready for taking  up certified seed production, adequate quality breeder seed foundation seed  with the concerned institute is not available. Because of this problem in fact  many good varieties in onion have been lost before going to farmers. The seed  production programme, therefore, should be properly planned right from  production of breeder seed to certified seed so as to make available quality  seed in adequate quantities for improving production and quality. </p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong> Low price of seed available in the market </strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>          Many times onion seed price in the  market are very low compared to quality seed / certified seed. This is mainly  because farmers collect seed from premature bolters / takes up <em>in situ</em> method where though quality is poor quality is in abundance, Govt. should,  therefore give some.</p>
