				<p>Availability  of quality seeds of improved cultivars is considered crucial for realizing  productivity and adoption of cultivars in different agro-climatic conditions.  The quality of seed alone is known to account for at least 10-15% increase in  the productivity (ICAR 1993). However, lack of quality seed continues to be one  of the greatest impediments to bridging the vast yield gap. Therefore, to  approach the potentially realizable yield of a cultivar, production and  distribution of quality seed is essential. The good quality seed should have  the following characters:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Genetic purity, and  uniformity and should conform to the standards of the particular cultivar.</li>
				  <li>Disease free, viable  seeds.</li>
				  <li>Free from admixtures of  other crop seeds, weeds and inert matter.</li>
				  <li>Acceptable uniformity with  respect to size, shape and color.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>                      <br />
				  <strong>Seed Production </strong> <br />
  <strong>          </strong>Systemized  crop production is known as seed production. In seed production adequate care  is given from the purchase of seeds upto harvest adopting proper seed and crop  management techniques.<br />
				  The benefits of  seed production are</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Higher  income</li>
				  <li>Higher  quality seed for next sowing</li>
			    </ul>

				<p>SCOPE AND IMPORTANCE OF SEED PRODUCTION </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>          </strong>Indian Agriculture has made enormous progress in the last  50 years. Food grains production has risen from 50 million tons in 1947 to 212  million tons in 2003-04. The country has advanced from a situation of food  scarcity and imports to that of food security and exportable surpluses. The Green Revolution of India has been universally acclaimed  as a successful enterprise of the farmers, the Scientists and the Government.  The land mark achievements in agriculture in the 60s and 70s were the result of  a combination of inputs like introduction of high yielding varieties, increased  fertilizer use, expansion of irrigation facilities, massive extension efforts,  improved farm practices and, above all, ingenuity and industry of the Indian  farmers. However, the growth of agriculture sector has not kept pace with the  growth of the population and has stagnated. The unsatisfactory growth of  agriculture, apart from serious implications for food security of the country,  has been adversely impacting the growth rate of country’s economy. The  imperative of National food security, nutritional security and economic  development demand a very focused and determined approach to raise productivity  and production in agriculture. In view of the fact, that the area under cultivation  is unlikely to increase significantly, thrust will have to be on raising productivity per unit of cultivated  land. <br />
				  <br />
				  Substantial  increase in yield and quality of crops depends upon a number of factors viz.,  inputs like fertilizers, irrigation and plant protection measures and suitable  agronomic practices.           However,  the use of high quality seed thus plays a pivotal role in the crop production.  The use of poor quality seeds nullifies the utility of all agronomic practices  and every other input applied to the crop no matter how lavishly they are  applied. Economically, the cost of seed is a very small component of the total  cost of production.  Sindhur Sen (1974)  summarizes the importance of seed quality thus “What are known as the seeds of  hope may turn into seeds of frustration” if they are not of high quality. It is  therefore, important to use the seed confirming to the prescribed standards in  terms of high genetic purity, physical purity, physiological quality and health  quality. Since ages, Indian farmers were mostly dependent on traditional  varieties, therefore seed requirements were met through farm saved seeds. The  use of traditional varieties coupled with farm saved seeds whose quality is not  guaranteed, resulted in drastic reduction in production. </p>
				<p>          Seed is the critical  determinant of agricultural production on which depends the performance and  efficacy of other inputs. Quality  seeds appropriate to different agro-climatic conditions and in sufficient  quantity at affordable prices are required to raise productivity. Availability  and use of quality seeds is not a onetime affair. Sustained increase in  agriculture production and productivity necessarily requires continuous  development of new and improved varieties of crops and efficient system of production  and supply of seeds to farmers.<br />
				  The  National Seeds Policy 2002<strong> </strong>clearly  emphasizes that “It has become  evident that in order to achieve the food production targets of the future, a  major effort will be required to enhance the seed replacement rates of various  crops. This would require a major increase in the production of quality seeds……..” According  to the National seeds Policy 2002, the thrust areas have to be -<br />
				  i) Varietal Development.<br />
				  ii) Seed Production.<br />
				  iii) Seed Replacement Rate Enhancement.<br />
				  iv) Primary responsibility for production of breeder seed to be that  of the ICAR/State Agriculture Universities.<br />
				  v) An effective seed production programme.<br />
				  vi) Popularization of new varieties.<br />
				  vii) Availability of newly developed varieties to farmers with  minimum time gap.<br />
				  viii) Provision of incentives to domestic seed industry to enable it  to produce seeds of high yielding varieties and hybrid seeds at a faster pace  to meet the challenges of domestic requirements. </p>
				<p>          After the genesis of NSP, NSE &amp;  SSC and private seed companies, production of certified and foundation seeds  have been undertaken by them.</p>

				<p>          The  Indian seed industry is the eighth largest in the world with an estimated value  of INR 49 billion (USD 1.06 Billion) and with an annual growth rate of 12% to  13 %. The industry has shown a buoyant growth over the last two years on well  supportive monsoons. The development of private seed industry is no more  confined to just production and marketing of seed. It has well acquired  technological strength to cater to the varietal needs of tomorrow. Along with  industries Indian farmers have in recent years adopted intensive cultivation  practices in order to meet the growing demand for agricultural produce. </p>
				<p>          India is bestowed with varied agro  climatic conditions / zones, experienced and dedicated farmers, viable seed  industry, legislations etc favouring the production of quality seeds. However,  there is an urgent need for streamlining all our strengths to overpower the  weaknesses. </p>
				<p><strong>Strengths </strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>A well developed and  knitted seed multiplication and distribution systems linked with several ICAR  institutes / SAUs / NSC / SFCI etc.</li>
				  <li>A network of 20 seed  certification agencies and more than 96 notified seed testing laboratories to  legally assure the quality seeds moving in the seed market.</li>
				  <li>A large number of  varieties in different vegetable crops are available suited to varied agro  climatic conditions. This makes the selection easier for taking up production  in a particular area.</li>
				  <li>Our county is bestowed  with varied agro climatic conditions, which can be exploited for taking up seed  production of vegetables at any time of the year in one or other past of the  country.</li>
				  <li>A very fast development of  private seed companies which are helpful in bridging. The gap between demand  and supply of vegetable seeds in the country.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Weaknesses </strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Vegetable seed production  in the country has been vulnerable to vagaries of weather resulting in  production of poor quality seeds. </li>
				  <li>Availability of realistic  data on actual area under vegetable and requirements of vegetable seeds is  inappropriate.</li>
				  <li>Maintenance of isolation  distance. Since in our system there is no restriction for planting any  particular vegetable crops in any particular area, it becomes difficult many  times to maintain the recommended isolation distance.</li>
				  <li>Very low or no indents for  new improved varieties due to ignorance about the performance of newly  developed improved varieties.</li>
				  <li>Non-availability of  adequate nucleus and breeder seeds in the seed production chain.</li>
				  <li>Problems in lifting  produced seeds against indents. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Factors which affect  demand </strong><br />
                    <strong>          </strong>It is important to  distinguish between actual demand, perceived demand and what the government  expects the farmers to buy. The total amount of certified or labelled seed sold  may be quite a small proportion of the total requirement. </p>
				<p>          Many factors have to be considered  while assessing and forecasting demand. Some of these are:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Cropping pattern and  intensity</li>
				  <li>Type of seed used</li>
				  <li>Climate</li>
				  <li>Demand for crop products</li>
				  <li>Market scenario</li>
				  <li>Disposable farm income</li>
				  <li>Rate or level of adoption  of new technology</li>
				  <li>Government policy</li>
				  <li>Crop cycles</li>
				  <li>Habits and tradition</li>
				  <li>Product performance</li>
				  <li>Competitiveness</li>
				  <li>Price </li>
				  <li>Promotion </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>The most important factors that need to be taken into  account when an individual company or organization is estimating the market  share that may be gained by its own products are product performance,  competitive positioning, price and promotion. This will form the basis of sales  forecasting and production planning. </p>
				<h1>Demand  Forecasting of seed</h1>
				<p>          In adequate estimation of demand and  the consequences of over production or under production can cause serious  financial consequences for a seed company. Too many carryovers and stock  write-offs will prove to be expensive, while lack of seed means a loss of  revenue and a source of frustration for the sales force and the dealer network.  This combination of special features in the seed industry makes the accurate  assessment of demand even more critical. Some of these features are</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Longer period of time for  the development new products from breeding programmes</li>
				  <li>Seasonality of production</li>
				  <li>Production subject to  variables like agro climatic conditions outside the control of management</li>
				  <li>Statutory controls and  quality standards</li>
				  <li>Existence of a generation  system – where by the production in one year is the progenitor the next</li>
				  <li>Limited shelf like and  loss of germination</li>
				  <li>Seed replacement rate:  Seed Replacement Rate is the rate at which the farmers replace the seeds  instead of using their own seeds</li>
			    </ul>

				<p><em>Source: Narrative notes on Plan  Programme-2005-06, S.P.C, ,Chennai.</em></p>
				<p>In demand forecasting the first step is to calculate  the existing requirement multiplied by percent bought seed, which is the amount  of commercial seed purchased by farmers. In calculating seed requirement, seed  multiplication rates must be taken into account.<strong> </strong>Seed Multiplication  Ratio is the ratio at which the seed multiplies.</p>
				<p>In the present Indian scenario, seed production can be  taken up as a small-scale industry or it can be taken up as under contract for  the other seed companies. In either way, seed production has huge potential to  ensure better returns.</p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p align="center"><strong>SCOPE  FOR SEEDS EXPORT</strong></p>
				<p><strong>          </strong>There  is lot of scope for marketing of seed by Indian seed companies in countries  lying between 300 North and South latitudes, which are having  similar agro-climatic situations and the varieties bred in India are suitable  as well as comparable to varieties produced in European Union (EU), USA and  Japan etc. In addition, wage rates and consumption pattern of those areas are  comparable to Indian conditions. The seed can be exported from India to  Indonesia, Bangladesh, China, Sri Lanka, African countries. Central and South  America and markets in developed countries. The Indian cotton hybrids are  suitable for African countries, where the wage rates are low for hand picking  in indeterminate types. The hybrid seeds of paddy, cotton, maize, sorghum,  pearl millet, sunflower, varietal seeds of paddy, vegetables (tomato, brinjal,  gourds and bhendi) can be produced more economically in AP for export purposes. </p>
				<p><strong>Export  opportunities </strong><br />
                    <strong>          </strong>The  export opportunities can be classified into two major categories. </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Custom production of  vegetable seeds (including hybrid vegetables)</li>
				  <li>Export of branded seeds </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>i.  Custom production of vegetable seeds (including hybrid vegetables)</strong><br />
				  Hybrid vegetable seed production is  highly labour intensive. As the competition is going up, most of the major  global companies are outsourcing the seed production to the countries having  labour cost advantage <em>viz., </em>China, Thailand, Vietnam, Chile, India etc.  several Indian companies have established good reputation over the past 10  years by supplying good quality seed under contract production. We also have  experienced and skilled manpower to take up this activity on large scale. If  we look at the production capacity 70% of India’s seeds’ sales come from farmer  bred seeds, 26% from those bred in publicly financed institutions, and only 4%  from researched hybrids. The domestic hybrid seeds market is placed at INR 4.9  Billion and is annually growing at 10% a year, against the 5% global growth  rate.</p>
				<p><strong>ii.  Export of branded seeds </strong><br />
                    <strong>          </strong>Over  the last 15-20 years, Indian seed industry has emerged as a vibrant research  based industry (in vegetable as well as field crops). Several innovative  superior products have been developed for widely varying agro-climatic  conditions in the Indian agriculture. It is reported that Indian germplasm /  seeds can adopt very well in the countries failing in the region 300  North and South on the equator. This would cover markets of several developing  countries from Central / South America, Africa and Asia. Incidentally, both  Africa and Asia are presently the fastest growing markets. Indian seed sector  with its vast germplasm base and trained man power would become a strong  technology source for such countries.  </p>
				<p><strong>Agri  –export zones</strong><br />
                    <strong>          </strong>India  has her own inherent strength in agriculture and agriculture exports. Now these  have been strengthened with the liberalization, privatization polices of the  government and the positive clauses in the World Trade Agreement with which India  can poise to double its agro exports to Rs.200 billion by 2007.</p>
				<p>          With a view to promoting agricultural  exports from the country and remunerative returns to the farming community in a  sustained manner, the concept of Agri Export Zones (AEZ) was floated. These  zones have been set up for end-to-end development for export of specific  products from a geographically contiguous area. </p>
