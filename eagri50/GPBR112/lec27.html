				<p>The process of elimination of moisture from the  seed is called drying. Seed drying should reduce the seed moisture content to  safe moisture limits to maintain its viability and vigour during storage, which  may otherwise deteriorate quickly owing to mold growth, heating and enhanced  microbial activity. Seed drying also permits early harvesting, long term  storage of seeds, more efficient use of land and manpower, the use of plant  stalks as green fodder and production of high quality seed.<br />
          Depending  upon the climate and method of harvesting adopted the threshed seed may or may  not be dry enough for safe storage. Under less favorable conditions, threshed  seed needs further drying. <br />
<strong>Stage  of moisture elimination</strong><br />
          The  moisture from the seed is eliminated in 2 stages</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Surface  moisture of the seed that initially removed by the drying air.</li>
				  <li>The  removal of the moisture in the surface cause an imbalance in the moisture  potential in the surface of the seed and the inner portion of the seed which  leads to the migration of moisture from the inner organ to the surface.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>The migration of moisture to the surface is slower  than the evaporation and a moisture gradient is developed in the kernal.<br />
				  Elimination  of moisture from the seed depends upon the relative humidity and temperature of  the environment surrounding the seed.   When RH of the atmosphere is less than the seed, moisture is eliminated  from the seed.  While drying, care should  be taken to minimize /prevent oxidation and decomposition and  volatilization.  In this process there  will be loss of dry weight of seed which is widened when the processes take  place at high temperature.  Hence, high  moisture seeds should be dried at low temperature.</p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Equilibrium  moisture content</strong><br />
				  A  seed is in equilibrium with the environment when the rate of moisture loss from  the seed to the surrounding atmosphere is equal to the rate of moisture gained  by the seed from the atmosphere.<br />
  <strong>Drying  temperature</strong><br />
				  Greater  the seed moisture content lesser should be the drying temperature and vice  versa.<br />
				  10%              MC and below                110 o  F   (43.3o C)<br />
				  10-18 %       MC                                 100 o  F   (42.2 o C)<br />
				  18-30 %       MC                                   90 o  F   (32.2 o F)<br />
				  The rate of drying depends on</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Initial  seed moisture content</li>
				  <li>Size  of the bin and capacity</li>
				  <li>Depth  of spread of seed</li>
				  <li>The  rate of air blow</li>
				  <li>Atmosphere  air temperature and relative humidity</li>
				  <li>Static  pressure</li>
				  <li>Drying  temperature</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Methods  of drying</strong><br />
				  I. Physical drying (or) natural drying (or) traditional  sun drying<br />
				  II. Mechanical (or) artificial drying</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Drying  with forced natural air</li>
				  <li>Drying  with forced artificially heated air</li>
				  <li>Drying  with desiccants</li>
				  <li>Drying  with infrared rays</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>I. Physical drying / Natural  drying / Traditional Sun drying</strong><br />
				  This is the common conventional method in which  drying of the harvested crop is carried out in the field or threshing floor by  the radiant energy of the sun.  This does  not involve any expenditure.  To achieve  uniform drying, the seed should be spread in thin layer.  High moisture content seed with a moisture  content of more than 17% should be dried first under  shade  / light to reduce the moisture content less  than 17% and then dried under heavy sun i.e. noon drying.  Sun dried seeds should not be allowed to  remain open in the floor during night, since seed will absorb moisture from  air.  2-4 days are needed to reduce the  moisture content to 10-12%. Direct sunlight also can adversely affect seed  germinability owing to high temperature and ultraviolet radiation, especially  if the moisture content of the seed is high.<br />
  <strong>Advantages</strong><br />
				  1. Easy and cheap<br />
				  2. Does not require any expenditure or fuel.<br />
  <strong>Disadvantages</strong><br />
				  1. The rate of drying is slow<br />
				  2. Loss due to attack by insects, birds and animals<br />
				  3. Large floor area is required<br />
				  4. Involves extra labour for collecting and exposing  during the day<br />
				  5. Sun drying cause sun checks or hot spots due to  variation in temperature from time to time. This checks or spots induce high  amount of breakage while processing<br />
				  6. mechanical admixtures are possible<br />
				  7. Dust, dirt and other foreign materials get  admixed<br />
				  8. High weather risks and damage by heavy wind and  rains<br />
  <strong>II. Mechanical drying or  artificial drying</strong><br />
  <strong>Forced air drying</strong> <br />
				  In  forced air drying, natural air or air supplemented with heat is blown through a  layer of seed until drying is completed. <br />
				  Generally  ordinary seed godowns are provided with two types of ventilators for free  movement of air circulation.  In modern  godowns, provisions are to be made for forcible circulation of air with the  help of an electronic blower.  The  outside air which is comparatively dry is circulated in the godown and thereby  the seed get dried up in this process.   This is possible only in dry months. <br />
				  Two types of driers are used: batch and continuous  flow driers.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Batch dryers</strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p>         In  batch drier, relatively dry air is blown through a layer of seed until the seed  is dried completely, after which it is removed and replaced by another batch of  seed. The method is simple and well suited to small quantities of seed, allows  easy cleaning and is recommended for farm drying. <br />
				  In  horizontal drier, the seed is contained in a box or chamber with a perforated  floor through which the air is blown. Air ducts can be installed in a barn  floor and the seed to be dried piled over them. <br />
				  In a  modified sack drier, seed contained in a woven sack is placed on a grid through  which air is blown. A cylindrical storage bin with raised perforated floor  arranged to blow air underneath the floor can also be used. <br />
				  A  vertical batch drier consists of two concentric perforated cylinders. The space  between the two cylinders is filled with seed and air is blown into the inner  cylinder from where it passes outward the seed. The size of the batch  determines the drying rate.<br />
				  In  horizontal batch drier, the seed at the bottom dries first, with the dry zone  extending gradually upward. The drying of the uppermost seed may be delayed  unduly if the seed layer is too thick or the airflow is inadequate. The seed  layer should not exceed a depth of 3m and for high moisture forage seed, it  should be reduced to 1m or less. If the seed is dried in a storage bin, a layer  of undried seed can be added on top of the dried batch and drying continued,  but only if the seed is already fairly dry and air is not too hot. Seed loss  also can be avoided by drying in two stages. After the first batch has  partially dried, the emerging air is passed through a second batch held in  another chamber, repeating the process with second batch and so on. <br />
				  The  air blown through a batch must not be too hot, because the seed at the bottom  may be overheated by direct exposure to the entering hot air. It is often not  necessary to heat the air at all, and heating to less than 10o C  above the ambient temperature can be very effective, but on a hot humid day in  the tropics even a few degrees above ambient temperature can harm the seeds.  Dehumidifiers may need to be used under these circumstances.<br />
				  An  appropriate drying rate is very important. Too rapid drying may harm the seed  because of the high drying temperature or a quick loss of water from the seed.  Slow drying may mean maintaining a high moisture seed at a higher temperature  for a prolonged time, resulting in deterioration of seed.<br />
  <strong>2)</strong> <strong>Continuous  flow dryers</strong><br />
  <strong>          </strong>In  this type of drier, the seed moves horizontally or vertically through a stream  of hot air and then into a cooling chamber. These driers are however difficult  to clean when there is a change of cultivar. These driers can use air  temperature higher than those of batch dries, because the seed is heated for a  much shorter time.<br />
  <strong>i) L.S.U. dryers (Louisiana  State University dryers)</strong> <br />
				  This  is a continuous column heated air drier largely used for paddy.  The paddy seeds are fed from the top with the  help of gravity force in zig zag manner and heated air is blown from the bottom  usually at right angles to the direction of seed motion. The falling seeds get  dried up by the heated air and this process is repeated till to get a reduction  of moisture content to the expected level.<br />
  <strong>ii) Non mixing column dryer</strong><br />
				  These  dryers consist of a tall vertical column through which paddy flows by  gravity.  No provision is made for  agitating the paddy as it flows and hence there is no attempt to drive the  paddy from a straight path.  Paddy  descends gradually between two parallel screens and heated air is forced  through the screens.<br />
  <strong>Advantages over bin dryers</strong><br />
				  1. Short drying period<br />
				  2. Less damages or spoilage during wet weather<br />
				  3. Drying is more uniform.<br />
  <strong>Advantages of mechanical  drying</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Quick  method, timely and uniform drying is possible</li>
				  <li>Makes  early harvest possible</li>
				  <li>It  reduces the chances of losses due to over ripening and shattering of seed</li>
				  <li>Losses  due to rodents and birds are prevented.</li>
				  <li>Less  damage during processing operation.</li>
				  <li>Permits  long time storage by preventing sun checks and other damages.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Initial  cost of drying the equipment is high</li>
				  <li>Fuel  is expensive</li>
				  <li>It  produces possible fire hazards</li>
				  <li>Considerable  supervision is necessary.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Storage  structures for Seed drying</strong><br />
                    <strong>         </strong>Building requirements for a seed drying system  depend upon the size of operation, the number of different seeds to be dried,  the level of mechanization desired and future expansion. Different types and  forms of storage structures can be built for handling seeds to be dried with  forced air. These may be made of steel, wood, plywood or concrete and they may  be cylindrical or rectangular in shape.<br />
				  Regardless of the type of structure, all storage  bins used for forced air drying in storage of seeds must have the following  features.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Small  grain seeds in bulk exert large pressures against the sidewalls. The side pressures  are converted to a vertical load on the foundation, which should be strong  enough to hold the seed lots.</li>
				  <li>The  roof and walls of bins must be airtight for drying to proceed satisfactorily.</li>
				  <li>The  openings for filling and removal of seed should be large and convenient to use.  A full size entrance door is desirable.</li>
				  <li>A  hand space about 1 m should be provided for easy inspection of seed. Cleaning  and spraying operations should be convenient. For fumigation, the structures  should be airtight, with a provision for temporary sealing of all openings. </li>
				  <li>The  structure should be able to dry and store more than one kind of seed. </li>
				  <li>The  dryingair should be uniformly distributed through all portions of the seed lot  for efficient drying.</li>
				  <li>Theflow  of air leaving the seed should proceed rapidly so that back pressures do not  hinder the flow of drying into the seed.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Air-Distribution Systems</strong><br />
				  Agrawal described three types of air-distribution  systems used for seed drying.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The  main and lateral duct system b) a single central perforated duct and c) the  perforated false floor system.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>          Multiple  bin storage structures for drying can be built so that they are arranged to  enable the drying of several seed lots simultaneously using the same drying  fans. Alternatively, different seed lots can be dried successively with sliding  air gates controlling the flow of air to the respective bins. A multiple bin  arrangement is particularly useful to dry more than one kind of seed  simultaneously.<br />
                    <strong>Heated air drying system</strong><br />
				  Heated air driers consist of (a) a  heater unit where fuel is burned and (b) a<br />
				  fan  to force the heated air through a canvas connecting duct into the air  distribution system of the drying bin. Safety features such as automatic  thermostatic high limit temperature control, which cuts off the burner flame if  the air temperature exceeds a certain safe maximum and flame failure control,  which automatically cuts off fuel flow to the burner if the flame goes out are  provided. A thermostat can also automatically maintain the air temperature at a  desired setting. In many driers, such thermostats are provided as a standard  feature.<br />
				  Two  main types of driers are available, which differ in the manner heat is supplied  to the air. Direct fired and indirect fired. In a direct fired drier, the fuel  is burned and the hot combustion gases are thrown directly into the air  distribution system. Although the heat is used very efficiently, there is  possibility of blowing soot, unburned fuel and objectionable fumes into the  seed. The burner, therefore, needs to be adjusted properly to burn the fuel  completely. With certain fuels, there is also a danger of blowing small sparks  into the seed.<br />
				  In indirect fired driers, the hot  combustion gases pass into a chamber. The drying air circulates around this  chamber and picks up heat as in a hot air furnace. The drying air thus does not  include combustion gases, sparks, soot or fumes. These driers are less  efficient in the use of heat, but are safer than direct fired types.<br />
				  The driers are designed to burn  various types of fuels (eg. liquid propane or butane, natural gas, fuel oil and  coal. Both liquid propane and natural gas burn readily with minimum soot and  are the best fuels for direct driers and kerosene oil is better for indirect  fired driers.<br />
				  Two important aspects that must be  considered while calculating the requirements of a suitable to crop drier are  the required air flow volume and the heat capacity (BTU/hr) for drying seeds at  the specified desired rate. The fan requirements can be computed by knowing the  total air flow at the static pressure of the seed at a given drying depth and  heater requirement are estimated by calculating the amount of water to be  removed from the seed per hour. Based on these calculations, a suitable crop  drier can be selected to provide a minimum required airflow volume(bin capacity  x air flow rate) and heat capacity in BTU/hr. Agrawal categorized types of  heated driers as layer-in -bin, batch-in-bin, batch and continuous driers and  described their functions.<br />
				  Stirring devices keep the seed in a  loose fill condition, allowing easy airflow through the bottom layers. Such  mechanisms alleviate the problems of uneven drying (or over drying) by breaking  up pockets of fires and trash and blending the seed by constant mixing.<br />
				  Large differences in the degree of  drying between the top and bottom layers of seed have been noticed during  drying by heated air. It is therefore, advisable to dry seed at shallow depths  to minimize these differences and avoid overheating of the bottom layer.  Agrawal recommended maximum seed depths and temperatures for batch drying of  seeds of different crop species in bins.</p>

				<p>          Heated air drying requires higher  rates of airflow, because water is evaporated faster and more air is needed to  carry it away. The higher air flow rate also ensures more uniform drying of the  top and bottom layers of the seed, completing the drying much faster at the  recommended temperatures.<br />
				  The general procedure for bin drying  of seeds with heated air consists of charging seed into the bin to the  recommended depth. The drier is operated at the recommended temperature of the  seed using either manual or thermostatic controls to set the desired  temperature. After drying is completed, blowing of the air through the seed is  continued for sometime without heat to bring the seed to an ambient  temperature. <br />
				  Some variations of batch drying with  heated air include wagon drying, bag drying and box drying. In wagon drying,  the seed is loaded directly onto a wagon especially constructed for drying. The  wagon is then drawn to the drier unit and connected with a canvas distribution  duct. Forcing the air up through the perforations in the wagon floor dries the  seed. After drying, the wagon is disconnected from the canvas duct and the seed  is cooled with a fan towed to the storage bins. Wagon drying provides  continuous drying, vwrsatality, easy cleaning and low initial cost.<br />
				  Bag drying is another suitable  variation to handle several varieties of smaller quantities of seed  simultaneously. Seed received in jute bags is exposed to airflow with minimum  static pressure, because the drying bed is only one sack deep. Typical design  criteria provide 25 - 40m3 of air/min/m3 seed at a static  pressure of 3cm less. The construction is simple and inexpensive.<br />
				  A box drier is modified bag drier well  adopted to dry smaller quantities of basic or foundation seed. With box driers,  it is possible to maintain the identity of small seed lots despite handling.  The boxes can be constructed of locally available materials,  which are fitted with perforated metal or woven wire bottoms. <br />
  <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempering">Tempering</a></strong><br />
				  Seed  is usually dried in stages with heated air each stage consisting of a pass  through the drier.  Between passes the  seed is stored in bins for an equilibrium period known as tempering  period.  This period of tempering  shortens the total drying time.  During  drying, surface moisture is removed and internal moisture moves towards the  surface are slower than evaporation, and a moisture gradient develops in the  kernel.  The outside becomes drier than  the inside and evaporation rate decreased.   During tempering moisture concentration equalizes in the kernel and then  evaporation of surface moisture is nearly as rapid as at the start of drying.</p>
