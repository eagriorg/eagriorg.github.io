				<p>Crossing  technique             :       Manual emasculation by detasseling</p>
				<p>Detasseling                        :       Removal of male inflorescence from the monoecious crop </p>
				<p>Time for detasseling           :   The time taken for shedding of pollen from the  tassel in 1-2 days after emergence. Hence the tassel should be removed before  the shedding of pollen. </p>
				<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detasseling">Detasseling</a>         </strong><br />
				  Detasseling is the removal of tassel  from female parent. Detasseling is done when the tassel emerged out of the boot  leaf, but before anthesis have shed pollen. Anthers take 2-4 days to dehisce  after complete emergence. Only in few cases, the anthers start dehisce before  its complete emergence. In such case detasseling should be done earlier.  Detasseling is done every day from the emergence of tassel upto 14 days.<br />
  <strong>Method</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Hold  the stem below the boot leaf in left hand and the base of the basal in right  hand and pull it out in a single pull. </li>
				  <li>Grasp  entire tassel so that all the pollen parts are fully removed.</li>
				  <li>Do  not break or remove leaves as removal will reduce yields and will result in  lower quality of seed.<strong> </strong></li>
			    </ul>

				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Precautions  to be adopted during detasseling</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>No part  should be left on the plant as it causes contamination. </li>
				  <li>It  should be uniform process done daily in the morning in a particular direction. </li>
				  <li>Donot  break the top leaves as the field may be reduced due to the earning of source  material to accumulate in sink [seed ] as removal of 1 leaf course 1.5% loss 2  leaves 5.9% loss and 3 leaves 14% loss in yield. </li>
				  <li>Detassel  only after the entire tassel has come out and immature detasseling may lead to  reduced yield and contamination. </li>
				  <li>Mark the  male rows with marker to avoid mistake in detasseling </li>
				  <li>Look out  for shedders [shedding tassel] in female rows as the may cause contamination. </li>
				  <li>After  pulling out the tassel drop it there itself and bury in soil. Otherwise late  emerging pollen from detasseled tassel may cause contamination. </li>
				  <li>Do not  carry the tassel through the field as any fall of pollen may lead to  contamination. </li>
				  <li>Donot  practice, improper, immature and incomplete detasseling. </li>
				  <li><strong>Improper detasseling</strong>: A  portion of the tassel is remaining in the plant while detasseling. <strong></strong></li>
				  <li><strong>Immature detasseling: </strong>Carrying  out detasseling work when the tassel is within the leaves.<strong></strong></li>
				  <li><strong>Incomplete detasseling</strong>: The  tassel is remaining in lower or unseen or unaccounted in within the whole of  leaves. <strong></strong></li>
				  <li>There  should not be any shedding tassel.<strong></strong></li>
				  <li><strong>Shedding tassel</strong>: Either full or  part of tassel remain in female line after detasseling and shedding pollen which  may contaminate the genetic purity of the crop. <strong></strong></li>

				<p><strong>Types of  hybrids</strong>   <br />
                    <strong>Single  cross hybrid </strong><br />
                    <strong>          </strong>It  is a cross between 2 inbreds. A x B. A genotype will be detasseled and crossed  with B genotypes.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>COH 1- UMI 29 x UMI 51</li>
				  <li>COH 2- UMI 810 x UMI 90</li>
				  <li>CoH(M) 5-UMI 285 X UMI 61</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Double cross</strong> </p>
				<ul>
				  <li> It is a cross between two single crosses.</li>
				  <li> It is a cross between 2 hybrids (A x B) x (C x  D) (A x B) single cross hybrid will be produced by detasseling A and by  crossing with B (C x D) hybrid will be produced by detasseling C and crossing  with D. </li>
				  <li>Then (A  x B) will be detasseled and crossed with (C x D) hybrid. </li>
			    </ul>

				  COH3 : ( UMI 101 x UMI 130 ) x (UMI 90 x UMI 285 )</p>
				<p><strong>Three  way cross</strong> </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>				    It is a  cross between a single cross and an inbred. </li>
				  <li>				    It is  first generation resulting from the crossing of on approved inbred line and a  certified open pollinated variety A x variety)</li>
				  <li>A will be detasseled and allowed for  crossing in the variety.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Example                       Ganga -5       (CM 202 x CM 111) x CM 500.<br />
				  COH (M) 4   :  (UMI 90 x UMI 285)  x    UMI  112</p>

				<p><strong>Production of  Synthetic cultivars</strong><br />
				  Breeding  of cereal and other agronomic crops has contributed significantly to the growth  of agribusiness worldwide.   In normally self fertilized crops, new  variability may be created by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridisation">hybridisation</a>, followed  by the selection of desired cultivars in which desirable characteristics from  two or more parents are combined. The type of hybrid cultivar obtained will  depend upon the genetic background of the chosen parents as well on the method  of selection used. A similar situation arises when new variability is  artificially induced through mutations. <br />
				  In  pure-line theory of classic plant breeding, a pure line is defined as all the  descendants of single homozygous individual by continued self-fertilization,  resulting in a homogeneous cultivar. Hybridization, however, results in  significant heterogenity. The multiplication of such heterogenous progeny in  bulk to select homozygous individuals would be gigantic task. Most modern  hybrid cultivars are, therefore, selected at an early stage (F2) as  subsequent lines and probably released at the F8 and F12 generations.  These are obviously not as homogeneous as a pure line. <br />
				  Cultivars  can also be selected by producing multilines. Whereas normal line selection  seeks to produce a new cultivar on the basis of one line or a few lines that  are very similar, multiline cultivars are essentially different from each other  in their characteristics, such as resistance to pests and diseases or  environmental stresses. Thus, by incorporating different sources of resistance,  the newly synthesized cultivar is buffered against changes brought about by  virulent pathognes. These cultivars are however, not very stable compared to  those produced by the conventional methods of selection. A change in the  prevalence of a virulent pathogen may eliminate certain lines from the  cultivar. It is, therefore, necessary to return the cultivar to the plant  breeder for its reconstitution. This may be advantageous, because it enables  plant breeders to substitute new sources of resistance in the material.<br />
				  Alternatively,  the plant breeder can create a composite cross by bulking the F2  generations of several crosses. The composite is allowed to develop for several  generations during which natural selection may occur. If the composite is grown  at more than one location, a locally adapted cultivar may be developed in time.  The   <br />
				  composite constitutes a gene pool from which the plant  breeder can select a cultivar with desirable characteristics for further  multiplication.<br />
				  An  alternative to the composite is the synthetic or artificial method of plant <br />
				  breeding in which a number of lines are put together by  the plant breeder in predetermined proportions. A synthetic line generally has  a limited life, because the proportions of the constituent lines are likely to  change over number of generations. The plant breeder must plan for seed  production of limited generation basis. This system can be extended by using  mixtures of cultivars claimed to be advantageous in some species over a single  cultivar, especially if different resistant genes are present in each cultivar.  This method adds to the cost of mixing, which can be reduced by growing a seed  crop for one or two generations after mixing before using it for crop  production.<br />
				  A hybrid  cultivar results from a controlled cross between a male and female parent, the  seed being harvested from female parent only and used for crop production.<br />
				  In self  fertilized crop species, it is easy to produce hybrid cultivars if male sterile  lines are available that can be used as female parents. There are certain  substsnces that act as a gametocides, destroying the pollen of desired female  parent, or as inhibitors that prevent pollen produced by the female parent from  effecting fertilization. The advantage of the synthetic hybrid cultivar lies in  heterosis. Special expensive measures are required to produce seed that is  harvested from the female parent only. The resultant heterosis therefore must  have a profitable effect to compensate for the cost of production of synthetic  hybrid cultivars in the self pollinating crop species.<br />
				  In the  cross pollinated crop species, plant breeders look for parent plants that have  good combining ability. These plants, when allowed to multiply together,  produce a desirable combination of characteristics. Cross fertilization results  in greater heterozygosity in these plants than in the self fertilized plants  and therefore less homogeneity. Each generation of an open pollinated cultivar  is thus a mixture of hybrids. The open pollinated cultivars are generally grown  for a limited number of generations and returned to the plant breeder’s  maintenance material after each cycle of seed production to produce commercial  quantities of seeds. <br />
				  Putting  together a large number of parent plants and allowing random pollination to  occur can create composites. A composite in a cross fertilized species is  generally the product of the first generation of such random pollination.<br />
				  Production  of synthetic cultivars begins with a limited number of specific parents, which  are permitted to interpollinate. The number of generations of multiplication is  strictly limited so as to recreate the synthetic/artificial cultivar at the end  of each multiplication cycle. As with the self fertilized species, synthetic  hybrid cultivars of cross fertilized species are created by controlling pollination  to ensure that seed is produced from a desired crossing. This can be achieved  by the following methods.<br />
				  1) By emasculating  the female parent, as is done in monoecious plants like maize, by removing the  male flowers before the release of pollens. <br />
				  2) By using <a href="http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CB0QFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.public.iastate.edu%2F~mbhattac%2Fbhattacharyya%2FMALE%2520STERILITY.pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;q=male%20sterility%20in%20plants&amp;ei=1jS1TJbmC8zIcbPboNAI&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMg6RwGLH_33_Y1HnYZVdPlfAcj">male  sterility</a> in the female line, so as to avoid the physical removal of male  flowers.   <br />
				  3) By using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-incompatibility_in_plants">self  incompatibility</a>. In this system, the seed crop is harvested as a whole,  since all plants are contributing and receiving pollen. The self  incompatibility, however, is not always complete, and there may be production  of some inbred plants. With the excessive production of such plants, the  advantage of heterosis in the subsequent crop is diminished.<br />
				  The  advantage of the synthetic hybrid cultivar in cross pollinated species is not  restricted only to heterosis. Most hybrids are based upon inbred lines.  Normally, cross fertilized plants require inbreeding for several generations to  reduce heterozygosity and to include desirable genes in synthetic cultivars. A  controlled cross between two such inbreds produces heterosis and desirable  combination of genes in the form of a synthetic cultivar.<br />
				  The major  disadvantage of the production of synthetic cultivars is the higher cost of  plant breeding and seed production, requiring considerable time consuming work  to produce desirable inbreds, which alone can be used to synthesize new  artificial hybrids. The final seed crop is not fully productive when male  sterility or emasculation is used, because only the female parent is harvested  for seed.<br />
				  Therefore  various other hybrids have been produced. The hybrid resulting from the cross  of two inbred lines is a single cross, whereas the F1 resulting from the cross  of two single cross hybrids as parents is known as a double cross. In a three  way cross, an inbred is mated with an f1 hybrid. A top cross is the F1  resulting from a cross between an inbred or a single cross and an open  pollinated cultivar. All of the forms of hybrid cultivars require a particular  cycle of seed production to produce the seed used in crop production.</p>
