				</p>
				<p>Seed  lots received from the field are often at high moisture content and contain  trash and other inert material, weed seeds, deteriorated and damaged seeds,  off-size seeds, etc. Seed processing is necessary in order to dry the seeds to safe  moisture level; remove or reduce to the extent possible the various undesirable  material, weed seeds, other crop seeds, deteriorated or damaged seeds.</p>
				<p><img src="165494" alt="" /></p>
				<p>Other  than this the seed lot heterogeneity in its physical characters like size,  colour, shape etc. The seed  lot is heterogeneous due to the following reasons</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>The  soil is heterogeneous and there is a lot of variability in the fertility status  of the soil due to the availability of nutrients, physical, chemical and  biological properties.</li>
				  <li>Variability  is introduced due to the position of seed set on the plant/fruit , time of  pollination and fertilization over a period of time</li>
				  <li>Variability  is created by biotic factors like pest and variability infestation.</li>
				  <li>Variability  is also due to the management practices like water, land preparation, leveling,  staggered sowing, and uneven distribution of fertilizer and irrigation water,  uneven plant protection sprays and uneven maturity at harvest.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>The inherent qualities such as germinability and vigour  are exemplified by certain physical characteristics of the seed i.e., large  size, a denser seed, optimum length etc.,   So, if grading is done to obtain a particular range of size, shape,  length and density of the seeds, the quality of the lot is upgraded. <br />
				  In  its common usage in India, seed processing refers to all the steps necessary  for preparation of harvested seed for marketing, namely, handling, drying,  shelling, preconditioning cleaning, size grading, treating and packaging, etc.<br />
  <strong>Seed Processing  Plant Layout Planning</strong> <br />
				  Layout plan for construction of a seed processing plant  should be carefully planned to ensure that the thorough seed cleaning,  upgrading, seed treatment and other seed processing operations are carried out  efficiently, without mixing and damaging seed lots, with a minimum of  equipment, personnel, time and at minimum cost.   The following factors should be considered in planning and designing a  seed processing plant: </p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Kinds of crop seeds to be handled and       kinds of contaminating  crop and       weed seeds usually present in the seed lots</li>
				  <li>Size of operation </li>
				  <li>Whether drying facilities should be       required </li>
				  <li>Selection of suitable equipment </li>
				  <li>Location of the plant </li>
				  <li>Source of power for running machinery </li>
				  <li>System of seed delivery to processing       plant and </li>
				  <li>Availability of labour </li>
			    </ol>
				<p>          The key to efficient plant layout is a thorough knowledge  of what needs to be done, and sound planning. First, the general sequence of  processes involved between the time seeds enter the processing plant and the  time they are cleaned, packaged and ready for shipment, must be charted.  The sequence of operations depends upon the  kind of crop and the initial quality of seed lot, type of contaminants,  moisture content of the seed lot, etc.   The layout planner must have an intimate knowledge of the seed to be  processed, its physical characteristics, the contaminants in it, and also of  the selection of machines used to bring the seed to acceptable marketing  standards.<br />
                    <strong>Seed  Processing Plant Building Layout</strong><br />
				  Seed processing plant building will comprise of following  components:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Receiving-cum-drying  platform</li>
				  <li>Processing  area</li>
				  <li>Auxiliary  building</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Receiving-cum-drying  platform</strong><br />
				  This area will be utilized to receive the raw seed and to sun dry  small lots of crop seeds. This area can also be utilized for storage of seeds  on wooden palettes. The platform will be connected to processing shed through a  rolling shutter.<br />
  <strong>Processing  area</strong><br />
				  The processing area should be situated between the shed and  ventilated storage building. The hall should be connected to ventilated flat  stores through a covered gallery for easy movement of processed and packaged  seed to seed stores. The hall should   have a big rolling shutter in the processing plant to permit entry of  seed processing equipment into the hall for installation.<br />
				  Height will be kept to facilitate installation of the seed  processing equipment and machinery. A sequence of processing machines to be  installed is shown in Fig. 1. Floor of the processing hall should be above the  ground level. <br />
				  The shed should  have sufficient provision for natural as well as forced ventilation in order to  maintain congenial atmosphere inside the shed. The shed should accommodate seed  scalping, seed processing and packaging equipment and will have sufficient  space for weighing and packaging.<br />
  <strong>Auxiliary building</strong><br />
				  In addition to building discussed  above, a provision should be  made for generator room. Sufficient length of  road should be provided to connect various  functional buildings with each other and main highway. Boundary wall should be  provided all around the complex for security reasons. Entire complex should  have a good drainage system.<br />
				  Provision for firefighting equipment  such as extinguishers, water buckets, sand buckets etc. should be made to fight  minor fire hazards. <br />
				  The processing plant building should  be constructed as per CPWD/PWD norms. It should have tubular trusses, AC sheets  pitched hole roof, cement concrete flooring finished with water-proofing cement  paint, aerated, ventilated, rat proof and bird protection. Sealed doors should  be provided in these buildings. Buildings will be suitably planned to have  interconnection for movement of seeds and materials. <br />
  <strong>Analysis of  Operation</strong> <br />
  <strong>a) Processing sequence: </strong> After the machines needed have been  identified, the next step is to determine the proper processing sequence.&nbsp;  The seed separators, elevators, conveyors and storage bins should be so  arranged that seeds flow continuously from beginning to end, and yet be  flexible enough to bypass a machine or return to a part for re-cleaning.</p>
				<p><img src="65959" /></p>
				<p><strong>b) Matching capacity:</strong> Equipment size of  capacity must be carefully planned to prevent bottlenecks.&nbsp; When the  overall operating capacity needs have been determined, all machines must be  able to handle that capacity with some reserve capacity&nbsp;for problem  lots.&nbsp; Surge bins can handle variations in individual&nbsp;machine  capacities.&nbsp; But when differences are great, either larger models, or more  than one machine installed in parallel flow, must be used to maintain  uninterrupted flow.<br />
                  <strong>c) Conveying:</strong> The type of conveying  system is also a very important factor.&nbsp; The conveying system must be able  to handle the capacity needed in a particular spot.&nbsp; And it must be  carefully adapted to the seed handled.<br />
                  <strong>Type of  Layouts</strong> <br />
There are three main types  of processing plant layouts: multistorey, single level and combination.<br />
<strong>Multistorey:</strong> In this system, seed is carried by elevators to the top floor and emptied into  large bins.&nbsp; Cleaning machines are then arranged in a vertical series on  the lower floors.&nbsp; Seed flows from one machine down into the next by  gravity.<br />
<strong>Single  level:</strong><strong> </strong>In  the single storey plant, seed is moved from&nbsp;one machine to the next by  elevators placed between the machines.&nbsp; A great advantage of the single  level system is that one man can supervise the processing line without running  up and downstairs.&nbsp; He can thus maintain closer supervision of all  operations.<br />
<strong>Combined  designs</strong>: A  compromise between the single and multistorey system could also be adapted.<br />
<strong>Planning</strong> <br />
          After the proper machines, elevator capacities, cleaning  sequences, and lay out design have been selected, detailed layout planning can  begin.&nbsp; Careful layout planning can identify and remedy bottlenecks and  trouble spots before the plant is built, and thus prevent trouble later.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the  lay out or design develops, it should be drawn on paper.&nbsp; A good method is  to draw lines of flow first and then convert these flow lines into machine  lines.&nbsp; After appropriate revisions, detailed drawings can be made to show  exact locations of equipment and distances.&nbsp; Scale drawings are the most  widely used method of layout planning.&nbsp; Scale models and scale templates  are also very effective, but are more expensive.&nbsp;</p>
				<p><img src="5959" /></p>
				<p><strong>Requirements in seed processing</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>There  should be complete separation</li>
				  <li>Minimum  seed loss</li>
				  <li>Upgrading  should be possible for any particular quality </li>
				  <li>Efficiency</li>
				  <li>It  should have only minimum requirement</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Movement of seed in a processing plant</strong></p>
				        
				<p>Handling of seed at the processing plant  adheres to a definite path irrespective of crop for easy management of seed  which is sensitive at each and every step of handling and ready to lose or gain  its quality all through the steps.</p>
				<p><img src="26595" /></p>
				<p><strong>Physical  characteristics used to separate seeds are</strong><br />
1. Size grader        :  Based on size it can be separated with air  screen                                         cleaner cum <br />
2. Length               :   Disc or indented cylinder separator<br />
3. Weight              :   Specific gravity separator  <br />
4. Shape                : Spiral separator or draper separator  for round and flat                                  seeds                            <br />
5. Surface texture :  Rough from smooth surface seed- dodder mill<br />
6. Colour               :   Electronic colour separator<br />
7. Electrical conductivity <br />
          Seed  differing in their ability to conduct electrical charge can be separated with  electronic separator.<br />
8. Affinity to liquid<br />
          The  seed coat of seed will absorb water, oils etc., which provides a means of  separating seed on the magnetic separator.<strong> </strong><br />

				<p><strong>Seed  processing equipments</strong></p>
				<h3 align="left">I. Air screen  cleaner</h3>
				<p>          This is the most important machine of  every cleaning plant. It uses screens and aspiration (air blow) for two  separations (Fig.6). A coarse upper screen removes larger material, a lower  fine screen stops the seeds and lets through fine matter and then the seed  fraction passes through a transverse or nearly vertical air stream which can  separate light impurities such as empty or partly filled seeds, husks and  glumes from the seed. In most cases a number of sieves with different sized  perforations are used and the cleaning is a process of gradually shifting out  smaller particles. Factors which determine the quality and quantity of seed cleaned  include (i) size of the perforations, (ii) the precision of the perforation,  (iii) the angle at which the sieves operate, (iv) the amplitude and speed of  movement of the sieves and (v) correct cleaning and maintenance of the  equipment. </p>
				<p><img width="520" height="438" src="lec28_clip_image002.gif" /></p>
				<p><strong>II. Cleaner  cum grader</strong><br />
          The  dried seeds should be cleaned and graded with help of a cleaner cum  grader.  For large scale cleaning and  grading the commonly available machine is the “Crippen Model Seed Cleaner cum  Grader”.<br />
<strong>It consists of  the following parts</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>A hopper in the top for seed filling</li>
				  <li>A flutted roller below the hopper to regulate the  seed flow to the screen.</li>
				  <li>Screen (or) sieves: Perforated metal sheet with  specific size of perforation in which there are two types.</li>
				  <li>Rectangular  perforations for paddy and</li>
				  <li>Round  perforations for seed other than paddy</li>
				  <li>Screen shaking unit : for oscillating the sieves to  move the seeds on the screens</li>
				  <li>Screen brushes to remove the blocked seeds</li>
				  <li>Air blower with adjustments for air outlet</li>
				  <li>Collecting outlet</li>
				  <li>Air duct for directing the blown up light particles  to outside </li>
				  <li>Collecting bins.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Working  principle</strong> <br />
				  The  seeds are fed into the hopper and they are guided to fall on the first  sieve.  The first sieve is a scalping  screen which scalps all the foreign materials larger and heavier than seed and  the entire quantity of seed passes through the first sieve. The second sieve is  a cleaning sieve which removes all the unwanted particles larger in size than  the seed. The third sieve is actually the grading sieve which size grade the  seed lot and bring into a uniform size and which also screen the undersized,  shriveled and immature seed, dust and dirt.   The seeds are then rolled and passed through air column, where they are  relived of the light chaffy and other materials by the blowing air.</p>

				<p><strong>Adjustments</strong><br />
                    <strong>Flutted roller </strong><br />
				  The speed of  this roller can be adjusted so as to increase (or) decrease the  flow of seeds to the hopper of the sieves.<br />
  <strong>Slope (or) inclination of  the screen</strong><br />
				  The  angle of inclination of the screens can be adjusted according to the nature of  seeds.<br />
  <strong>Rate of vibration of sieve</strong><br />
				  This  can be adjusted either to increase or to decrease the speed of the rolling  seeds on the screen.<br />
  <strong>Volume of air flow: </strong>By increasing (or) decreasing the air inlet.<br />
  <strong>Choice of screens: </strong>According to variety we have to change the screen<br />
  <strong>Screen dams  </strong><br />
				  Small check dams, which can be provided here and  there on the screens so that the seeds can be stopped a while and takes the  charge either to pass or to roll. <br />
  <strong>Types of seed  cleaner cum grader</strong><br />
				  I) Crippen model cleaner cum grader<br />
				  ii) Clipper model cleaner cum grader <br />
				  iii) Petkas cleaner cum grader<br />
  <strong>III. Disc  separator</strong><br />
				  It  consists of a series of discs, which revolve together on a horizontal shaft  inside the cylindrical body.  Each disc  contains many under cut pockets.  The  seed enter the intake end of the separator and move through the open centers of  the discs towards the discharge end of machine.   As the discs revolve through the seed mass the pockets lift out short  seed but rejects longer seed.  Longer  seeds are conveyed by flights on the disc spokes towards the discharge end of  the machine where they go out through the tailings gate.  The rate of seed travel through the open disc  centers is controlled by conveyor  or  blades attached to the spokes of the discs.   The disc separator makes a very precise separation.  No factor other than seed length and shape  affects its separation.  Flexibility is  obtained by varying size of the pockets.<br />
  <strong>IV. Indented  cylinder separator</strong><br />
				  The  indented cylinder separator is a rotating, almost horizontal cylinder with  movable, horizontal separating adjustments which are mounted inside it.  Indent lines are there inside the surface of  the cylinder.  The indented cylinder revolves,  turning the seed mass to give each seed a chance to fit into indent.  Short seeds are lifted out of the seed mass  and are dropped into the lifting and long seeds remain in the cylinder and are  discharged out via., a separate spout at the end of the cylinder.<br />
  <img width="245" height="318" src="lec28_clip_image004.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /><img width="218" height="340" src="lec28_clip_image006.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" />                         <br />

				  As the cylinder revolves, it creates  centrifugal force which helps to hold the seed in the indent.  Short seeds are held in the indent until the  cylinder turns to the point where the indent is inverted enough for gravity to  cause the seed to fall out of the indent.   The length, surface texture and size of seeds determine how they fit  into the indent, so that it can be lifted out of the seed mass.   The speed of the cylinder creates  centrifugal force which holds the seeds in the indent as it are lifted  upward.  Thus the shape and size of the  seed to cause some seeds to fall out after being lifted only a short distance,  while other seeds are lifted closer to the top of the cylinder before they fall  out.<br />
  <img width="234" height="259" src="lec28_clip_image008.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="12_indentcylinder" />    <img width="271" height="256" src="lec28_clip_image010.gif" /><br />
				  <strong><em>Working principle of the </em></strong><strong><em>indented  cylinder </em></strong><strong><em>separator</em></strong></p>
				<p>          As  the seeds enter the cylinder, the small, short, easy to separate seeds are  quickly removed.  The center cylinder  section removes the intermediate sizes of seeds still in the cylinder.  All indents in a cylinder are the same size,  only the progressively declining amount of material to be lifted causes this  difference in separating action.</p>
				<p><strong>Adjustments</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Cylinder  speed 2) Size of the indent 3) Trough setting 4) Tilt of the cylinder 5)  Adjustable retarder.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>V. Specific  gravity separator</strong><br />
				  Seeds  of the same size and general shape can often be separated because they differ  in specific gravity or relative weight.   This difference is very useful in removing light, immature seeds or  heavy sand and rocks to improve the purity and germination of crop seeds.<br />
  <img width="261" height="312" src="lec28_clip_image002_0000.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /><img width="236" height="324" src="lec28_clip_image004_0000.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /><strong></strong><br />
  <strong><em>           Lab Model</em></strong></p>
				<p>          If  seeds which differ in specific gravity (relative weight / unit of volume) are  placed on substrate of intermediate density, seeds of higher specific gravity  will fall down through the substrata, while seeds of lower specific gravity  will be buoyed up the substrata.  Here  air is used as separation substrata.<br />
                    <img width="282" height="234" src="lec28_clip_image006.gif" />  <img width="271" height="231" src="lec28_clip_image008.gif" /> <br />
                    <strong><em>                      Working principle  of the specific gravity separator</em></strong><strong></strong><br />
				  As  seeds flow on the deck of the gravity separator, they enter a column of air  coming up through the porous surface of the deck.  The pressure of terminal velocity of the air  rising through the deck can be controlled very closely to separate two kinds of  seeds differing in specific gravity, the air is adjusted so that only the  lighter seeds are lifted up off the deck surface.  These lighter seeds are held up by air  pressure and tend to float on the deck surface. The heavier seed possess a  velocity greater than that of the air columns so they are not lifted and so  will lie on the deck surface.  The air  column thus stratifies the seed mixture into vertical zones of relative weight  with the heavier seed lying on the deck and the lighter seeds lifted up to the  top of the seed mass.                     <br />
  <strong>Adjustments</strong><br />
				  1.  Feed rate 2) Air flow   3) End slope 4)  Side slope   5) Deck oscillation speed 6)  Deck speed.<br />
  <strong>VI. Roll mill  or dodder mill   or velvet roll mill</strong><br />
				  It  is used to separate the seeds based on surface texture and shape.  This separator should be used only after the  seed has been carefully cleaned and separated from the chaff.  These are effective in separating seeds with  a rough seed coat or shape angles from smooth seeds.<br />
  <img width="341" height="269" src="lec28_clip_image010_0000.gif" /> <br />
  <strong><em>Working principle of the  roll mill</em></strong><strong></strong></p>
				<p>          The  roll mill consists basically of two roller, covered with flannel or velvet,  placed side by side, so that they touch each other down their entire length.  The rollers are mounted on an incline and  they turn in opposite directions.  A  curved adjustable shield is mounted above the rollers.<br />
                    <strong>Separating  action</strong><br />
				  The  mixture of smooth and rough seeds is fed into the place, where the rollers  touch each other, at the high end of the machine.  As the rollers turn up and out, seeds that  are rough or have sharp or broken edges are caught by the nap of the fabric  covering the rollers.  These seeds are  thrown up against the curved shield.   They strike the shield at an angle, bounce back down to the roller and  are again thrown up against the shield.   Smooth seeds bounce down the inclined position forward between the  rollers, and discharge at the lower end of the machine.  They are not affected by the fabric roller covering,  and are not pitches over the side of the rollers.<br />
  <strong>Adjustments </strong><br />
				  1) Rate of feed 2) Speed   3) Clearance between shield and rolls  4) The angle of inclination of rolls.<br />
  <strong>VII. Magnetic  separator</strong><br />
				  The  separation is mainly based on the affinity for liquids which is used for  separation. Since seeds contains no free iron and are not attracted by a magnet  they must be selectively pretreated with a magnetic material such as finely  ground iron powder.  Rough seed coats,  cracked or broken seed coats, dirt lumps, chaff or seed with a sticky residue  on the surface will hold the liquid and become sticky, so that iron powder will  adhere to them.  Smooth coated seeds will  not absorb liquid.  So no iron powder  will adhere to them.<br />
				  The  seed are then discharged from mixing chamber and brought into contact with a  powerful magnet, which removes the iron coated seeds.  Most magnetic cleavers pass the seeds over a  revolving drum which has a high intensity magnetic field.  Seeds with an affinity for liquids which are  now coated with iron powder are attracted by the magnet and adhere to the drum  until they are removed by a brush or scraper.   Seeds which are relatively free of iron powder are not attracted by the  magnet and will fall into a separate discharge spout.<br />
  <img width="586" height="366" src="lec28_clip_image012.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="Magnetic separator" /> <br />
				  The first requisite of magnetic seed separation is  that the seed to be separated must possess different seed coat characters.  Crop seeds should have a smooth surface,  while the seeds to be removed should have a rough surface which will retain  liquid and can accept the iron powder.   Success in separating the components depends upon the magnitude of seed  coat differences and thoroughness with which the moistened seeds and the iron  powder are blended.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>VIII. Colour  separator</strong><br />
          Many  large crop seeds such as peas and beans differ in colour between  varieties.  Colour variation may also  occur due to immaturity or disease.   Electronic colour sorting machines can separate such seeds by difference  in colour and also remove mud balls and discoloured seeds in the same  operation.<br />
<img width="175" height="295" src="lec28_clip_image001.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /> </p>
				<p>          </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The electronic colour sorter views each seed  individually with photo electric cells.   The seed is compared with a selected back ground or colour range and is discharged  from the machine according to its colour.   If it is the great desired colour, the seed is discharged through the  good seed spout.  If its colour or shade  falls within the reject range, a blast of compressed air deflects the seed and  sends it in to the reject discharge spout.   These are highly sensitive. Since the machine views each seed  individually, capacity is low, but the initial cost is high and operating cost  is less.  The usefulness of machine is  greater with large seeded crops.</p>
				<h3>IX. Spiral  separator</h3>
				<p>The separator, which classifies seed according to  its shape and rolling ability, consists of sheet metal strips fitted around a  central axis in the form of a spiral. The unit resembles an open screw conveyor  standing in a vertical position. The seed is introduced at the top of the inner  spiral. Round seeds roll faster down the incline than flat or irregularly  shaped seeds, which tend to slide or tumble. <br />
                    <img width="186" height="309" src="lec28_clip_image003.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /> </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The orbit of round seed increases with speed on its  flight around the axis, until it rolls over the edge of the inner flight into  the outer flight where it is collected separately. The slower moving seed does  not build up enough speed to escape from the inner flight. Most spirals have  multiple inner flights arranged one above the other to increase the capacity.                    <br />
                    <strong>Processing equipments used for improving the quality of the seed</strong><br />
			    From  harvest upto final stage of seed storage, the seeds are to pass through various  seed proessing equipments depending upon the speciality and specificity. But  some equipment like driers and seed cleaner cum graders are common for all  types of seed. The processing machineries and equipments used in the seed  handling are as hereunder. </p>

				  Though  all the machines are highly useful in improving the seed quality, specific  machines are utilized for specific crop. The sequential usage of machineries  varies with crop seeds (Gregg, 1967). <br />
  <strong>Precautions in handling processing equipment</strong><br />
			    All  machine adjustments like the speed, oscillation and duration should be perfect.  Otherwise, it will result in mechanical damage of seed which reduces the  quality of seed in terms of vigour, viability, storability and field stand.  Drying of seed should be designed properly as the moisture content needed for threshing;  grading, treating and bagging vary with operations. Dosage, exposure period and  choice of chemical are important in mechanical seed treatment. </p>
