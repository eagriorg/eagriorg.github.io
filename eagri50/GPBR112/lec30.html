				<p>Maintenance of seed vigour and viability in terms of  germination from harvest until planting is of the utmost importance in any seed  production programme.  Care should be  taken at every stage of processing and distribution to maintain the viability  and vigour.  The harvested seeds of most  of the orthodox crop seeds are usually dried and stored for atleast one season  until the commencement of the next growing season, except those of the  recalcitrant seeds which require high moisture content for safe storage (once  dried the viability will be lost.  E.g. –  Jack, Citrus, Coffee, Cocoa, Polyalthea, etc.,).  In such recalcitrant seeds senescence starts  in the mother plant itself.  The dry  weather alters moisture content of the seed, thereby reducing the  viability.  Some seeds require an after ripening  process as in Pinus and Fraxinus.  In  most of the Agricultural crops ageing starts at physiological maturity, which  is irreversible.  Hence seeds become  practically worthless if they fail to give adequate plant stands in addition to  healthy and vigorous plants.  Good  storage is therefore a basic requirement in seed production.<br />
Purpose of seed storage<br />
          Seeds have to be stored, of course, because there is  usually a period of time between harvest and planting.  During this period, the seed have to be kept  somewhere.  While the time interval  between harvest and planting is the basic reason for storing seed, there are  other considerations, especially in the case of extended storage of seed. <br />
          The purpose of seed storage is to maintain the seed in good  physical and physiological condition from the time they are harvested until the  time they are planted. It is important to get adequate plant stands in addition  to healthy and vigorous plants. <br />
Seed suppliers are not always able to market all  the seed they produce during the following planting season.  In many cases, the unsold seed are “carried  over” in storage for marketing during the second planting season after harvest.  Problems arise in connection with carryover  storage of seed because some kinds, varieties and lots of seed do not carryover  very well.<br />
Seeds are  also deliberately stored for extended periods so as to eliminate the need to  produce the seed every season.   Foundation seed units and others have found this to be an economical,  efficient procedure for seeds of varieties for which there is limited  demand.  Some kinds of seeds are stored  for extended periods to improve the percentage and rapidity of germination by  providing enough time for a “natural” release from dormancy.       <br />
Regardless of the specific reasons for storage of  seed, the purpose remains the same maintenance of a satisfactory capacity for  germination and emergence.  The  facilities and procedures used in storage, therefore, have to be directed towards  the accomplishment of this purpose.</p>
				<h1>STAGES/SEGMENTS  OF SEED STORAGE</h1>
				<p>In the broadest sense the storage period for seed  begins with attainment of physiological maturity and ends with resumption of  active growth of the embryonic axis, i.e., germination. <br />
				  The entire storage periods can be divided into:</p>
				<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
                  <tr>
                    <td><br />

                </table>
				<p> <br />
				  Seeds are considered to be physiologically and  morphologically mature when they reach maximum dry weight.  At this stage dry-down or dehydration of the  seed is well underway.  Dry-down  continues after physiological maturity until moisture content of the seed and  fruit decreases to a level which permits effective and efficient harvest and  threshing.  This stage can be termed as  harvest maturity.  There is usually an  interval of time between physiological maturity and harvestable maturity, and  this interval represents the first segment of the storage period.  Any delay in harvesting the seed after they  reach harvest maturity prolongs the first segment of the storage period – often  to the detriment of seed quality.<br />
				  The second segment of the storage period extends  from harvest to the beginning of conditioning.   Seed in the combine, grain wagon, and bulk storage or drying bins are in  storage and their quality is affected by the same factors that affect the  quality of seed during the packaged seed segment of the storage period.      The  third segment of the storage period begins with the onset of conditioning and  ends with packaging.  The fourth segment  of the storage period is the packaged seed phase which has already been  mentioned.  The packaged seed segment is  followed by storage during distribution and marketing, and finally by storage  on the farm before and during planting.<br />
				  The seed  quality can be considerably be affected at any of the stages or segments  mentioned above unless sound principles involved in seed storage are practiced  and the seeds are properly handled.<br />
  <strong>Types of storage</strong><br />
				  The  types of storage needed can be related to the time of storage expected.  Broadly this can be classified into 4 types.</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Storage of commercial truthfully labelled and  certified seed.</li>
				  <li>Storage of carry over seeds.</li>
				  <li>Storage of foundation seed stocks and enforcement  seed samples.</li>
				  <li>Storage of germplasm seeds.</li>
			    </ol>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Storage of commercial seeds</strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>This storage of commercial  seed requires the largest storage need from harvest until planting.  The storage period ranges from 8-9  months.  Seed must be dried to 14 per  cent moisture content for starchy seed and 11 percent for oilseeds.</p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Carryover seeds</strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>About 20-25 per cent of  stored seed may have to be carried over through one season to the second  planting time.  The storage period may  range 1-1½ year.  Storage of seeds in  metal bins with tight fitting lids or in a moisture proof bag will solve the  problems of moisture penetration, provided the seeds are already dry enough for  sealed storage.</p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Foundation stock and enforcement seed sample</strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>It is desirable to store  foundation and enforcement seeds for several years since genetic drift are minimized  by reproducing foundation or stock seeds.   Since the quantity of seeds involved is not large, the storage room is  only a small part of the total storage area and in fact, is often a small room  within a large warehouse.  Relative  humidity and temperature combination has to be provided for maintaining the  viability.  A combination of 25 per cent  RH at 30oC temperature or less or a RH of about 45 per cent at 20oC  or less will be ideal.  The required RH  can be achieved by making the room moisture proof and by using a dehumidifier.</p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Germplasm seed storage</strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>Germplasm seeds are required  to be kept for many years, perhaps very long periods.  Basic requirements for such long term storage  are the coldest temperature economically possible and seed moisture is in  equilibrium with 20-25 per cent RH.   Germplasm storage built up so far have rooms which can be maintained at  5oC to 10oC and 30 per cent RH.  In addition, the stored samples are dried to  perfect moisture level.</p>

				<h2 align="left">PRINCIPLES OF STORAGE</h2>
				<ol>
				  <li>Seed  storage conditions should be dry and cool</li>
				  <li>Effective  storage pest control</li>
				  <li>Proper  sanitation in seed stores</li>
				  <li>Before  placing seeds into storage they should be dried to safe moisture limits.</li>
				  <li>Storing  of high quality seed only i.e., well cleaned treated as well as high  germination and vigour.</li>
			    </ol>
				<h2 align="left">FACTORS AFFECTING SEED LONGEVITY IN STORAGE</h2>
				<ol>
				  <li>Kind  (or) variety of seed</li>
				  <li>Initial  seed quality</li>
				  <li>Moisture  content</li>
				  <li>Relative  humidity and temperature during storage</li>
				  <li>Provenance</li>
				  <li>The  activity of organisms associated with seeds in storage.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Kind  or variety of seed</strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>Seed storability is considerably influenced by the  kind or variety of seeds.  Some seeds are  short lived. E.g.: Onion, Soybean and Groundnut. As a general rule starchy  seeds can be stored considerably for a longer period compared to proteinaceous  or oily seeds because of their hygroscopic nature.</p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Initial  seed quality</strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>Seed lots having plumpy, vigorous undamaged seeds  store longer than that of deteriorated.   Even seed lots having good germination at the beginning of storage  period, may deteriorate at a faster rate depending upon the severity of  weathering damage, mechanical injury or otherwise in the field.  The low quality seeds should invariably be  rejected.  Even at best storage  conditions, the initial quality of the seed cannot be improved (except for the  dormant seed) but can only be maintained.</p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Moisture  content</strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>The most important factor influencing seed  viability during storage is the moisture content and the rate of deterioration  increases, as the seed moisture content increases.  The drier the seed the higher will be the  storage life.<br />
                    <strong>Seed moisture content (%)               Storage life</strong><br />
				  11-13                                                          ½  year<br />
				  10-12                                                          1 year<br />
				  9-11                                                             2 years<br />
				8-10                                                             4 years</p>
				<p>It is well known that higher moisture content  enhances the biological activity in the seeds and causes excessive heating,  besides promoting mould and insect activities.   The relationship of moisture content of seeds during post harvest stages  furnished below would clearly indicate the role of moisture in the life of  seeds in storage.</p>
				<p><strong>Role  and importance of moisture content in the life of seeds</strong></p>
				<p><img src="6164" /></p>
				<p>The importance of seed moisture content in  extending the shelf life of seeds under ideal storage conditions can be well  known and understood from the Harrington’s thumb rule, that one per cent  decrease in seed moisture content nearly doubles the storage potential of the  seed.   Again this rule is applicable  only at a moisture range of 5-14 per cent because, moisture content below 5 per  cent the physio chemical reaction may take place and at above 14 per cent fungi  and insects become active.  Another rule  given by Harrington states that for every 5oC decrease in storage  temperature, the seed life will be doubled.   Again this can hold good only in the temperature range of 0-50oC.  There are exceptions in this rule in a few  crops like chillies, brinjal and bhendi.   The safe moisture content again depends upon the period of storage,  storage structures, kind and variety of seed and the packaging materials  used.  For cereals under open storage,  seed drying upto 10 per cent moisture content appears quite satisfactory.  The storage in sealed containers during upto  4-8% moisture content depending upon the particular kind of seed may be  necessary. <br />
                  <strong>Use of desiccants </strong><br />
Desiccant like silicagel can maintain the moisture  content in equilibrium with the Relative Humidity of 45%. It is kept @ 1kg/10  kg of seeds. When the silicagel turns to pink colour it should be dried at 1750  in oven and then again placed in the container.<br />
<strong>4. Relative humidity and temperature during storage</strong><br />
Seeds are  hygroscopic. They attain rather specific and characteristic moisture content  when subjected to given level of atmospheric humidity at a particular  temperature (equilibrium moisture content). The equilibrium moisture content  for a particular kind of seed at a given relative humidity tends to increase as  temperature decreases and the deterioration starts.<br />
Equilibrium  moisture content varies among seed kinds.   In general, the equilibrium moisture content of “oily” seed is lower  than that of “starchy” seed at the same relative humidity and temperature.  This phenomenon can be accounted for by the  fact that fats and oils do not mix with water.   Thus, in a seed with 50% oil content, the moisture has to be  concentrated in half the seed, while in a seed containing 10% oil, the moisture  is distributed throughout 90% of the seed.<br />
Thus the maintenance of moisture content of seed  during storage is a function of RH and to a lesser extent of temperature.  At equilibrium moisture content there is no  net gain or loss in seed moisture content when seed is placed in a new  environment with RH higher or lower than that of the seed, the seed will gain  or lose moisture till it reaches a new equilibrium moisture content at this  particular new environment.</p>
				<h1>Dry,  cool conditions during storage</h1>
				<p>The general  prescription for seed storage is a dry and cool environment.  At this point, the question naturally  arises:  How dry and how cool? It is  difficult to answer this question unless three factors are known:  (1) kind(s) of seed to be stored; (2) desired  period of storage and (3) physiological quality of the seed.<br />
				  Seed of most grain crops, e.g., corn, wheat,  sorghum, barley, rye, oats, rice, will maintain germination for the 8-9 months  period from harvest to planting at moisture content of 12-13% and normal  warehouse temperature except possibly in Southern coastal areas.  For maintenance of vigour as well as  germination, moisture content should not exceed 12% (relative humidity below  60%) and temperature in the warehouse should not exceed 650 F.  In the case of carry-over seed, which means a  storage period of 20-21 months, the moisture content of seed of grain crops  should be less than 11% and temperature should not exceed 650  F.  Since the period of carry-over  storage encompasses atleast one summer period, temperatures and humidity  control during the period is most important.<br />
				  Cotton seed  stores about as well as seed of grain crops, and the conditions mentioned above  are applicable.<br />
				  Soybeans  and peanut seed are poor storers.  For  one year’s storage (actually 8-9 months), moisture content should be 11 to 12%  and the warehouse temperature should not exceed 650F.  Shelled peanuts may have to be stored in a  cold room.  Carry-over storage should not  be attempted unless conditioned storage facilities are available:  650F and 50% relative humidity or  better.<br />
				  Seed of  most forage grass and legume crops will store well for one year at moisture  content of 10-11% at normal warehouse temperatures.  When “carried-over”, moisture content should  be about 10% and temperature should not exceed 65%.<br />
				  Vegetable seed vary considerably among kinds in  their storage requirements.  Generally,  however, most kinds will store well for one year at a moisture content of 9-11%  and a temperature that does not exceed 650F.<br />
				  When a storage period longer than 19-21 months is  required, conditioned storage is essential for all kinds of seed.  Most kinds of seed will maintain quality for  2-3 years when stored at 600F and 50-55% relative humidity or  better.  For storage longer than 3 years,  conditions should be 500 F and 50% relative humidity or better.<br />
  <strong>5. Provenance</strong><br />
				  The seeds harvested in different climates (or) at  different times show differences in viability.   Because they would have been subjected to different pre harvest  conditions which will have caused different amounts of deterioration by the  time, the seeds are harvested.<br />
  <strong>6. The activity of organisms associated with seeds  in storage</strong><br />
				  The bacteria, fungi, mites, insects, rodents and  birds may do harm to seeds in storage. The general limits of temperature and  relative humidity for the multiplication of the various biological agencies  infesting stored seeds are, </p>

				<p>It is also interesting to note that the favourable  limits of temperature and RH for germination are 16-42oC and 95-100  per cent respectively.</p>
				<h1>Sanitation in storage</h1>
				<p>          There  are several other recognized procedures for good seed storage that most seeds  men already know.  Seeds should be stored  in a seed warehouse, not a fertilizer, chemicals, herbicide, or feed  warehouse.  Good sanitation should be a  continuous practice.  It will minimize  storage insect infestations.  If storage  insects are a problem, the judicious use of insecticides and fumigants,  combined with sanitation, will alleviate the problem.  The best procedure is not to place insect  infested lots in storage with other lots unless all the insects have been  killed by fumigation or insecticide treatment.<br />
				  In warehouse with concrete floors, seed bags  should be stacked on wooden pallets to keep them from contact with the floor as  considerable moisture can be transmitted through concrete floors.  Seed warehouses should also be adequately  ventilated (unless they are conditioned) and protected against rodents.</p>
				<h2 align="left">Storage Conditions</h2>
				<p>          Since seed moisture content and  ambient relative humidity are in equilibrium during storage, maintenance of a  “safe” moisture content requires an average level of relative humidity in the  storage environment no higher than that in equilibrium with the “safe” or  desired moisture content.  This favorable  situation can be achieved in only three ways:   (1) location of the storage facility in a region where relative humidity  does not rise – on the average – above the critical level;  (2) maintenance of the relative humidity at  the desired level by packaging seed in moisture vapor proof containers; or (3)  dehumidification of the storage room atmosphere to the desired level.  The desired level of relative humidity for  successful storage of seed depends, of course on the kind of seed, the duration  of the storage period, and the temperature.<br />
                    <strong>SEED PACKAGING IN RELATION TO SEED STORAGE</strong><br />
				  In  reality the seed package is a small storage container.  The kind of container needed is affected by  several factors including :</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>The quantity of seed desired in each package</li>
				  <li>The protection desired</li>
				  <li>The cost of the package</li>
				  <li>The value of the seed</li>
				  <li>The storage conditions into which the container is  to be placed and </li>
				  <li>The facilities for drying the seeds</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>Depending upon the cost availability  and the period of storage, the packaging materials are to be selected.  Normally cereal seeds are being packed in  cotton, jute and paper bags.  Moisture  vapour penetrates in these containers and they offer no protection against high  relative humidity.  In high humidity  locations with inadequate seed storage facilities, consideration should be  given to methods of packaging which can protect the seed from moisture  vapour.  Such moisture vapour proof  containers include paper aluminium foil pouches, polyethylene bags of over 700 gauge  thickness, sealed tins and gasketted rigid plastic containers.  The costs of these are high, for the package  of cereal seeds.  Polyethylene bags have  been regarded as the most attractive, because of their relatively low cost,  compared to other kinds of sealed containers.   Rigid plastic containers and sealed tins offer some possibility for  hybrid seeds of cotton and vegetables, if the quantity needed is not great.<br />
                    <strong>Classification  of packing materials or containers</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Moisture and vapour pervious containers</strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>These  containers allow entry of water in the from of vapour and liquid. These are  suited for short term storage. The seeds in these containers will attain seed  equilibrium moisture with the surrounding atmosphere (eg) cloth bags, gunny  bags, paper bags etc.<br />

                  <strong>Seed  storage in relation to seed deterioration</strong><br />
                  The Purpose  of seed storage has been previously stated, <strong><em>viz.</em></strong>, to preserve or  maintain the physiological quality of seed for the period desired through minimization  of the rate of deterioration.  Since seed  storage is basically concerned with “control” of deteriorative processes, some  knowledge of these processes is essential for successful seed storage  operations.<br />
                  <strong>Deteriorative changes in seed and their  consequences</strong><br />
                  In our  consideration of some of the characteristics of deterioration in seed, another  might have been added that deterioration is characterized by change.  Indeed, in our context, deterioration and  change – detrimental change – are almost synonymous.  For deterioration is identifiable only in  terms of observable or measurable changes in the response reactions of the  seed.  Conversely, detrimental changes,  e.g., loss of germination or vigour, are said to be the result of  deterioration.<br />
                  In the  sequence of deteriorative changes postulated in figure 1, it can be readily  seen that during deterioration, the “performance potential” of seed becomes  progressively impaired (reduced) until they lose their capacity to germinate,  at which time “performance potential” is zero.   Since loss of the capacity to germinate is the last practically  significant consequence of deterioration, the design and evaluation of storage  conditions only in terms of “maintenance of germination” is not  sufficient.   The “lesser consequences”  of deterioration must also be considered because collectively they determine  the “vigour” level of the seed.  And, the  vigour of seed determines how well they germinate, emerge, grow, and develop in  the farmer’s field.<br />
                  <strong>Longevity  of seed is a characteristic of the species or variety</strong><br />
                  Some kinds of seed are inherently  long-lived, others are short-lived, while others have an “intermediate” life  span.  Differences in storability extend  even down to the variety level.  It has  been known, for example, the certain inbred lines of corn are “poor storers”  and that this characteristic is inherited. <br />
                Inherent differences in seed longevity  are facts, the seeds man must accept and contend with as best he can.  Among the vegetables, onion seed are  notoriously short-lived, radish seed are intermediate in longevity, and  watermelon seed are relatively long-lived.   Soybean and peanut seed do not store well as compared to seed of wheat,  corn, cotton, sorghum and rice.  In some  cases, seed kinds which have very similar chemical and physical properties  differ substantially in longevity.  Tall  fescue and annual ryegrass seed are similar in structure, chemical composition,  and yet, ryegrass seed store better than tall fescue seed.<strong> </strong></p>
				<p><strong>Possible Sequence of changes in seed during deterioration</strong><br />
                  <strong><img width="490" height="541" src="lec30_clip_image002_0001.jpg" /></strong></p>
				<p><strong>Seed selection for extended storability</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li> Store well mature seeds.</li>
				  <li> Store normal coloured seeds</li>
				  <li> Seeds should be free from mechanical injury</li>
				  <li> Seeds should not have met with adverse  conditions during maturation</li>
				  <li> Seeds should be dried to optimum moisture  content.</li>
				  <li> Seeds should be treated with fungicides  before storage.</li>
				  <li> Suitable packaging materials should be  used for packing. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>High quality seed store better than low quality  seed</strong><br />
				  The storage potential of seed is  greatly affected by their quality at the time they enter storage, or their  pre-storage history.  The pre storage  history of a seed lot encompasses all the “events” in the “life” of the seeds  from the time functional maturity is reached until they are placed in storage.<br />
				  Seeds are highest in quality at the  time functional maturity is attained.   Since most kinds of seed reach maturity at moisture contents too high  for mechanical harvest, the seeds are subjected to the field environment from  maturation to harvest.  The  post-maturation pre-harvest period normally ranges from 1 to 4 weeks for the  different kinds of seed.  Adverse  climatic conditions can result in rapid and severe deterioration of the seed,  and so on.  The degree of deterioration  that occurs in seed prior to harvest determines their quality at harvest and  conditions their performance in storage.<br />
				  In like manner, mechanical, abuse to  seed associated with harvesting, handling and processing operations, and damage  caused by inadequate or improper aeration or drying can have both immediate and  residual effects, i.e., performance of the seed might be affected at the time  of injury or not until some later time during storage.<br />
				  In characterizing seed deterioration,  we pointed out that the rate of deterioration of seed in storage varies among  seed lots of the same kind and among individual seeds within a lot.  These variations in storability are, of  course, related to the pre-storage history of seed lots.  Seed lots with a “good” pre-storage history  (minimal field deterioration, mechanical damage, etc.) store well, while those  with a “bad” pre-storage history store poorly.<br />
  <strong>STORAGE  GODOWNS AND THEIR MAINTENANCE</strong><br />
				  Seeds undergo deterioration due to aging in storage. This  is accelerated by climatic factors and external biotic factors like insects and  pathogen. In addition to seed borne pathogen and storage insects, seeds are  damaged by birds and rats for their feed. Clean and hygienic godowns protect  the seed from external insects and preserve the seed. Hence care should be  taken in construction of godown. The points to be noted are as follows. <br />

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Seed godown should be in a place where       transport facilities are easily available. </li>
				  <li>Seed godowns should not be constructed in       areas near seashore. Since the high RH of atmospheric air accelerate the       deterioration of seed. </li>
				  <li>Seed godown should not be constructed in low       lying water stagnating areas. </li>
				  <li>Seed godown should be constructed in places       where atmospheric RH is low, free circulation of air is possible, sunlight       is adequate and elevated in nature.</li>
				  <li>The ventilators should be at bottom for free       air circulation.</li>
				  <li>Ground moisture should not reach the floor. </li>
				  <li>Should be rat proof with wire mesh</li>
				  <li>Should not be near industries as smoke is       injurious </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>In maintenance of seed in godown following points  are to be considered. </p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Godown should be clean and dry</li>

                  <br clear="all" />
                  <li>The height of the stack should not be more       than 6-8 bags.</li>
				  <li>Different seed lot should be kept separately.</li>
				  <li>Godown should be sprayed periodically once in       a week or fortnightly with Malathion 50 EC (1 : 300 Chemical : Water) @ 5       lit. sq. m-1 or 0.25% Nuvan @ 1 lit. 100 m3-1. </li>
				  <li>Altering the chemicals at weekly intervals       will give better control.</li>
				  <li>Seed lots can be fumigated with Aluminium       phophide @ 3 gm/cu.m in air tight condition for 7 days. This can be done       as propylatic measure and on minimum infestation by insects.</li>
				  <li>Seed lots should be periodically (once in       month) tested for seed quality. </li>
				  <li>Based on seed testing result, seeds can be       dried under sun for the removal of moisture. It reduces insect and       pathogen infestation.</li>
				  <li>New seed lots should be kept away from old       seed lots to avoid secondary infestation of insects.</li>
				  <li>Seeds should be treated with combination of       fungicide and insecticide (eg.) Thiram @ 2 g kg-1 + carbaryl @ 200 mg       kg-1.</li>
				  <li>Frequent supervision of each and every lot is       must.</li>
				  <li>Seed bag should be restacked once in 3 months       for free aeration. </li>
				  <li>Instead of gunny bags low cost interwoven       polythene bags should be used to prolong the life of seed.</li>

				<p><strong>STORAGE  INSECT MANAGEMENT</strong><br />
                    <strong>Maintenance  of store house hygiene</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Cracks and crevices around corners have to be  brushed to eliminate hiding pests.  All  debris should be removed.  Provision of  wire meshes to windows, ventilators, <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/gutter">gutters</a>, drains to prevent  entry of rats, squirrels, birds, etc.</li>
				  <li>Reduce the moisture content of seed to prevent  insect build up (usually below 10%).   Previously used bags, bins, etc. should be dried in the sun repeatedly.</li>
				  <li>Elimination of conditions which favour storage  pests. Uniformly graded seeds should be used, broken seeds should be removed  before bagging since they favour pest build up.   Stitching of all torn bags, filling bags up to the brim, no loose  packing.</li>
				  <li>Surface treatment of storehouse before storage with  malathion dust 4% @ 25 g/sq m or malathion 50% EC spray  @ 10 ml/lit of water and 3 lit of solution  per sq. metre.</li>
				  <li>Good dunnage by arranging wooden planks or bamboo  poles or spreading thick polythene sheets on the floor.  Treatment of dunnage materials with malathion  as specified, arrange the bags in criscross pattern with a maximum of 15 bags  and provide adequate space between the roof and the seed bags.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Prophylatic  treatment of seeds</strong><br />
				  Application  of malathion 4 per cent dust 25 g/sq metre or malathion 50 per cent EC 10 ml  per litre of water and 3 litres of spray solution for 100 sq.m. The chemicals  have to be sprayed on the walls and floors and the treatment has to be repeated  based on the extent of flying and crawling insects.</p>
				<h1>Chemicals</h1>
				<p>          Two  chemicals are widely used : Phosphine and Methyl Bromide.  Others are dichlorvos, Carbondioxide,  Ethylene oxide and HCN.<br />
                    <strong>Phosphine :</strong> Available in a solid form (0.6 g pellets, 3 g  tablets).  The active ingredient is  Aluminium phosphide mixed with Ammonium carbonate and Paraffin.  After exposure to the atmosphere, the pellets  decompose and release the active substance, hydrogen phosphide (PH3),  which has the same specific weight as air, and is thus evenly distributed in  the fumigated material or chamber.   Phosphine is also able to penetrate bags, carton boxes and other  containers.<br />
				  It  must be borne in mind that fumigation particularly repeated fumigation, may  seriously reduce the vigour and viability.   This is particularly true for seeds with a higher moisture content of 14  per cent.  Seeds with moisture content  above 14 per cent should be dried, before fumigation.<br />
				  Samples  of seeds have to be drawn at fortnight intervals and the infestation can be  classified as follows based on insects found per kg of sample.<br />
				  When  there is no pest               Free<br />
				  Upto  2 insects                          Mild<br />
				  More  than 2 insects                  Severe<br />
				  The  fumigant has to be chosen and the requirement worked out on the following  guidelines :<br />
  <strong>Aluminium  phosphide:</strong> Three tablets of 3 g each per ton of seed for  cover fumigation (only selected blocks of bags)<br />
				  Twenty  one tablets of 3g each for 28 cubic metres, for shed fumigation (entire godown).  Period of fumigation - 5 days. The major advantages of Phostoxin are that it  lacks residues and does not affect flavor or germination and is easy to handle.<br />
  <strong>Methyl bromide:</strong> Above 5.6oC, methyl bromide is in the gas phase and is available in  cylinders similar to those used for cooking gas.  Since, it is odorless, other gases such as  chloropicrin are sometimes added to facilitate detection of leaks.  Because methyl bromide is 3.5 times heavier  than air, care has to be taken that it is properly distributed within the goods  to be fumigated (fan can be used).  The  recommended dosage is 20 g/m3 for 24-48 hrs.<br />
				  Special  safety measures are required, since methyl bromide is absorbed through the  skin.  It tends to accumulate in commodities  which are important whenever repeated fumigation is necessary.<br />
  <strong>Equipment</strong><br />
				  Gas-proof  plastic sheets with at least 50 cm overlap firmly pressed to the ground with  sand, iron bars, or other weights are frequently used.  Gas escape results in reduced insecticidal  effect and is a hazard to users.  A  cement floor is necessary to prevent gas escape through soil.  Care must be taken that the fumigation area  is properly aerated and fans sometimes help.<br />
				  If a  store’s door and windows can be hermetically sealed, fumigation of the entire  store is possible.  Most stores, however,  allow gas to escape through other openings.   Silos are usually good fumigation facilities.  When large quantities must be fumigated  within a short time, a vaccum fumigation chamber is appropriate.  These chambers are available in sizes between  1 and 50 m3, and sometimes as a plant of upto 6 x 50 m3,  equipped with common fans, pumps and other equipment.  The insecticides used are methyl bromide or  ethylene oxide.<br />
  <strong>Safety</strong><br />
				  Face  masks with a proper canister should be used, especially during the aeration  process.  When handling Phostoxin, cotton  gloves should be worn.  Gas concentration  can be checked with a Halide gas detector for methyl bromide and with a tube  detector (Draeger) for Phostoxin.  A  warning sign should be clearly visible to prevent people from inadvertently  removing plastic sheets or entering a building under fumigation.<br />
  <strong>Rodent  Management in Store Houses</strong><br />
  <strong>          </strong>Provide  of wire mesh to windows, ventilators, drains and leave no gaps to doors.  Use rodent baits with multi dose or  anticoagulant rodenticides.  The bait may  be prepared as follows:<br />
				  Cereal  flour                                                            450 g<br />
				  Any  edible oil                                                         10  g<br />
				  Powdered  jaggery                                                   15 g<br />
				  Anticoagulant  or rodenticide such as coumarin      25 g<br />
				  Replace  the consumed bait daily.  If needed the  single dose or acute poison bait may be prepared as follows :<br />
				  Food  material                                                         97 g<br />
				  Edible  oil                                                                1 g<br />
				  Zinc  phosphide                                                      2 g<br />
				  Before  providing the poisoned zinc phosphide bait, the plain or non-poisoned bait are  to be provided for two or three days to make the rats accept the bait.</p>
