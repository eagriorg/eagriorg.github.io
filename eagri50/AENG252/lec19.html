				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaporation is an operation used to remove a  liquid from a solution, suspension, or emulsion by boiling off some of the  liquid. It is thus a thermal separation, or thermal concentration, process. We  define the evaporation process as one that starts with a liquid product and  ends up with a more concentrated, but still liquid and still pumpable  concentrate as the main product from the process. There are actually a few  instances where the evaporated, volatile component is the main product, but we  will not discuss that here.</p>
                <p>            In  most cases it is essential that the product be subject to minimal thermal  degradation during the evaporation process, requiring that temperature and time  exposure must be minimized. This and other requirements brought on by the  physical characteristics of the processed product have resulted in the  development of a large range of different evaporator types. Additional demands  for energy efficiency and minimized environmental impact have driven  development toward very innovative plant configurations and equipment design. </p>
                <p>            In  the field of thermal separation / concentration technology, evaporation plants  are widely used for concentration of liquids in the form of solutions,  suspensions, and emulsions. The major requirement in the field of evaporation  technology is to maintain the quality of the liquid during evaporation and to  avoid damage to the product. This may require the liquid to be exposed to the  lowest possible boiling temperature for the shortest period of time. This and  numerous other requirements and limitations have resulted in a wide variation  of designs available today. In almost all evaporators the heating medium is  steam, which heats a product on the other side of a heat transfer surface. The  following list contains the descriptions of the most common types of  evaporators.</p>

                <p><strong>Falling Film  Evaporators </strong><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In falling film evaporators, liquid  and vapors flow downwards in parallel flow. The liquid to be concentrated is  preheated to boiling temperature. An even thin film enters the heating tubes  via a distribution device in the head of the evaporator, flows downward at  boiling temperature, and is partially evaporated. This gravity-induced downward  movement is increasingly augmented by the co-current vapor flow. <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falling  film evaporators can be operated with very low temperature differences between  the heating media and the boiling liquid, and they also have very short product  contact times, typically just a few seconds per pass. These characteristics  make the falling film evaporator particularly suitable for heat-sensitive  products, and it is today the most frequently used type of evaporator. </p>

                  <p>However, falling  film evaporators must be designed very carefully for each operating condition;  sufficient wetting of the heating surface by liquid is extremely important for  trouble-free operation of the plant. If the heating surfaces are not wetted  sufficiently, dry patches and incrustations will occur; at worst, the heating  tubes will be completely clogged. In critical cases extending or dividing the  evaporator effects, keeping the advantages of single pass operation, can  increase the wetting rate. The proper design of the liquid distribution system  is critical to achieve full and even product wetting of the tubes.  Because of the low liquid holding volume in this  type of unit, the falling film evaporator can be started up quickly and changed  to cleaning mode or another product easily.   Falling film evaporators are highly responsive to alterations of  parameters such as energy supply; vacuum, feed rate, concentrations, etc. When  equipped with a well-designed automatic control system they can produce a very  consistent concentrated product. The fact that falling film evaporators can be  operated with small temperature differences makes it possible to use them in  multiple effect configurations or with mechanical vapor compression systems in  modern plants with very low energy consumption.</p>
                <h2>Rising Film Evaporators </h2>
                <p>            These operate on a &quot;thermo-siphon&quot; principle.  Feed enters the bottom of the heating tubes and as it heats, steam begins to  form. The ascending force of this steam produced during the boiling causes  liquid and vapors to flow upwards in parallel flow. At the same time the  production of vapor increases and the product is pressed as a thin film on the  walls of the tubes, and the liquid rises upwards. <br /></p>

                <p>This co-current  upward movement has the beneficial effect of creating a high degree of  turbulence in the liquid. This is advantageous during evaporation of highly  viscous products and products that have a tendency to foul the heating  surfaces. Usually there must be a rather high temperature difference between  the heating and boiling sides of this type of evaporator. Otherwise the energy  of the vapor flow is not sufficient to convey the liquid and to produce the  rising film. The length of the boiling tubes will typically not exceed 23 ft.  This type of evaporator is often used with product recirculation, where some of  the formed concentrate is reintroduced back to the feed inlet in order to  produce sufficient liquid loading inside the boiling tubes.<br /></p>
                  <p><strong>Forced Circulation  Evaporator </strong><br />
                  Forced  circulation evaporators are used if boiling of the product on the heating  surfaces is to be avoided due to the fouling characteristics of the product, or  to avoid crystallization. The flow velocity in the tubes must be high, and  high-capacity pumps are required. The circulating liquid is heated when it  flows through the heat exchanger and then partially evaporated when the  pressure is reduced in the separator, cooling the liquid to the boiling  temperature corresponding to this pressure.<br /></p>

                  <p>The  liquid is typically heated only a few degrees for each pass through the heat  exchanger, which means the recirculation flow rate has to be high. This type of  evaporator is also used in crystallizing applications because no evaporation,  and therefore no concentration increase, takes place on the heat transfer  surface. Evaporation occurs as the liquid is flash evaporated in the  separator/flash vessel. In crystallizer applications this is then where the  crystals form, and special separator designs are used to separate crystals from  the recirculated crystal slurry.  The  heat exchanger (in evaporator parlance sometimes called the  &quot;calandria&quot;) can be arranged either horizontally or vertically  depending on the specific requirements in each case. <br /></p>

  <strong>Methods of Operation of  Evaporators</strong></p>
                <ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li><strong>Single-effect       evaporators</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p> A simplified diagram of a single-stage or  single-effect evap­orator is given in <br />
                  Fig.1. The feed enters at TF K and saturated steam at Ts  enters the heat-exchange section. Condensed steam leaves as condensate or  drips. Since the solution in the evaporator is assumed to be completely mixed,  the concentrated product and the solution in the evaporator have the same  composition and temperature Tt, which is the boiling point of the  solution. The temperature of the vapor is also Tt, since it is in  equilibrium with the boiling solution. The pressure is P1, which is  the vapor pressure of the solution at Tt.<br />
                  If the solution to be evaporated is  assumed to be dilute and like water, then 1 kg of steam condensing will  evaporate approximately 1 kg of vapor. This will hold if the feed entering has  a temperature TF near the boiling point.<br />
                  The concept of an overall heat-transfer coefficient is  used in the calculation of the rate of heat transfer in an evaporator. The  general equation can be written</p>
                <p align="right"><img src="lec10_clip_image009.gif" alt="" width="159" height="24" hspace="12" align="left" />                                                (1)</p>
                <p>where  q is the rate of heat transfer in W, U is the overall heat-transfer coefficient  in W/m2. K, A is the heat-transfer area in m2, Tsk  is the temperature of the condensing steam in K, and Tl is the  boiling point of the liquid in K. <br /></p>
                  <p><center><img width="245" height="319" src="lec10_clip_image011.jpg" align="center" hspace="12" alt="FIG. 8.1 Evaporator" /></center></p>
               
                <p>            <br />
                  Single-effect evaporators are often  used when the required capacity of operation is relatively small and/or the  cost of steam is relatively cheap compared to the evaporator cost. However, for  large-capacity operation, using more than one effect will markedly reduce steam  costs.<br />
  <strong>2. Forward-feed  multiple-effect evaporators</strong> <br />
                A single-effect evaporator as shown  in Fig.1 is wasteful of energy since the latent heat of the vapor leaving is  not used but is discarded. However, much of this latent heat can be recovered  and reused by employing multiple-effect evaporators. A simplified diagram of a  forward-feed triple-effect evaporation system is shown in Fig.2. If the feed to  the first effect is near the boiling point at the pressure in the first effect  1 kg of steam will evaporate almost 1 kg of water. The first effect operates at  a high-enough temperature so that the evaporated water serves as the heating  medium to the second effect. Here, again, almost another kg of water is  evaporated, which can be used as the heating medium to the third effect. As a  very rough approximation, almost 3 kg of water will be evaporated for 1 kg of  steam for a three-effect evaporator. Hence, the steam economy, which is kg  vapor evaporated/kg steam used, is increased. This also approximately holds for  a number of effects over three. However, this increased steam economy of a  multiple-effect evaporator is gained at the expense of the original first cost  of these evaporators.<br /></p>
  <p><center><img width="400" height="326" src="lec10_clip_image012.gif" align="center" hspace="12" alt="FIG. 8.2 Double effect evaporator – forward feed" /></center></p>
                
                <p align="center"><strong>Fig 2. Double effect evaporator – forward feed </strong><br /></p>
                  <p>In forward-feed operation as  shown in Fig.2, the fresh feed is added to the first effect and flows to the  next in the same direction as the vapor flow. This method of operation is used  when the feed is hot or when the final concentrated product might be damaged at  high temperatures. The boiling temperatures decrease from effect to effect.  This means that if the first effect is at P1= 1 atm abs pressure,  the last effect will be under vacuum at a pressure P3.<br /></p>
  <strong>3. Backward-feed multiple-effect evaporators</strong> <br />
                <p> In the backward-feed  operation shown in Fig.3 for a triple-effect evaporator, the fresh feed enters  the last and coldest effect and continues on until the concentrated product  leaves the first effect. This method of reverse feed is advantageous when the  fresh feed is cold, since a smaller amount of liquid must be heated to the  higher temperatures in the second and first effects. However, liquid pumps are  used in each effect, since the flow is from low to high pressure. This method  is also used when the concentrated product is highly viscous. The high  temperatures in the early effects reduce the viscosity and give reasonable  heat-transfer coefficients.<br />
  <strong>4. Parallel-feed multiple-effect evaporators</strong> <br />
                  Parallel feed in multiple-effect  evaporators involves the adding of fresh feed and the withdrawal of  concentrated product from each effect. The vapor from each effect is still used  to heat the next effect. This method of operation is mainly used when the feed  is almost saturated and solid crystals are the product, as in the evaporation  of brine to make salt.</p>
