				<p><strong>U.S. FOOD SAFETY SYSTEM</strong><strong> </strong><br />
            The Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) is charged with protecting consumers against food that is impure, unsafe,  produced under unsanitary conditions, or fraudulently labeled. Through its Center  for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) and the Office of Regulatory  Affairs (ORA), the FDA regulates both domestic and imported foods, except meat  and poultry and processed eggs and has primary responsibility for enforcing  food safety laws including food import and export regulations. (FDA. 2001) Some  of the activities of the FDA with particular impact on imported produce include</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Inspecting food production establishments and  food warehouses and collecting and analyzing samples for physical, chemical,  and microbial contamination.</li>
                  <li>Establishing good agricultural practices and  good manufacturing practices and other production standards, such as plant  sanitation, packaging requirements, and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control  Point programs.</li>
                  <li>Sampling and inspection of imported foods.</li>
                  <li>Working with foreign governments (and with  FDA counterparts in these countries, if they exist) to ensure safety of  imported foods.</li>
                  <li>Taking appropriate enforcement actions.</li>
                  <li>Educating industry and consumers on safe food  handling practices.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>            The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) work closely with state and local public health epidemiologists  and laboratories to identify illnesses and clusters of illnesses that may be  food borne. CDC surveys and studies various environmental and chronic health  problems and administers national programs for prevention and control of  vector-borne diseases (diseases transmitted by a host organism) and other  preventable conditions.( CDC. 1999)<br />
                  The U.S. Department of Agriculture  (USDA) has several agencies that  may play a role in assuring food safety by establishing the safety of imported  fruits and vegetables.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)  carries out a wide range of programs aimed at facilitating the marketing of  agricultural products, assuring consumers a quality food supply, and ensuring  fair trading practices. Certain agricultural commodities (including fresh  tomatoes, avocados, mangoes, limes, oranges, grapefruit, green peppers, Irish  potatoes, cucumbers, eggplants, dry onions, walnuts and filberts, processed  dates, prunes, raisins, and olives in tins) must meet United States import  requirements relating to grade, size, quality, and maturity. These commodities  are inspected and the AMS must issue an inspection certificate to indicate  import compliance.</li>
                  <li>The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) has  primary responsibility for the USDA's overseas programs, including market  development, international trade agreements and negotiations, and the  collection of statistics and market information.</li>
                  <li>The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)  regulates meat, poultry and egg products and maintains a comprehensive system  of import inspection and controls. </li>
                  <li>The Economic Research Service (ERS) provides  estimates of costs of food borne disease and conducts benefit/cost analyses of  alternative regulatory options.</li>
                  <li>USDA&rsquo;s Animal and Plant Health Inspection  Service (APHIS) inspects imported agricultural products for disease and pests  which might infect plants and animals. Through monitoring activities at airport  terminals, seaports, and border stations, it guards U.S. borders against the  entry of foreign agricultural pests and diseases.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>            U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) includes regulating  pesticides and assuring that drinking water meets standards for health. Through  the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP), EPA determines the safety of new  pesticide products, sets tolerance levels for pesticide residues in foods.<br />
                  <strong>INTERNATIONAL FOOD LAWS  AND REGULATIONS</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanitary (human and animal health)  and phytosanitary (plant health) standards are necessary to ensure that food is  safe for consumers, to prevent the spread of pests and diseases among animals  and plants and to ensure fair practices in trade. In recent years, world food  trade has been profoundly altered by the adoption of agreements that provide a  more precise framework for trade, and define the rights and the obligations of  all partners. These agreements served to strengthen the status of institutions  like the Codex Alimentarius Commission and the International Plant Protection  Convention since these were used as a basis for harmonization.<br />
  <strong>THE URUGUAY ROUND  AGREEMENTS</strong><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Uruguay Round of Multilateral  Trade Negotiations, which concluded in 1994, established the World Trade  Organization (WTO) to replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT). The Uruguay Round negotiations were the first to deal with the  liberalization of trade in agricultural products, an area excluded from  previous rounds of negotiations. They also included negotiations on reducing  non-tariff barriers to international trade in agricultural products and  concluded with two binding agreements: the Agreement on the Application of  Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) and the Agreement on  Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement). The Agreement on the Application  of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures confirms the right of WTO member  countries to apply measures necessary to protect the life and health of humans,  animals and plants (FAO, 2000).<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade  was established with the objective of preventing the use of national or  regional technical requirements, or standards in general, as unjustified  barriers to trade (FAO, 2000). The agreement covers standards relating to all  types of products including industrial and agricultural products. Not covered  are food standards related to sanitary and phyto sanitary measures. It includes  numerous measures designed to protect consumers against deception and economic  fraud. Examples of food standards covered by the TBT Agreement are those  related to quality and labeling. The TBT Agreement basically provides that all  technical standards and regulations must have a legitimate purpose and that the  impact or cost of implementing a standard must be proportional to the purpose  of the standard. It also says that if there are two or more ways of achieving  the same objective, the least trade-restrictive alternative should be followed.  The agreement also places emphasis on international standards and WTO members  are obliged to use international standards or parts of them except where the  international standard would be ineffective or inappropriate in the national  situation. The TBT Agreement does not include a program for harmonizing  national standards.<br />
  <strong>CODEX ALIMENTARIUS</strong><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adoption of the SPS and TBT  Agreements resulted in new emphasis and importance being placed on the work of  Codex in establishing international food quality and safety standards.<br />
                  Codex Alimentarius<br />
                  The  purpose of Codex is </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>to guide and promote the elaboration of  definitions and requirements for foods and assist in their harmonization</li>
                  <li>to facilitate world trade</li>
                  <li>to promote consumer protection</li>
                </ul>
                <p>            The name Codex Alimentarius is taken  from Latin and translates literally as &ldquo;food code&rdquo; or &ldquo;food law&rdquo;. The Codex  Alimentarius is a series of food standards, codes and other regulations adopted  by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) that countries can use as models in  their domestic food legislation and regulations, and which can be applied to  international trade. Codex provides the assurance that any foods produced  according to its codes of hygienic practices and complying with its standards  are safe and nutritious and offer adequate health protection. The CAC was  created in 1962 by two United Nations organizations, the Food and Agriculture  Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Its main purpose is  to promote consumer protection and to facilitate world trade in foods through  the development of food standards, codes of practice and other guidelines  (FAO/WHO, 1999). Since its inception, the CAC has been responsible for  implementing the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Program (FAO, 2000).<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CAC is an intergovernmental body  with a current membership of 165 Member governments. Membership is open to all  Member Nations and Associate Members of FAO and WHO. In addition, observers  from international scientific, food industry, food trade and consumer  associations may attend sessions of the Commission and of its subsidiary bodies.  While observer organizations can fully participate in the proceedings of the  meeting, by statute, only Member governments can participate in any decision  process. To facilitate international trade, it has been necessary for efforts  to be made to harmonize food standards. Those involved in harmonization efforts  recognized that countries have the right to adopt standards they feel are  appropriate to protect human, animal and plant health and the environment. They  also have the right to take the steps necessary to assure these standards are  met. However, preventing these standards from becoming barriers to trade is  important to promote trade between countries (FAO, 1998).<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Codex Alimentarius is a series  of food standards, codes and other regulations adopted by the Codex  Alimentarius Commission (CAC) that countries can use as models in their  domestic food legislation and regulations, and which can be applied to  international trade. Codex provides the assurance that any foods produced  according to its codes of hygienic practices and complying with its standards  are safe and nutritious and offer adequate health protection.The Codex  Committee on Food Hygiene is currently developing a code of hygienic practice  for fresh fruits and vegetables entitled <em>&ldquo;Draft Code of Hygienic Practice  for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables&rdquo;. </em>This draft code addresses GAPs and GMPs  that will help control microbial, chemical, and physical hazards associated  with all stages of the production of fresh fruits and vegetables from primary  production to packaging. To facilitate international trade, harmonization of  food standards is necessary to prevent these standards from becoming barriers  to trade between countries.<br />
  <strong>INDIAN  STANDARDS</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a  number of food laws being implemented by various Ministries/Departments. These  are primarily meant for two purposes namely   (1) Regulation of Specifications of food and (2) Regulation of Hygienic  condition of Processing/Manufacturing. Some of these food laws are mandatory  and some are voluntary. The details of various food laws in operation in India  are as under:-<br />
                  A. Food Laws<br />
                  The main Acts/Regulations/Control orders to regulate trade</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Prevention of Food Adulteration Act 1954</li>
                  <li>Plant Quarantine (Regulation of Import into India) Order, 2003</li>
                  <li>Meat Food Product Order 1973</li>
                  <li>Milk And Milk Product Order 1992</li>
                  <li>Bureau Of Indian Standards Act, 1986</li>
                  <li>Standards On Weight And Measurement Act, 1976</li>
                  <li>Livestock Importation Act, 1898</li>
                  <li>AGMARK Act ,1937</li>
                  <li>The Infant Milk Substitutes, Feeding  Bottles and Infant Foods Act ,1992</li>
                  <li>Export (Quality Control and Inspection)  Act, 1963</li>
                  <li>Essential commodities Act,1955</li>
                  <li>Indian Explosives Act,1884</li>
                  <li>Energy Conservation Act, 2001 </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>1. Prevention of Food Adulteration Act (Ministry of Health)</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act lays down  specifications for various food products and is mandatory. The Ministry of  Health in 1995 had constituted a Task Force. This Task Force recommended that  there should be emphasis on good manufacturing practices instead of detection  of adulteration and prosecution. It also expresses concern about lack of  laboratory equipments and quantified persons. In addition it also suggested  that the name of PFA Act be changed to Food Safety Act.<br />
  <strong>2. Agriculture Produce (Grading &amp; Marking) Act (Ministry of  Rural development)</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Act is  commonly known as AGMARK and is voluntary. The Act lays down the specifications  for various agricultural commodities including some processed foods.<br />
  <strong>3. Laws being operated by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BIS is the  largest body for formulating standards for various food items. These standards  are also voluntary.<br />
  <strong>4. Essential Commodities Act</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of  quality control orders have been issued under Essential Commodities Act such as  FPO, MMPO, Meat Product Order and Vegetable Oils Control Order. These orders  are mandatory and primarily meant for regulating the hygienic conditions. They  need to be clubbed under one order which may called Food Products Order.<br />
  <strong>B. Harmonization of Food Laws</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review of  multiple laws is necessary to have a uniform and logical approach for  regulating the quality of food. The following action is being taken by various  Ministries:-<br />
  <strong>1. </strong>The Ministry of Civil Supplies &amp; Consumer Affairs has brought  out a paper for consideration of Committee of Secretaries (COS). The paper  recommends that BIS should formulate standards for all food items in the  country. This will be a major step towards harmonization of food laws and is  still under consideration of COS for finalization.<br />
                  2.   The Task Force had  advocated promotion of food safety and quality. The Task Force has further made  following suggestions</p>
                <ul>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Food Regulation Authority (FRA) be set up to formulate and update  food standards for domestic and export market. </li>
                    <li>FRA should replace the PFA to conform to international standards.  The Task Force has given ten specific recommendations such as provision of  storage, simplification of sampling procedure, simplification of procedure for  nominee, time limit for prosecution, standard methods of analysis to be  prescribed, penalty should graded according to the gravity of offences and  provision of adequate/infrastructure and laboratories. </li>
                    <li>Harmonization of Indian standard with quality norms of Codex and  WTO. </li>
                    <li>The Central Committee of food Standard (CCFS) should be replaced  by FRA Governing Body for expeditious decisions.</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
