                <p><strong>Theory</strong><br />
                  <strong>Three types of forces</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Compression </li>
                    <li>Impact</li>
                    <li>Shearing  or Attrition forces</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>            Stress is applied to a food; the  resulting internal strains are first absorbed to cause deformation of the  tissues. Amount of energy needed to fracture a food is determined by its  hardness and tendency to crack – in turn depends on the structure of the food.  Fewer the lines of weakness in a food, the higher are the energy input needed  to cause fracturing. Harder foods absorb more energy and require a greater  energy input to create fractures. Extent of size reduction, the energy expanded  and the amount of heat generated in the food depend on both the size of the  forces that are applied and the time that food is subjected to the forces.  Compression forces are used to fracture friable or crystalline foods. Combined  impact and shearing forces are necessary for fibrous foods. Shearing forces are  used for fine grinding of softer foods.<br />
                  <strong>Factors  influencing the energy input </strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Moisture content</strong></li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Wheat  is conditioned to optimum moisture content</li>
                    <li>Maize  is thoroughly soaked and wet milled for complete disintegration</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li><strong>Heat sensitivity of the food</strong></li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Determines  the permissible temperature rise and the necessity to cool the mill</li>
                    <li>Liquid  N2 or solid CO2 are mixed with foods before milling to  cool the product and to retain volatiles</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Quantum  of the forces that are applied </li>

                  <strong>Crushing  rolls</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Mainly  used for extraction of juice from sugarcane</li>
                  <li>Two  types</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Smooth  roll crusher</li>
                    <li>Serrated  or toothed roll crusher</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Smooth  roll crusher</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Two  heavy smooth faced roll rotating towards each other at same speed on parallel  horizontal axes</li>
                  <li>Size  of the material caught by the rolls depends upon the coefficient of friction  between the material and the roll surface</li>
                  <li>Dp  = 0.04R + g</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Dp – maximum size of  particle<br />
                  R – roll radius<br />
                  g – half of the width of gap  between the rolls</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Used  to make grits or meal from food grains</li>
                  <li>One  of the rolls should be spring loaded to avoid any damage to roll surface</li>
                  <li>Extensively  used for making food grains flakes</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Serrated  or toothed roll crusher</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Rolls  are serrated as per need</li>
                  <li>Much  more versatile than smooth roll crusher</li>
                  <li>Best  example – Break and reduction rolls of wheat milling</li>
                  <li>Disintegrators  are toothed roll crushers in which the corrugated rolls are rotating at  different speeds</li>
                  <li>Size  reduction is by compression, impact and shear and not by compression alone, as  in the case of smooth roll crushers</li>
                  <li>Can  accommodate larger particles than smooth roll crushers</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Crushing  efficiency</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Ratio  of the surface energy created by crushing to the energy absorbed by the solid</li>

                <p><strong>Salient  features</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Ball  mill </strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Cylindrical  or conical shell slowly rotating about a horizontal axis.</li>
                  <li>Half  of its volume is filled with solid grinding balls</li>
                  <li>Shell  is made of steel lined with high carbon steel plate, porcelain or silica rock.</li>
                  <li>Size  reduction is achieved by impact of the balls when they drop from near the top  of the shell</li>
                  <li>Energy  consumed in lifting the balls is utilized for grinding job</li>
                  <li>When  the ball mill is rotated , the balls are carried by the mill wall nearly to the  top</li>
                  <li>Balls  are released by the gravitational pull and drop to the bottom and picked up  again</li>
                  <li>Centrifugal  force keeps the ball in contact with the mill wall.</li>
                  <li>Due  to centrifugal force, if the speed of rotation of mill is faster, the balls are  carried to more distance.</li>
                  <li>Centrifuging:  In case of too high speed, balls stick to mill wall and are not released</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Critical  speed</strong>: Rotational  speed at which centrifuging occurs</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>At  this speed, no impact occurs hence little or no grinding results</li>
                  <li>Operating  speed must be kept less than the critical speed</li>
                  <li>Speed  at which the outermost ball released from the mill wall depends on the  interaction of gravitational and centrifugal forces</li>
                  <li>Critical  speed can be determined by</li>

                <p><strong>Roller  mills</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Roller  mills are similar to roller crushers</li>
                  <li>They  have smooth or finely fluted rolls, and rotate at differential speeds. </li>
                  <li>They  are used very widely to grind flour.</li>
                  <li>Because  of their simple geometry, the maximum size of the particle that can pass  between the rolls can be regulated.</li>
                  <li>If  the friction coefficient between the rolls and the feed material is known, the  largest particle that will be nipped between the rolls can be calculated,  knowing the geometry of the particles.
