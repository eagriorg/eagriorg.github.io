      <hr />
      <p><span class="style6"><strong>7. Wheat-gall Nematode: </strong><strong><em>Anguina tritici</em> (Tylenchidae: Tylenchida) </strong>  </span></p>
      <p align="left"><strong><br />
        </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Distribution  and status:</strong> Cosmoplitan.  It causes ear-cockle or <em>mamni </em>disease. The nematode is also the carrier of the  bacterial yellow slime ear-rot <em>(tundu </em>disease) caused by <em>Corynebacterium  tritici</em><br />
        <strong><br />
        Host  range: </strong>Rye<em>, </em>spelt  and emer. Oats and barley are immune. <strong></strong><br />
        <strong><br />
        Damage symptoms: </strong>If the black rounded <em>mamni </em>galls are soaked in water  overnight, the coat softens and a large number of larvae are set free.Affected  plants are more or less stunted and their leaves are wrinkled, rolled or  twisted. A variable number of grains in an infested ear may produce galls. The  diseased ears are shorter and thicker than the healthy ones and the glumes are  spread farther apart<br />
<strong><br />
Bionomics: </strong>Under  natural conditions, the dry galls either fall to the ground from the ripe ears  or they are harvested and find their way to the stores along with the healthy  produce. The galls though dry remain viable for long periods. Single gall  contains 800 to 30,000 larvae which revive and become active when the gall is  moistened. <br />
      <br />
When  wheat is sown, the galls become soft on imbibing moisture and the larvae are  set free into the soil. From there, they reach the host plants, if available within a distance of one third  of a metre. They rise up the plant and find a site for feeding as free  parasites on the young leaves and the growing-points. Later on, as the plants  approach the earing stage, they penetrate into the primordia of the flower-buds  and form the galls instead of normal seed. <br />
      <br />
In the developing  galls, the larvae mature into males and females, as the case may be. A single gall at this stage may contain 40  females and an equal number of males. They mate within the gall and the gravid  females lay a large number of eggs. The young larvae on emerging from the eggs  develop up to the second stage and then become dormant. They remain in that  state in the dry galls till the next sowing season. There is only one  generation in a year. <br />
<strong><br />
Management: </strong>The wheat  gall nematode can be controlled by separating the galls from the wheat seed by  floating them on water in a tub. The galls, being lighter, float on the surface  and may be skimmed off. The seed should then be dried before sowing. (ii)The  pest can also be suppressed by sowing clean seed in uninfested soil. Only one  year's fallowing is sufficient to eradicate this nematode from the fields. <br />
