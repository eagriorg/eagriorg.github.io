      </table>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>MANAGEMENT OF STORAGE PESTS </strong><br />
      The  effective management of storage pests may be ensured by drying the grains  properly before storage, storing new grains in the clean godowns or receptacles  and plugging all cracks, crevices and holes in the godowns thoroughly. If infestation  of grain has already taken place, then application of chemicals becomes  necessary. </p>
      <p><br />
        <strong>1. Surface treatment</strong><br />
        Disinfect  old gunny bags by dipping them in 0.0125 per cent fenvalerate 20EC or cypermethrin  25EC for 10 minutes and drying them in shade before filling with grains or use  new gunny bags. Disinfect empty godowns or receptacles by spraying 0.05 per  cent malathion emulsion on the floor, walls and ceiling. <br />
        <strong>2. Seed treatment.</strong><br />
        Mixing  of malathion 5 per cent at the rate of 250 g per quintal of seed is  recommended. The grains may also be treated with/25 ml of malathion 50 EC or 2  ml of fenvalerate 20EC or 1.5 ml of cypermethrin 25EC or 14 ml of deltamethrin  2.8EC per quintal of seed by diluting in 500 ml of water. Against pulse beetle  (dhora), cover the pulses stored in bulk with 7 cm layer of sand or sawdust or  dung ash. <br />
        <strong>3. Fumigation</strong><br />
        Metallic drums or wooden boxes can  be used for fumigating small quantities of grain. In India, ethylene dichloride  and carbon tetrachloride mixture has been recommended for fumigation of  foodgrains in storage at farm level, and hydrogen phosphide in the form of  aluminium phosphide or methyl bromide for protection in warehouses, godowns and  silos. <br />
        Mixture  of ethylene dichloride and carbon tetrachloride at the rate of 1 litre for 20  quintals of grain or 35 litres per 100 m3 of space with exposure period of 4  days is recommended. Methyl bromide is used at the rate of 3.5 kg per 100 m3  of space with 10-12 hours exposure. The fumigant, hydrogen phosphide (aluminium  phosphide), is available in tablet form and can be used at the rate of one  tablet (3 g) per metric tonne or 25 tablets per 100 m3 of space with  an exposure period of 7 days. <br />
        <strong>Use of improved storage receptacles</strong>:<br />
        The grains can be best protected by using improved  insect-proof receptacles of various types. <br />
        <strong>(a) Indoor Bins </strong><br />
        Domestic  metal bins, Gharelu theka, Pucca kothi, Welded wire-mesh bin, Reinforced cement  ring bins, Paddy straw-mud structure.<br />
        <strong>(b) Outdoor Bins </strong><br />
        Flat  and hopper bottom-metal bins, Composite bins, Partly underground and above  ground structures, Seed storage bins,  Ferro-cement bins, Pusa bin, Improved godowns, Bulk storage  installations and Vacuum process storage. <br />
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>INTEGRATED  MANAGEMENT OF STORED PRODUCE PESTS</strong><br />
        The  control methods of stored produce pests can be categorized into preventive and  curative measures.<br />
        <strong>Preventive measures       </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Brush the cracks, crevices and corners to  remove all debris in the godown.</li>
        <li>Clean and maintain the threshing floor/yard  free from insect infection and away from the vicinity of villages.</li>
        <li>Clean the machines like harvester and  thresher before their use.</li>
        <li>Made the trucks, trolleys or bullock carts  free from infestation.</li>
        <li>Clean the godowns/ storage structures before  storing the newly harvested crop to eliminate various bio stages of pest  hiding.</li>
        <li>Provide a metal sheet upto a height of 25 cm  at the bottom of the wood in doors to arrest the entry of rats.</li>
        <li>Fix up wire meshes to windows, ventilators,  gutters, drains etc., to prevent entry of rats, birds and squirrels.</li>
        <li>Remove and destroy dirt, rubbish, sweepings  and webbings etc from the stores.</li>
        <li>Close all the rat burrows found in godown  with a mixture of broken glass pieces and mud plastered with mud/ cement.</li>
        <li>Plaster the cracks, crevices, holes found on  walls, and floors with mud or cement and white wash the stores before storing  of grains.</li>
        <li>Provide dunnage leaving gangway or alleyway  of 0.75 to 1 m all around to maintain good storage condition.</li>
        <li>Store the food grains in rat and moisture  proof storage structures.</li>
        <li>Disinfest the storage structures receptacles  by spraying malathion 50 EC @ 3 lit 100 m before their use.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Curative measures</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Ecological methods</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Manipulate the ecological factors like  temperature, moisture content and oxygen through design and construction of  storage structures/ godown and storage to create ecological conditions  unfavourable for attack by insects.</li>
        <li>Temperature above 420 C and below  150 C retards reproduction and development of insect while prolonged  temperature above 450 C and below 100 C may kill the  insects.</li>
        <li>Dry the produce to have moisture content  below 10% to prevent the buildup of pests.</li>
        <li>Kill the pests bio stages harbored in the  storage bags, bins etc., by drying in the sun light.</li>
        <li>Store the grains at around 10 % moisture  content to escape from the insects attack.</li>
        <li>Manipulate and reduce oxygen level by 1% to  increase the CO2 level automatically, which will be lethal to all  the stages of insects.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Physical methods</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide  a super heating system by infrared heaters in the floor mills and food  processing plants to obtain effective control of pests since mostly the stored  produce insects die at 55 –600C in 10 – 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Modify  the storage atmosphere to generate low oxygen (2.4% and to develop high carbon  di oxide (9.0 – 9.5) by adding CO2 to control the  insects.</li>
        <li><strong>Seed purpose:</strong> Mix  1 kg of activated kaolin (or) lindane 1.3 D (or) malathion 5 D for every 100 kg  of seed and store/pack in gunny or polythene lined bags.</li>
        <li><strong>Grain purpose:</strong> Mix  1 kg activated kaolin for every 100 kg of grain and store. To protect the pulse  grains, mix activated kaolin at the above dosage or any one of the edible oils  at 1 kg for every 100 kg of grain or mix 1 kg of neem seed kernel for every 100  kg of cereal / pulse and store.</li>
        <li>Do  not mix synthetic insecticides with grains meant for consumption.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Cultural methods</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Split  and store pulses to escape from the attack by pulse beetle since it prefers to  attack whole pulses and not split ones.</li>
        <li>Store  the food grains in air tight sealed structures to prevent the infestation by  insects.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Mechanical methods</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sieve  and remove all broken grains to eliminate the condition which favour storage  pests.</li>
        <li>Stitch  all torn out bags before filling the grains.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Chemical methods</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Treat  the walls, dunnage materials and ceilings of empty godown with malathion 50 EC  10 ml/L (or) DDVP 76 WSC 7 ml/L1 at 3 Ll spray solution/10 sq.m.</li>
        <li>Treat  the alleyways and gangways with malathion 50 EC 10 ml/L or DDVP 76 WSC 7 ml/ L  (1 L of spray fluid/270 m3).</li>
        <li>Spray  malathion 50 EC 10 ml/ L with @ 3 L of spray fluid / 100 m2 over the  bags.</li>
        <li>Do  not spray the insecticides directly on food grains.</li>
        <li>Use  knock down chemicals like lindane smoke generator or fumigant strips pyrethrum  spray to kill the flying insects and insects on surfaces, cracks and crevices.</li>
        <li>Use  seed protectants like pyrethrum dust, carbaryl dust to mix with grains meant  for seed purposes only.</li>
        <li>Decide  the need for shed fumigation based on the intensity of infestation.</li>
        <li>Check  the black polythene sheets or rubberized aluminium covers for holes and get  them ready for fumigation.</li>
        <li>Use  EDB ampoules (available in different sizes 3 ml, 6 ml, 10 ml, 15 ml and 30 ml)  at 3 ml/quintal for wheat and pulses and 5 ml/ quintal for rice and paddy (Do  not recommend EDB for fumigation of flour oil seeds and moist grains)</li>
        <li>Use  EDCT (available in tin containers of 500 ml, 1 liter and 5 litres) at 30 – 40  litres/ 100 cubic meter in large scale storage and 55 ml/quintal in small scale  storage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong> FUMIGATION</strong><br />
      Use fumigants like  ethylene dibromide (EDB), ethylene dichloride carbon tetra chloride (EDCT),  aluminium phosphide (ALP) to control stored produce pests effectively. Apply  aluminum phosphide (available in 0.6 g and 3 gram tablets) @ 3 tablets (3 gram  each) per tonne of food grains lot with help of an applicator. Choose the  fumigant and work out the requirement based on the following guidelines.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>3 tablets of aluminum phosphide 3 g each per  tonne of grain.</li>
        <li>21 tablets of aluminium phosphide 3 g each  for 28 cubic meters</li>
        <li>Period of fumigation is 5 days</li>
      </ul>
      <p>            Mix clay or red earth with water and  make it into a paste form and keep it ready for plastering all round the  fumigation cover or keep ready sand snakes. Place the required number of  aluminium phosphide tablets in between the bags in different layer. Cover the  bags immediately with fumigation cover. Plaster the edges of cover all round  with wet red earth or clay plaster or weigh down with sand snakes to make leaf  proof. Keep the bags for a period of 5-7 days under fumigation based on  fumigant chosen. Remove the mud plaster after specified fumigation periods and  lift cover in the corner to allow the residual gas to escape. Lift the cover  after few hours to allow aeration.</p>
