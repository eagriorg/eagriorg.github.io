				<p>Factors  affecting ripening can be physiological, physical, or biotic. <br />
Physiological factors relate to fruit maturity or environmental factors,  which affect the metabolism of fruit and banana.<br />
Physical factors include mechanical damage, or relate to dimensions of  the fruit.<br />
Biotic factors include attack from pests and diseases.<br />
<strong>Fruit maturity.</strong> The more mature  fruit is at harvest, the shorter the ripening period. Studies show that  banana harvested 100 days after flowering  ripened in 11 days. When the same cultivar was harvested 90 days after  flowering, the ripening period increased to 15 days, and further increased to  22 days when the fruit was harvested at 80 days. Farmers have to match the date  of harvest with the transportation time to the market. However, an early  harvest reduces yield.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="553" height="354" src="lec04_clip_image001.png" alt=":::Screen Shot 2012-10-13 at 3.05.42 PM.png" /></p>
 <p>
As fruits mature, the cross-sectional diameter increases. Fruit  angularity also changes during growth and maturation. As fruits approach full  maturity, fruit angles become less acute Fruit angularity can be used to  predict the optimum harvest date of banana.<br />
<strong>Temperature.</strong> Physiological  studies on bananas show that storage life decreases as external temperature  increases over the range 15-35ºC. A 1ºC reduction increases storage period by  1-2 days.<br />
The relationship between ripening period and temperature is due to fruit  respiration. Fruit respiration depends on many enzymatic reactions, and the  rate of these reactions increases exponentially with increase in temperature.  Studies show that ripe fruits respire at approximately 4 times the rate of  unripe fruits. Consequently, ripe fruits lose sugar resources at a higher rate  than unripe fruits. This explains why ripe fruits deteriorate quickly.<br />
The relationship between temperature and respiration is described  mathematically by van't Hoff's temperature quotient (Q10). van't Hoff showed that the rate of respiration  approximately doubles for each 10ºC rise in temperature.<br />
<strong>Water loss and humidity.</strong> Where  fruit is sold on a weight basis, loss of water means economic loss.  Additionally, water loss reduces visual quality. Water loss causes fruit to  lose its firmness, the peel becomes soft and shriveled, and ripening period  reduces. Studies on fruits show a curvilinear or power relationship between  fruit weight loss and ripening period. For a 2% change from 2% to 4% weight  loss per day, ripening period reduced by 9 days or 50%. Therefore, at a low  rate of weight loss, a small increase in weight loss has a critical effect on  ripening.<br />
The rate of water loss depends on the ambient relative humidity (RH). RH  is the amount of water vapor present in the air, relative to the maximum amount  of water vapor that can be held in the air, at a given temperature, saturated  air being 100% RH. When a water-containing material such as fruit is placed in  an enclosed space, for example, a sealed container, the water content of the  air within the container increases or decreases until it is in equilibrium with  the fruit.<br />
The water equilibrium principle applies when fruit is stored. The rate  of water loss depends on the ambient RH. At an ambient RH of 95-100%, fruit  loses little or no moisture, and ripening period is unaffected. However, as  humidity decreases, the rate of water loss increases, and ripening period  reduces.<br />
Excessive wetting can also be a problem. When fruit is stored in wet  conditions, such as in moist coir (coconut fiber), the uptake of water from the  coir to the fruit leads to peel splitting.<br />
<strong>Sunlight.</strong> Exposure to direct sunlight  reduces the ripening period of fruits. Sunlight increases fruit temperature  above ambient temperature, which increases respiration, and possibly the rate  of water loss. The solar radiation that falls upon foods held  in direct sunlight increases the temperature above the ambient temperature. The  amount of increase in temperature depends on the intensity of the radiation,  the size and shape of the food' and the duration of exposure to the direct rays  of the sun. The intensity of solar radiation depends upon latitude, altitude,  season of the year, time of day, and degree of cloud cover.<br />
<strong><u>Altitude</u></strong>. Within a given latitude the prevailing temperature is dependent  upon the elevation when other factors are equal. There is on the average a drop  in temperature of 6.5°C for each Km increase in elevation above sea level.  Storing food at high altitudes will therefore tend to increase the storage life  and decrease the losses in food provided it is kept out of the direct rays of  the sun.</p>
				<p><strong><u>Atmosphere</u></strong>. The normal atmosphere contains by volume, approximately 78%  nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% argon, 0.03% carbon dioxide' various amounts of water  vapor and traces of inert gases. Modifying the atmosphere can improve the shelf  life and reduce wastage of certain foods.<br />
				  One type  of controlled atmosphere storage (CA) is refrigerated storage in which the  level of oxygen is reduced to about 3% with the carbon dioxide content being  raised to 1 to 5%, depending on the commodity. This CA storage may double the  storage life over that of regular cold storage for certain varieties of apples  and pears by slowing down the natural rate of respiration.<br />
				  Ethylene (C2H4) is a gaseous  plant hormone which determines the time between harvest and senescence. The  time from harvest to the climacteric respiratory response is called the 'green  life' or preclimacteric period. Ethylene shortens the preclimacteric period; at  high concentrations, ethylene causes rapid initiation of the climacteric  respiratory response and accelerates ripening.<br />
				  When nonclimacteric fruits are exposed to ethylene, fruits show an  increased rate of respiration. However, respiration rate falls when ethylene is  removed. A rise in respiration rate may occur more than once in nonclimacteric  fruits. However, for climacteric fruits, the climacteric is autocatalytic, that  is, once started, the process cannot be stopped until the fruit is ripe.<br />
				  Poor storage methods allow a build up of ethylene, stimulate the  climacteric response, and reduce the ripening period. For example, plastic  sheets placed over stacks of fruit for shade increase the level of ethylene  within the fruit stack and increase the rate of ripening. Therefore, store  fruit in thatched or ventilated areas to prevent the build up of ethylene.  Also, do not store unripe fruits with ripe fruits.<br />
				  During the preclimacteric period, fruits are less susceptible to  physical damage and pathological attack. This is the best time for handling,  transportation, and marketing.<br />
  <strong>Mechanical damage.</strong> Mechanical damage  is a physical factor affecting ripening. Fruit damage during handling generates  ethylene. If ethylene production is sufficient to start the climacteric  respiratory response, fruit immediately starts to ripen.<br />
				  Damage can also reduce ripening period by causing moisture loss. The  effect of damage can easily be measured by recording fruit weight loss over  time. Cuts and abrasions on the surface membrane cause the most weight loss.<br />
				  After harvest, fruits lose the ability to repair ruptured peel.  Harvesting techniques which damage fruit reduce storability.<br />
				  Studies show that an abrasion affecting 5-10% of the peel can reduce the  ripening period by 40%. Damage can also lead to secondary infection, which increases  the rate of water loss and further reduces quality.<br />
  <strong>Surface to volume ratio.</strong> The ratio  between surface area and volume determines the rate of water loss. The greater  the surface to volume ratio, the shorter the postharvest life. A leaf which has  two large surfaces with little volume loses moisture faster than a fruit. Large  fruits lose less water than small fruits.<br />
  <strong>Peel thickness.</strong> Fruits with thin  peel lose more water. A higher peel permeability leads to a higher rate of  water loss and a faster ripening rate. Also, fruits with thick peel, for  example melons, withstand damage better than fruits with thin peel, such as  tomatoes.<br />
  <strong>Stomatal density. </strong>A higher density  of stomata may cause a higher rate of water loss, which accelerates ripening. <br />
  <strong>Biotic  stress.</strong> Fungi, bacteria,  viruses, and insects also account for a considerable proportion of total  postharvest loss. Pests and diseases reduce both ripening period and overall  quality. However, attack by pests and diseases is often secondary because a  pest exploits a damaged area of the fruit. Careful fruit handling often  prevents such attacks. </p>
