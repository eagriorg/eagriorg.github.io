				<p align="center"><strong>SPOILAGE  OF CANNED PRODUCTS - BIOCHEMICAL, ENZYMATIC AND MICROBIAL SPOILAGE</strong><br />
                    <strong>SPOILAGE  OF CANNED PRODUCTS </strong><br />
                    <strong>Enzymatic  spoilage </strong> <br />
                    <p>Many  reactions in plant and animal tissues are activated by enzymes. The changes in  foods during storage can be produced both by enzymes present in the food or by  enzymes from microorganisms that contaminate the food. A good example of the  former is the ripening of banana due to the enzymes present which hasten the  ripening process. After some time the fruit become too soft and unfit to eat.  If there is a bruised spot on the fruit, yeasts can grow and produce enzymes  which spoil the fruit.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Enzymes convert starch into sugars, protein into amino acids, and pectin into  pectic acids and thus change the constituents of food. Some fruits and  vegetables turn brown when damaged or when their cut surfaces are exposed to  air due to the presence of the enzymes phenolase, peroxidase and polyphenol  oxidase. Their actions can be easily controlled by regulating the temperature and  excluding moisture and air. Enzyme can act between zero and 60oC.  the optimum temperature of reaction is usually 37oC, the rate  varying directly with temperature. All enzymes are inactivated at 80oC.<strong></strong><br />
  <strong>Microbial  spoilage </strong><strong> </strong><br />
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Bacteria,  yeasts and moulds may infect food after harvesting, during its handling,  processing and storage. But not all microorganisms cause spoilage, e.g., lactic  acid bacteria are used in the making of cheese and other fermented dairy  products, yeasts for the production of wine and beer and <em>Acetobacter </em>bacteria  for vinegar production. Spoilage organisms are present everywhere- in soil,  air, water and even in the raw and processed food.<br />
  <strong>(i)  Bacteria</strong> <br />
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>These  are unicellular microorganisms that are classed as plants though they do not  contain chlorophyll. A bacterial cell is about I m in length and somewhat  smaller in diameter. Bacteria are classified according to their shape. Cocci  are spherical, bacilli are cylindrical and spirilla and vibrios are spiral.  Bacterial spores are more resistant than yeast or mould spores to most  processing conditions. Bacteria, with a few exceptions, cannot grow in acid  media in which yeasts and moulds thrive. They multiply by ‘fission’ or division  of cells. When a bacterium becomes mature it divides into two, these two become  four and so on. The growth of bacteria is very rapid and depends upon the  nature of the food material, moisture, temperature and air. Some bacteria do  not grow in air but temperature plays a major role in their growth, the optimum  being generally 37oC.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Some bacteria produce spores which can be destroyed by heating at 121oC  for 30-40 minutes. Bacteria are very sensitive to acids and are destroyed in  their presence even at the temperature of boiling water. Hence, most fruits  being acidic can be easily sterilized at 100oC whereas vegetables  being non-acidic require a higher temperature of 116oC. The  important groups of bacteria are:<br />
  <strong>(a)  Bacillus:&nbsp; </strong>rod-shaped;<br />
  <strong>(b)  Coccus:&nbsp; </strong>spherical;<br />
  <strong>(c)  Coccobacillus:&nbsp; </strong>oval-shaped; <br />
  <strong>(d)  Aerobes :</strong>require atmospheric oxygen for growth, e.g., <em>Acetobacter  aceti;</em><br />
  <strong>(e)  Facultative anaerobes: </strong>can grow with or without atmospheric  oxygen;<br />
  <strong>(f)  Obligate anaerobes: </strong>do not grow in atmospheric oxygen;<br />
  <strong>(g)  Mesophiles: </strong>require a temperature below 38oC  for growth;<br />
  <strong>(h)  Obligate thermophiles: </strong>grow between 38 and 82oC;<br />
  <strong>(i)  Facultative thermophiles: </strong>grow over the whole range of temperature  covered by&nbsp;mesophiles and obligate thermophiles and below; and  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  <strong>(j)  Psychrotrophs: </strong>grow fairly well at refrigeration  temperatures and some can even grow slowly at temperature below freezing. <br />

				<p><strong>Some useful bacteria </strong><br />
                    <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>The  following bacteria are of great importance in the food processing industry.<br />
                    <strong>Acetobacter  sp.</strong> <br />
                    <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>These  bacteria, also known as “Vinegar bacteria”, cause significant spoilage in the  wine industry but are necessary for vinegar production. The important species  are <em>Acetobacter aceti, </em>A. <em>orleansis</em> and A. <em>Schutzenbachi.</em> They are very small, usually non-motile and generally do not form spores. These  bacteria are aerobes and in the presence of oxygen convert ethyl alcohol to  acetic acid. They are of two types-one type forms a tough shiny film on the  surface of wine and the growth is known as “vinegar mother”, while the other  grows throughout the wine without forming “vinegar mother”. These bacteria can  be easily destroyed by heating to 65oC.<br />
                    <strong>Lactobacillus </strong><strong>sp.</strong> <br />
                    <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Different  organisms of this group, also known as “lactic acid bacteria”, have different  properties but all of them produce lactic acid from carbohydrates. Those which  are used in distilling and brewing industries are facultative thermophiles  (heat-tolerants) which grow abundantly at 50 to 55oC and produce  much lactic acid. Mesophiles are used in the preparation of pickles. <em>Lactobacillus  plantarum</em> is generally found in pickles and olives. The other important  species are <em>Pediococcus cerevisiae, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus  faecalis </em>and<em> Lactobacillus brevis. </em>These bacteria cause “lactic  souring” and spoil wines, which can be easily prevented by maintaining a  sulphur dioxide concentration of 0.007 per cent in wine. <br />
                    <strong>(ii)  Yeasts</strong> <br />
                    <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Yeasts  are unicellular fungi which are widely distributed in nature. They are somewhat  larger than bacteria. The cell length is about 10 m and the diameter is about  a third of this. Most yeasts are spherical or ellipsoidal. Yeasts that multiply  by means of ‘budding’ are known as ‘true yeasts’. The bud when it becomes  mature separates from the mother cell and functions like an independent  organism. Yeasts grow luxuriantly at a moderate temperature in a solution of  sugar in plenty of water. Under suitable conditions the sugar is converted into  alcohol and carbon dioxide gas is evolved. <br />
                    <img width="49" height="12" src="lec16_clip_image001.gif" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yeast + Sugar                Alcohol + Carbon dioxide ­<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This is the reason that carbon dioxide is evolved from food materials spoiled  by yeasts and pushes out corks from bottles with great force. Active  fermentation can be easily recognized by the formation of carbon dioxide foams  or bubbles. Yeasts prefer a low concentration of sugar for their growth. Most  of them do not develop in media containing more than 66% sugar or 0.5% acetic  acid. Boiling destroys the yeast cells and spores completely. Some of the yeasts  which grow on fruits are <em>Saccharomyces, Candida </em>and <em>Brettanomyces.</em><br />
  <strong>Pseudo-yeasts</strong><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  These are like true yeasts but do not form spores. All the members of this  group are particularly unsuitable for fermentation purposes as they produce  off-flavours and cloudiness. <br />

				<p>&nbsp; <strong>(iii) Moulds </strong><br />
                    <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Moulds  are multicellular, filamentous fungi belonging to the division Thallophyta but  are devoid of chlorophyll. They are larger than yeasts. They are strict aerobes  and require oxygen for growth and multiplication and tend to grow more slowly  than bacteria. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The principal parts of a mould are a web-like structure known as mycelium and  the spore. The mycelium is often white and cottony and penetrates into the  attacked foodstuff. After fixing itself the mould produces viable spores which  resist the unfavourable conditions after dispersal and germinate when they get  favourable conditions. They thrive best in closed, damp and dark situations  with an adequate supply of warm, moist air but require less free moisture than  yeasts and bacteria. They  prefer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  sugar-containing substances and may spoil jams, jellies, preserves and other  sugar-based products. Acid medium favours their growth and, therefore, they  grow well in pickles, juices, etc. This is the main reason that fruits and  fruit products are attacked by moulds which not only consume nutrients present  in the food thereby lowering its food value but also spoil the flavour, texture  and appearance of the product. They may grow even on moist leather but do not  thrive in an alkaline medium. Moulds are sensitive to heat; boiling quickly  destroys both moulds and their spores. The most important moulds are; <br />
				  a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Penicillium </em>sp. (Blue  moulds),<br />
				  b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Aspergillus </em>sp.  (Black moulds),<br />
				  c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Mucor </em>sp. (Gray  moulds), and <br />
				  d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Byssochlamys fulva</em> <br />
  <strong>a.  Penicillium sp.</strong> <br />
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>These  are also known as blue moulds. In the initial stage of growth they have a  cottony appearance but later when the spores or conidia are formed, their  appearance becomes powdery and the colour becomes blue, brown or pink according  to age. The spoiled materials have a ‘mouldy’ odour and flavour. <br />
  <strong>b. Aspergillus sp.</strong> <br />
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>In  the initial stages of growth it is white and cottony like <em>Penicillium</em> but later with the formation of spores, it becomes black and is hence known as  “black mould”. Unlike <em>Penicillium</em> it does not produce off-odour and  flavour. They generally attacks grapes and bael.<br />
  <strong>(c) Mucor sp.</strong> <br />
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>It  is gray in colour and hence is known as ‘gray mould’. It is also known as ‘pin  mould’ or bread mould’ because if frequently grows on moist bread. Although <em>Mucor </em>attacks fruits, in the preservation of fruits and vegetables it does not  pose a serious problem like blue and black moulds. <br />
  <strong>(d) Byssochlamys fulva</strong> <br />
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>This  mould causes spoilage of canned fruits. The infected fruits disintegrate and  sometimes carbon dioxide gas is also produced. It can grow under reduced oxygen  tension and the ascospores posses high resistance to heat. For destroying  spores heating of the cans at 88 to 90oC is essential. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Although the organism is not as resistant as some of the thermophiles, its  control in canned foods is difficult. Canned products which cannot withstand  prolonged heating without deterioration are ultimately spoiled. Association of  this mould with fruit in the field has been observed. Hence the emphasis should  be on eliminating the organism from the raw material itself instead of  processing to destroy it in the can.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A small number of moulds produce toxic substances, known as mycotoxins, in  food. <em>Aspergillus flavus</em> produces aflatoxins in harvested crops, such as  groundnut, which are stored in the field without drying properly. </p>
