				<p align="center"><strong>Chapter 8: Methods of storage-precooling, pre storage  treatments, low temperature storage, controlled atmosphere storage, hypobaric  storage, irradiation and low cost storage structures</strong><br />
			    <p> Pre-cooling is the key component in the preservation of quality for perishable  fresh produce in post-harvest systems. It is  likely the most important of all the operations used in the maintenance of  desirable, fresh and salable produce. Precooling is defined as the removal of  field heat from freshly harvested produce in order to slow down metabolism and  reduce deterioration prior to transport or storage. One  of the most important factors affecting the  postharvest life and quality of fruits and vegetables is temperature. Quality loss after harvest occurs as  a result of physiological and biological processes, the rates of which are  influenced primarily by product temperature. As the maintenance of market  quality is of vital importance to the success of the horticultural industry, it  is necessary not only to cool the product but to cool it as quickly as possible  after harvest. <br />
				  Pre-cooling rapidly lowers  the temperature of freshly harvested produce and is done immediately following  harvest to minimize spoilage. It is the first operation in the cold chain and  is essential for produce (fruits and vegetables) as they are perishable in  nature. Although produce may be pre-cooled in a  cold storage facility, pre-cooling differs from cold storage. In cold storage,  the temperature is simply maintained at a predetermined low temperature. If the  cold storage facility is to double as a pre-cooling facility, higher  refrigeration capacity is required as well as appropriate provisions for  pre-cooling and handling of the produce. The main  beneficiary of precooling is the grower as it allows him to sell the produce at  the most appropriate time and at the competitive price. Consumers and general  economy also benefit through adoption of proper post harvest handling  procedures through improved shelf quality, lower real costs for fruits and  vegetables through the reduction of losses and spoilage.<br />
  <strong>Proper pre-cooling preserves product quality by</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>inhibiting the growth of decay producing microorganisms</li>
				  <li> restricting enzymatic and  respiratory activity</li>
				  <li> inhibiting water loss</li>
				  <li> reducing ethylene  production</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>The importance of precooling</strong><br />
                    <strong>(i) Importance of lag  time between harvest and cooling</strong><br />
                  <img width="367" height="220" src="lec08_clip_image003.gif" /><br clear="all" />
				  Field  heat can cause rapid deterioration of some horticultural crops and therefore it  is desirable to remove this heat as quickly as possible after harvesting. When  it comes to produce quality, every minute counts and that precooling is among  the most cost-effective and effcient quality preservation methods available to  commercial crop produces. For example, strawberries experience increasing  deterioration losses as delays between harvesting and cooling exceeds 1 h  and the effects of the delay on cooling of  strawberries is shown in Fig.1.<br />
				  Fig.1. Effect of delay  before cooling on the quality of Shasta strawberries</p>
				<p>From this it can be seen  that even after a short time of 2 h at 300C, only 80% of the  strawberries are considered marketable fruit, which represents an apparent loss  of approximately 10% by not cooling the produce immediately after picking. Furthermore, precooling slows down the deterioration and  the rotting process by retarding the growth of decay organisms, and it reduces  wilting since transpiration and evaporation occurs more slowly at low  temperatures. <br />
                    <strong>(ii) Influence of  precooling on the respiration rate</strong><br />
				  The rate of deterioration  after harvest is closely related to the respiration rate of the harvested  product, therefore the reduction of respiration rate is essential to preserving  market quality. Since the rate of respiration is influenced by temperature ,  precooling to remove the field heat before storage will reduce the respiration  rate and hence deterioration will decline accordingly. For example reduction in temperature of 9.50C in  grapes halved the rate of respiration and doubled their keeping quality.<br />
  <strong>(iii) Influence on  metabolism</strong><br />
				  The  increase in the rate of deterioration is related to the metabolic processes of  the crop. Within the plants temperature range, the rate of deterioration  increases logarithmically with increasing temperature. Metabolic rates double  for each 100C rise in temperature. From these reports, it can be  seen that the quicker the temperature is reduced the less losses that can  occur. Hence, precooling is essential in order to reduce metabolic changes such  as enzyme activity, and to slow the maturation of perishable produce.<br />
  <strong>(iv) Effects of rapid cooing  on ethylene</strong><br />
				  The reduction in temperature  has the added advantage of reducing the production and sensitivity of the  produce to ethylene that accelerates ripening and senescence. Therefore, the  faster and more promptly the field heat and hence temperature is reduced after  harvest, the quicker these deteriorative processes are retarded and hence the  more of the initial quality can be maintained.<br />
  <strong>Methods  for Precooling Produce</strong><br />
				  There are  seven principal methods of pre-cooling fresh produce:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Room cooling</li>
				  <li>Forced-air cooling</li>
				  <li>Hydro-cooling</li>
				  <li>Ice cooling</li>
				  <li>Vacuum cooling</li>
				  <li>Cryogenic cooling</li>
				  <li>Evaporative cooling </li>
			    </ol>
				<p>Considerable loss in quality and shelf life can occur as  a result of holding harvested produce in the field before pre-cooling. All  methods require sufficient refrigeration capacity to reduce the temperature of  the produce within the required time plus the ability to remove the normal heat  gain in the facility. <br />
                    <strong>1) Room cooling</strong><br />
                  <img width="503" height="345" src="lec08_clip_image005.gif" /><br clear="all" />
				  Precooling  produce in a cold-storage room or precooling room is an old well-established  practice . This widely used method involves the placing of produce in boxes  (wooden, fiberboard or plastic), bulk containers or various other packages into  a cold room, where they are exposed to cold air. It is used for produce sensitive to free moisture or  surface moisture. Because this type of cooling is slow, room cooling is only  appropriate for very small amounts of produce or produce that does not  deteriorate rapidly.<br />
  <strong>Fig.2. Room cooling</strong></p>
				<p>Typically  the cold air is discharged into the room near the ceiling, and sweeps past the  produce containers to return to the heat exchangers. The cooled air is  generally supplied by forced or induced draft coolers, consisting of framed,  closely spaced and finned evaporator coils fitted with fans to circulate the air  over the coils. Therefore, as to achieve fast and efficient cooling, care  should be taken that the correct packaging (well vented) or containers and  stacking patterns are used. Air velocities around the packages  should be at least 60 m/min to provide the necessary turbulence to achieve heat  removal and therefore attain adequate cooling. As much of the cooling is  achieved by conduction, room cooling gives a slow and variable temperature  reduction, therefore perishable produce used in this method must be tolerant of  slow heat removal. A conventional cold  store is unsuited for this operation because as much as three-quarters of the  refrigerator capacity may be required simply to remove field heat and the  cooling rates are frequently no better than 0.50C/h. The rooms  commonly used for highly perishable fruit are designed to have an airflow rate  of about 170 to 225 m3/min for a room with a capacity of 15,000 kg  and sufficient refrigeration so as to cool the fruit to 50C in  approximately 12 h. Containers are stacked  individually so that cold air from the ceiling blows over or around the produce  to contact all surfaces of the containers.</p>
				<p>Produce will dry out if a high relative humidity  (90-95 percent) is not maintained. Containers should be well vented so as much  air as possible can circulate through them. Spacing between the containers and  walls must be from 6 to 12 inches, and between the boxes and ceiling, 18 to 24  inches. Room cooling is not recommended for bulk bins because they contain a  much greater mass of produce than smaller containers. Proper design of the  cooling room and refrigeration equipment is necessary for room cooling to work  efficiently. The refrigeration equipment must be capable of cooling down fresh  produce within 24 hours and of maintaining the storage temperature of the  produce. Normally, much larger refrigeration equipment is needed to cool down  the produce than to maintain the produce at a cool temperature. Room cooling  has become increasingly difficult as more commodities are being handled in  larger quantities and are packaged immediately after harvest due to bettermechanization. These  difficulties coupled with its slow and variable cooling extend the cold chain  and therefore reduce the product life in subsequent storage.<br />
                  <strong>2) Forced air cooling</strong><br />
Forced air cooling was  developed to accommodate products requiring relatively rapid removal of field  heat immediately after harvest. Forced air or pressure cooling is a  modification of room cooling and is accomplished by exposing packages of  produce to higher air pressure on one side than on the other. This technique  involves definite stacking patterns and the baffling of stacks so that the  cooling air is forced through (rather than around) the individual containers.  For successful forced air cooling operations, it is required that containers  with vent holes be placed in the direction of the moving air and packaging  materials that would interfere with free movement of air through the containers  should be minimized. A relatively small  pressure difference between the two sides of the containers exists, resulting  in good air movement and excellent heat transfer and hence faster cooling.<br />
Produce can be cooled by a  variety of different forced air cooling arrangements. These include (a) air  circulated at high velocity in refrigerated rooms, (b) by forcing air through  the voids in bulk products as it moves through a cooling tunnel on continuous  conveyors, and (c) by encouraging forced airflow through packed produce by the  pressure differential technique. Each of these methods is used commercially,  and each is suited for certain commodities when properly applied. The product  cooling rate is affected by numerous variables and, therefore, the overall cost  of the forced air cooling will vary. These variables include product size and  shape; thermal properties; product configuration (bulk or packaged); carton  vent area; depth of product load during cooling; initial product temperature;  final desired product temperature and airflow rate, temperature, and relative  humidity.<br />
The cooling rate in a given  system depends primarily on the velocity of the cold air flowing through it,  and this is the only controlling factor, since no change can be made in certain  fixed factors such as size, shape and thermal properties of the produce. In  addition, the temperature of the cold air cannot be reduced below a certain  safe point to avoid chilling injury. In general, the cool air necessary for  this type of cooling can be generated from (a) direct expansion refrigeration  system, (b) ice bank cooling system and (c) water cascade. Forced air coolers  utilise centrifugal (commonly known as squirrel cage) or axial fans which push  the cold air around the system. Fans are selected based on the criteria of  required airflow and static pres-sure. These requirements are influenced by the  type of produce and quantity being cooled, the arrangement of the produce  (bulk, boxes or stacking) and the cooling rate required. Differential pressures in use are approximately 0.6 to  7.5 mbar with air flows ranging from 0.001 to 0.003 m3/s kg product. <img width="576" height="217" src="lec08_clip_image002.gif" /><br clear="all" />
<strong>Fig.3. </strong><strong>Forced  horizontal air flow</strong>                                         <strong>Fig.4. Forced vertical air flow</strong> <br />
The  air can be channeled to flow either horizontally or vertically. In a horizontal  flow system, the air is forced to flow horizontally from one side of the pallet  load to the other through holes in the sides of the pallet bin or containers.  Only two sides that are opposite can be open in the pallet bin or containers.  In stacking containers, the side holes must line up for the air to pass from  one side of the stack to the other. In this system, the top and bottom of the  pallet or containers must be sealed to prevent air from by passing the produce.<br />
In a  vertical flow system, the air is forced to flow vertically from the bottom to  the top of the pallet through holes in the bottom of the pallet, and containers  if used, then out the top. In this system, the sides must be sealed to prevent  the air from bypassing the produce. Also, if containers are used, the holes in  the tops and bottoms of the containers must line up, so the air can travel  vertically from one container to the next. This method is faster than room  cooling because a flow of chilled air is in direct contact with the produce. In  these systems, condensation on the produce can be minimized by a simple cover  placed on top of the stack of containers, which prevents the entry of ambient  air during handling.<br />
The key  to forced-air cooling is moving the cold air through the container and its  contents. Important factors in container ventilation are location of container  vents, stacking of containers, and size of the vents. Container vents should be  aligned whether the containers are straight-stacked or crossstacked, to  maximize air flow through the containers. If vents are too small or too few,  air flow is slowed. If there are too many, the container may collapse. In this  method, containers are stacked close together (tight). Five percent vent-hole  space per side and/or end is best. Liners, bags, wrappers, or dividers can slow  the flow of air through the container, so precooling produce is usually  recommended prior to additional packing. The following are forced-air cooling  alternatives.<br />
<img width="72" height="12" src="lec08_clip_image003_0000.gif" /><strong>Cold Wall</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>A  permanent false wall or air plenum contains an exhaust fan that draws air from  the room and directs it over the cooling surface. The wall is at the same end  of the cold room as the cooling surface. The wall is built with a damper system  that only opens when containers with openings are placed in front of it. The  fan pulls cold room air through the container and contents, cooling the  produce.<br />

                    <strong>            </strong>An  exhaust fan is placed at the end of the aisle of two rows of containers or bins  on pallets. The aisle top and ends are covered with plastic or canvas, creating a tunnel. An exhaust fan draws cool room  air through the container vents and top . The exhaust fan may be  portable, creating a single forced-air tunnel where needed, or it may be part  of a stationary wall adjacent to the cooling surface, with several fans that  create several tunnels.</p>

                    <strong>            </strong>A  serpentine system is designed for bulk bin cooling. It is a modification of the  cold-wall method. Bulk bins have vented bottoms with or without side ventilation.  Bins are stacked several high and several deep with the fork lift openings  against the cold wall. Every other forklift opening—sealed with canvas—in the  stack matches a cold wall opening. The alternate unsealed forklift opening  allows cold air to circulate through the produce. Cold room air is drawn  through the produce via the alternate unsealed openings in the stack and the  top of the bin.<br />

                  Fig.7.  Serpentine Cooling</p>
                <p>            Because  the cooling air comes in direct contact with the product being cooled, cooling  is much faster than with conventional room cooling. Cooling by the forced air  method was usually 4 to 10 times faster than room cooling but that hydrocooling and vacuum cooling was 2 to 23  times faster than forced air cooling. Another aspect of forced air cooling is  that converting existing facilities is often simple and inexpensive, provided  that sufficient refrigeration capacity and cooling surfaces are available. When  very rapid cooling is required forced air cooling is more costly than other precooling  methods, and therefore this may limit its application to some produce which  needs to be cooled extremely quickly. Another drawback of forced air cooling is  that it requires a definite stacking pattern hence this technique requires  skilled operators so as to achieve the required loading pattern to ensure  satisfactory cooling rates.<br />
                    <strong>3) Hydrocooling</strong><br />
                  Hydrocooling essentially is  the utilization of chilled or cold water for lowering the temperature of a  product in bulk or smaller containers before further packing. Hydrocooling is  achieved by flooding, spraying, or immersing the product in/with chilled water.  There are several different hydrocooler designs in  operation commercially. Hydrocooling methods differ in their cooling  rates and overall process efficiencies. Differences  between the individual techniques are evident by the method of cooling and by  the way that produce is moved or placed in the cooler. Various  types of hydrocooler are available, some of which include conventional (flood)  type, immersion type, and batch type. The  flood type hydrocooler cools the packaged product by flooding as it is conveyed  through a cooling tunnel. With the batch system, chilled water is sprayed over  the product for a certain length of time, depending on the season and the  incoming product temperature. These hydrocoolers have a smaller capacity than  conventional hydrocoolers and are therefore less expensive. A frequent  complaint about both conventional and batch type hydrocoolers is that cooling  by these techniques is not uniformly and hence may leave `hot spots' throughout  the load. For hydrocooling to be effective, contact between the water and the  product surface must be uniform. This may not be achieved by these design of  hydrocoolers as the chilled water may not be evenly distributed throughout the  load, resulting in undercooling of some parts. The bulk or immersion type  cooler uses a combination of immersion and flood cooling. Loose produce is  immersed in cold water, and remains immersed until an inclined conveyor  gradually lifts the products out of the water and moves it through an overhead  shower. The most rapid hydrocooling is obtained by this cooling technique. It  is nearly twice as rapid as conventional hydrocooling methods, due to the fact  that moving chilled water completely surrounds the exterior surface of the  produce and hence facilitates quicker temperature reduction. The bulk type  cooler has the added benefit over the flood type cooler of allowing greater  packaging flexibility, i.e. packaging after cooling, and therefore it may be  more suitable to a wide range of growers.</p>
                <p>In general products  hydrocooled should tolerate being wetted and not be damaged by falling water or  disinfectants that it may contain, hence hydrocooling is recommended for  produce for which washing is part of their market preparation. A risk  associated with most hydrocoolers is the decay hazard associated with  recirculated water, which leads to the possibility of decay producing organisms  accumulating in the system, resulting in the contamination of the cooled  produce. To prevent this from occurring, mild disinfectant such as chlorine at  concentrations of 100 ppm (measured as hypochlorus acid) or approved phenol  compounds are used and therefore produce cooled by this technique must not be  affected by the use of these chemicals. One of the chief benefits of  hydrocooling is that it is seen to prevent loss of moisture during the cooling  process. Another advantage of this technique is that it is very  rapid in contrast to other pre-cooling techniques available. Field heat can be  removed in 20-30 min using hydrocooling instead of several hours normally  needed for forced air-cooling. Hydro-air cooling is an important and  specialized area of hydrocooling in which a mixture of refrigerated air and water  in a fine mist spray is circulated around and through stacks of the produce.  The advantage of hydro-air cooling is the reduced water requirements and the  potential for improved sanitation. In hydro-air cooling the ratio of air-water  influences the heat transfer capability of the cooling system and the  applicability of certain products to this technique.</p>

				  Fig.9.  Cut-away side view of a continuous-flow immersion hydrocooler</p>
				<p>Shower coolers distribute water using a perforated metal pan that  is flooded with cold water from the refrigeration evaporator. Shower type  coolers can be built with a moving conveyor for continuous flow operation or  they can be operated in a batch mode. Immersion coolers are suited for product  that sinks in water. They usually cool slower than shower coolers because water  flows at slower rates past the product. </h1>
				<p>Water  is a better heat-transfer medium than air and, consequently, hydrocoolers cool  produce much faster than forced-air coolers. In well-designed shower coolers,  small diameter produce, like cherries, cool in less than 10 min. Large diameter  products like melons cool in 45 to 60 min. Immersion coolers usually have  longer cooling times than shower coolers because water speed past produce is  slower. Packages for hydro-cooled produce must allow  vertical water flow and must tolerate water contact. Plastic or wood containers  work well in hydrocoolers. Corrugated fiberboard must be wax-dipped to  withstand water contact. Hydro-coolers cause no moisture loss in  cooling. In fact, they can rehydrate slightly wilted product. </h1>
				<p><strong>4) Ice cooling </strong><br />
				  In ice cooling, crushed or fine granular ice is used to cool the produce.  The ice is either packed around produce in cartons or sacks, or it is made into  a slurry with water and injected into waxed cartons packed with produce. The  ice then fills the voids around the produce.  Before the advent of comparatively  modern precooling techniques, contact or package icing was used extensively for  precooling produce and maintaining temperature during transit. Although, unlike  other cooling methods ice not only removes heat rapidly when first applied, it  continues to absorb heat as it melts. There are a variety of different methods  in which ice is applied to the produce so as to achieve the desired cooling  effect. <br />
				  Package  icing involves direct placement of slush, flaked, or crushed ice over the  product in shipment containers. This method is sufficient where it is used;  however, it can result in uneven cooling because the ice generally remains  where it was placed until it has melted. In liquid icing, ice slurry is used  instead of plain crushed ice as it can sustain cooling requirements better. Liquid icing may be considered a hybrid of package icing  and hydrocooling. The simplest form of liquid icing is where a  mixture of water and finely crushed ice is pumped into open containers  travelling along a conveyor under an injection nozzle. If produce has been  packed and palletised in the field, the liquid ice can be injected into the  packages through vents or hand openings. Liquid-icing distributes the ice  throughout the commodity, i.e. placed in each individual package better, thus  achieving improved ice/produce contact and hence better and more uniform  cooling. Another method of icing is top icing, or placing ice on top of packed  containers. This is only used occasionally to supplement another cooling  method. Because corrugated containers have largely replaced wooden crates, the  use of top icing has decreased. Wax-impregnated corrugated containers have  allowed the use of icing of products after packaging to continue; however, it  is being replaced by hydrocooling and vacuum cooling.<br />
				  The major advantage of icing  is that produce does not dry as it is cooled. Another advantage is that in  addition to removing field heat, package icing can maintain low product  temperature during transit and therefore refrigerated transportation may not be  necessary for short transport duration. Although icing requires relatively  small outlays of special equipment, a large weight of ice must be shipped, thus  increasing costs, and also water-proof containers which are more expensive than  normal are required for this cooling technique. Another ambiguity of icing is that icing wets the produce and thus the  surface of warm wet produce provides an excellent site for post-harvest  diseases and soft rots. Therefore, it is essential that produce be not allowed  to rewarm once it is iced. Another drawback of this method of pre-cooling is  that after the ice has melted, the package is left only partly full. Ice cooling is faster than hydrocooling because contact with the  produce is good, and ice has a higher heat removal capacity than water. As in  hydro-cooling, ice cooling requires particular attention to water quality and  sanitation. <br />
  <strong>5) Vacuum cooling</strong><br />
				  Rapid cooling of  horticultural produce can be carried out with vacuum cooling. Vacuum cooling is  achieved by the evaporation of moisture from the produce. The evaporation is  encouraged and made more efficient by reducing the pressure to the point where  boiling of water takes place at a low temperature.<br />
  <strong>The basic principles of  the vacuum cooling process are described as follows:</strong><br />
				  1. At atmospheric  pressure (1013 mbar), the boiling temperature of water is 1000C.  This boiling point changes as a function of saturation pressure therefore at  23.37 mbar the water boiling temperature will be 200C and at 6.09  mbar, it will be 00C.<br />
				  2. To change from the  liquid to vapour state, the latent heat of vaporization must be provided by the  surrounding medium, so that the sensible heat of the product is reduced.<br />
				  3. The water vapour  given off by the product must be removed.<br />

  <strong>Key components  of a 20-pallet capacity vacuum cooler</strong></p>
				<p>In the vacuum cooling  process the pressure in the vacuum chamber is reduced from atmospheric to about  20 mbar and, during this time, evaporation is slow and relatively little  cooling takes place, i.e. temperature of the produce remains constant until  saturation pressure at this temperature is reached. At approximately this  pressure the `flash point' occurs; this is the point where the water in the  produce begins to vapourise, i.e. produce begins to lose moisture and cool  rapidly . For example, if the produce had an  ambient field heat of 200C then the `flash point' would occur at 24  mbar. At  this point the wet bulb temperature sharply increases as the air in the tank is  evacuated and is replaced by the evaporated water vapour. This vapour has to be  removed quickly in order to keep the overall cooling cycle to a reasonably  length, and this is accomplished by the use of a condenser in the chamber. The  pressure is further reduced and cooling continues until a pressure  corresponding to the desired final saturation temperature is reached. In  practice, most operators do not reduce the pressure below 6.09 mbar (saturation  pressure corresponding to a temperature 00C because of the extra  work involved and because of the freezing potential at reduced pressures.<br />
				  The heat required to  vaporize this water is removed from the product surface, hence the cooling rate  is limited by heat and mass transfer , i.e. evaporation rate of water from the  products surface and inner tissues. Therefore the rate of cooling depends  primarily upon the ratio of surface area of the product to its weight or  volume, the ease with which water is given up from the product tissues , the  rate of vacuum drawn in the flash chamber and the temperature of the load at  the start . Many investigations agree that vacuum cooling of fresh produce by the  rapid evaporation of water from the product works best with products having a  high ratio of surface to volume. Since water is seen as the primary  refrigerant, it is a safe assumption that the quantity of heat removed from the  product is directly related to the amount of water evaporated off the products  surface.</p>
				<p>Vacuum cooling is greatly influenced by the surface  area to mass ratio and the ease with which water is released from the products  tissues. Large temperature gradients develop in products with a low surface  area to mass ratio. In order to prevent surface freezing before the product is  cooled to the required temperature, a ``bouncing'' procedure is practised. This  is accomplished by switching the vacuum pump off and on to keep the saturation  temperature above freezing. One disadvantage of vacuum cooling is that it  causes weight loss in the produce being cooled due to the removal of moisture. Temperature reductions average 5 to 5.50C for  each 1% of weight loss, regardless of the product cooled. This small loss in  weight is usually acceptable in the products that are cooled by this technique.  A way of reducing this loss is by spraying free  water on to the product before it is placed into the cooling chamber. Special  vacuum cooler `hydrovac' have been developed, which have a built-in water spray  activated towards the end of the cooling operation and thus minimizes weight  loss. The rapid cooling</p>
				<p>achievable by the use of  vacuum cooling makes it more appealable and gives it a distinct advantage over  other cooling techniques. Examples of its speed of removing heat are given  previously. Another advantage is that vacuum cooling can achieve uniform  cooling throughout a package or lot of produce, provided the package or box is  not hermetically sealed to allow free evaporation. <br />
                  <strong>6) Cryogenic cooling</strong><br />
The use  of the latent heat of evaporation of liquid nitrogen or solid CO2  (dry ice) can produce `boiling' temperatures of -196 and -780C,  respectively. This is the basis of cryogenic precooling. In cryogenic cooling,  the produce is cooled by conveying it through a tunnel in which the liquid  nitrogen or solid CO2 evaporates. However, at the above temperatures  the produce will freeze and thus be ruined as a fresh market product. This  problem is prevented by careful control of the evaporation rate and conveyor  speed. Cryogenic cooling is relatively cheap to install but expensive to run.  Its main application is in cooling crops such as soft fruits, which have a  seasonal production period. Hence, by using cryogenic cooling the grower would  not incur the high capital costs associated with alternative cooling techniques  over such period of use. The high cost of liquid nitrogen, dry ice and other  suitable non-toxic refrigerants make this process most suitable for relatively  expensive products.<br />
<strong>7) Evaporative Cooling</strong><br />
Evaporative  cooling is an inexpensive and effective method of lowering produce temperature.  It is most effective in areas where humidity is low. Dry air is drawn through  moist padding or a fine mist of water, then through vented containers of  produce. As water changes from liquid to vapor, it absorbs heat from the air,  thereby lowering the produce temperature. The incoming air should be less than  65 percent relative humidity for effective evaporative cooling. It will only  reduce temperature, 10-15°F. This method would be suitable for warm-season  crops requiring warmer storage temperatures <br />
(45-55°F), such as tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers or eggplant.</p>
