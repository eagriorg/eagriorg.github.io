				<p align="center"><strong>UNIT LAYOUT-SELECTION OF SITE AND PRECAUTIONS FOR  HYGIENIC CONDITIONS OF THE UNIT</strong><br />
                    <strong>Availability of raw materials</strong><br />
				  <p>Raw material is of  primary importance. It should be of very high quality. The price of the raw  material is one of the main factors which affect the cost of the finished  products. In India, the price of fruits and vegetables is quite high in the  beginning of the season but there is a glut when plenty o0f raw material of  excellent quality can be purchased at low cost.<br />
  <strong>Site and building</strong> <br />
  <strong>            </strong>The site of the plant  dealing with fruits and vegetables should be near the growing area to ensure  the ready availability of freshly picked raw materials and to minimize the time  taken for its transport.<br />
				  The site should have  adequate water supply and enough space should be available so that there is no  congestion and there is scope for further expansion of the plant. Sites having  factories nearby which emits fumes that contaminate the air are not suitable. <br />
				  After selecting the site  the question of the type of building is to be considered. Existing old  buildings are not suitable. The building should be designed for Indian  conditions. Single- storied structures based o0n the requirement of working  space, cost of the land, etc., are preferable as all equipments heavy machinery  can be erected without difficulty and can be shifted easily whenever necessary.  Ventilation and lighting are also better in single –storied buildings.  Generally fruit and vegetable processing units are single-storied. The division  of space should be done according to the steps of the process.<br />
  <strong>Receiving and storage section</strong><strong> </strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The area will depend on the nature of the raw  materials. The receiving area should be as near to rail and road as possible  specially where perishable products are concerned.<br />
  <strong>Preparation section</strong><strong> </strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The preparation section of fruit and vegetable  processing plant requires a greater area. It should be well sanitated so that  the risk of spoilage is reduced. The section should be fitted with water and  steam lines such that the spreading of hoses while washing is avoided. As far  as possible floors should be (a) resistant to chemicals, (b) resistant to wear (c) slip-proof, and d) have proper slope with clean and well-placed  drains. The area can also be subdivided into different compartments for washing,  peeling or shelling, extraction of juice, etc.<br />
				  Filling, exhausting,  sealing and processing section: care should be taken to control the humidity in  this section where process like exhausting and sterilizing operations are  mainly carried out. The floor should be quite sturdy to withstand heavy wear  and tear.<br />
  <strong>Finishing section</strong><strong> </strong><br />
				  This section where  incubation, lacquering, labeling and packing are done should be scrupulously  clean, cool and dry with good ventilation.<br />
  <strong>Laboratory</strong><strong> </strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Although a laboratory is expensive to set-up  it is a very important unit in a fruit and vegetable processing plant. Its  functions are: (a) examination of raw materials (b) control of processes (c)  quality control of finished products (d) introduction of new processes and  better products and (e) development of new techniques.<br />
				  Apart from these  sections, there should be suitable arrangement for storing, keeping machinery  and other equipment and disposal of waste.<br />
  <strong> Water supply</strong><br />
				  Water  plays an important role in the food industry. It is used in substantial  quantities for (a) cleaning of equipment, floors, walls, etc., (b) washing and  preparation of raw materials, (c) preparation of brine, syrups, etc., (d)  blanching, (e) cooling of processed cans, and (f) steam generation, etc.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The water should be free from contamination. If necessary, it should be  chlorinated. <br />
  <strong>Disposal  of waste </strong> <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A large quantity of waste is produced by a cannery, containing a high  percentage of solid matter, such as skins, peels and colloidal starchy  material. Hence the cannery should be situated at such a place where waste  could also be profitably utilized to make by-products. <br />
  <strong>Transport  facilities </strong> <br />
				  It  is essential that the cannery should be situated near a road which connects it  important towns in that area. <br />
  <strong>SANITARY REQUIREMENTS OF A FACTORY OF  FRUIT PRODUCTS</strong> </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>The  Premises - adequately lighted, ventilated &amp; cleaned by white washing/color  washing or oil painting.</li>
				  <li>Windows  &amp; all openings shall be well screened with wire-mesh &amp; the doors fitted  with automatic closing springs, roof shall be permanent, floor cemented.</li>
				  <li>The  equipments and the factory l not be used for manufacture of repugnant products  like fish, meat, eggs etc. </li>
				  <li>The  premises - located in a sanitary place with open surroundings, preferably  in                industrial  area/estates. Communicated not directly with residence.</li>
				  <li>Adequate  arrangements for cleaning equipments, machinery, containers tables and raw  materials shall be provided. Copper, brass  or iron equipments, containers or vessels are not permitted.</li>
				  <li> The water used shall be potable.</li>
				  <li> Adequate drainage system and provisions for  disposal of refuse shall be made.</li>
				  <li> Sufficient number of latrine &amp; urinals  shall be provided for workers.</li>
				  <li> Wherever cooking is done on open fire, proper  outlets for smoke/steam etc. like chimney, exhaust fan etc. shall be provided.</li>
				  <li> The workers engaged in the factory shall be  healthy and shall be medically examined, inoculated and vaccinated whenever  required.</li>
				  <li> The workers shall be provided with aprons,  head-wears gloves etc. and shall be personally neat and tidy. </li>
			    </ol>
				<p>            Satisfactory hygienic  conditions are also maintained during processing, in order to protect the  product from bacterial contamination. For the routine bacteriological control  of the plant or factory, counts on utensils, equipment, working surfaces, walls  and floors are regularly carried out and the results tabulated or recorded on  charts to give an immediate indication of any change. The counts are used as a  check on the sanitary conditions of the plant. If the sanitary conditions of  manufacture are to be passed as being “good”, the general bacterial counts must  be low. In addition, periodic inspection of the plant is made by a trained  inspector to make sure that adequate hygiene standards are maintained.</p>
