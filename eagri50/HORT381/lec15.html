				<p align="center"><strong>PREPARATION  OF JAMS, JELLIES, MARMALADES, CANDIES, CRYSTALLIZED AND GLAZED FRUITS,  PRESERVES, CHUTNEYS, PICKLES, KETCHUP, SAUCE, PUREE, SYRUPS, JUICES, SQUASHES  AND CORDIALS</strong><br />
                    <strong>PREPARATION  OF JAMS</strong><br />
  <p> Jam is a product made by boiling fruit pulp with sufficient quantity of sugar  to a reasonably thick consistency, firm enough to hold the fruit tissues in  position.&nbsp; Apply, sapota, papaya, plums, mango, grapes, jack, pineapple,  banana, guava and pears are used for preparation of jam. It can be prepared from  one kind of fruit or from two or more kinds.In its preparation about 45% of  fruit pulp should be used for every 55% of sugar.The FPO specification of jam  is 68.5% TSS, 45% of fruit pulp and 0.5-0.6% of acid (citric acid) per 100 gm  of the prepared product.<br />
  <strong>a)  Selection and preparation of fruit &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> <br />
				  Select  good quality ripe fruits. Wash the fruits well in cold water.&nbsp; Peel the  fruits and remove the stones and corers present. Cut the peeled fruit into  small pieces with a stainless steel knife. If the fruit is hard, it should be  cut into very small pieces. Pulp the fruits by using pulper.<br />
  <strong>b)  Addition of sugar and acid </strong> <br />
  <strong>c)  Cooking </strong> <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Cook the mixture slowly with occasional stirring.The fruit pulp should be  crushed with a laddle during cooking. Continue cooking till the temperature of  the mass reaches 105.5oC.<br />
  <strong>&nbsp;Sheet  (or) Flake Test </strong> <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A small portion of jam is taken out during boiling in a spoon or wooden laddle  and cooled slightly. It is then allowed to drop. If the product falls off in  the form of a sheet (or) flakes instead of flowing in a continuous stream (or)  syrup, it means that the end point has been reached and the product is ready.  Otherwise boiling is continued till the sheet test is positive.<br />
  <strong>d)  Packaging&nbsp; </strong> <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Fill the hot jam into clean dry sterilized jars. Allow the jam to cool and fix  the sterilized lid to the jar. Store in a cool place.<br />
  <strong>Process </strong> <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ripe firm fruits → Washing → Peeling →Pulping (Remove seed and core) → Addition  of sugar and acid → Boiling (with continuous stirring) → Judging of end point  by further cooking upto 105oC (or) 68% TSS (or) by sheet test →  Filling hot into sterilized bottles → cooling → Sterilized bootles → cooling →  Waxing → Capping → Storage (at ambient temperature).<br />
  <strong>PREPARATION  OF JELLY </strong> <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A jelly is a semi solid product prepared by boiling a clear, strained solution  of pectin containing fruit extract, free from pulp, after the addition of sugar  and acid. A perfect jelly should be transparent, well set but not too stiff,  and should have the original flavour of the fruit. It should be of attractive  colour and keep its shape when removed from the mould. It should be firm enough  to retain a sharp edge but tender enough when it is pressed. It should not be  gummy, sticky or syrupy or have crystallized sugar.The product should be free  from dullness with little (or) no syneresis (weeping) and neither tough nor  rubbery. The FPO specification for jelly is the final product should have 65%  solids, 45% fruit extract and 0.5-0.75% acid.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Guava, sour apple, plum, karonda, wood apple, papaya and jack fruit are rich in  pectin and generally used for preparation of jelly. Pineapple, strawberry  grapes etc. can be used but only after addition of pectin powder, because these  fruits have low pectin content. Preparation of jelly is similar to that of jam.<br />
  <strong>&nbsp;Process </strong> <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Fruit (Firm, not over ripe) → Washing → Cutting into thin slices → Boiling with  water (1 ½ times the weight of fruits for about 20-30 min) → Addition of citric  acid during boiling (2 g per kg of fruit) → Straining of extract → Pectin test  (for addition of sugar) → Addition of sugar → Boiling → Judging of end point  (sheet / drop / temp test)&nbsp; → Removal of scum (or) foam (one teaspoonful  of edible oil added for 45 kg sugar) → Addition of colour and remaining citric  acid → Filling hot into clean sterilized bottles → Waxing (paraffin wax) →  Capping → Storage at ambient temperature. <br />
  <strong>Important  considerations in jelly making</strong> <br />
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Pectin,  acid, sugar (65%) and water are the four essential ingredients. Pectin test and  determination of end point of jelly formation are very important for the  quality of jelly.<br />
  <strong>PREPARATION  OF MARMALADE</strong> <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This is a fruit jelly in which slices of the fruit (or) its peel are suspended.  The term is generally used for products made from citrus fruits like oranges and  lemons in which shredded peel is used as the suspended material. Citrus  marmalades are classified into (1) jelly marmalade (2) jam marmalade. The FPO  specifications for marmalade are TSS- 65% and fruit juice - 45% of the prepared  product.<br />
  <strong>Ingredients </strong> <br />
				  Pectin  extract              -           1  litre<br />
				  Sugar                            -          750 gm<br />
				  Shredded peel          -           62 gm<br />
  <strong>Jelly  marmalade</strong><strong> </strong><br />
				  It  prepared from the clarified pectin extract.<br />
  &nbsp;<strong>Process&nbsp; </strong><br />
				  Ripe  fruits → Washing → Peeling outer yellow portion (Flavedo) thinly → Cutting  yellow portion into fine shreds (1.9 - 2.5 cm long and 0.8 – 0.12 cm thick)   Cutting of 0.3-0.45 cm thick slices of peeled fruit (or) crushing into pulp in  a greater → Boiling (in 2-3 times its weight of H2O for 40-60 min.)  Straining the extract  Testing for pectin content (alcohol test) → Addition of  sugar (as required)  <strong>&nbsp;</strong>Cooking to 103-105oC (Continuous  stirring)  Addition of prepared shreds (shredded peel boiled for 10 to 15 min.  in several changes of water for softening and removing bitterness and added @  about 62 g per kg of extract)  Boiling till jellying point (continuous  stirring)  Testing for end point (sheet / drop / temp. test)  Cooling (to  82-88oC with continuous stirring)  Flavouring (orange oil)   Filling in sterilized bottles → Sealing → Storage at ambient temperature.<br />
  <strong>Jam  Marmalade </strong> <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The method of preparation is practically the same as that for jelly marmalade.  In this case the pectin extract of fruit is not clarified and the whole pulp is  used. Sugar is added according to the weight of fruit, generally in the  proportion of 11. The pulp – sugar mixture is cooked till the TSS content  reaches 65%.<br />
  <strong>PREPARATION  OF CANDIED FRUITS / VEGETABLES</strong> <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A fruit /vegetable impregnated with cane sugar (or) glucose syrup and  subsequently drained free of syrup and dried is known as candied fruit /  vegetable. The most suitable fruits for candying are amla, kranda, pineapple,  cherry, papaya, apple, peels of orange, lemon, grape fruit and ginger etc. The  FPO specifications for candied fruits are TSS -75%, total sugar-70% and  reducing sugar-25%.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The process for making candied fruit is practically similar to that for  preserves.The only difference is that the fruit impregnated with syrup having a  higher percentage of sugar – 75obx.The syrup left over from the candying  process can be used for candying another batch of the same kind of fruit after  suitable dilution, for sweetening chutneys, sauces and pickles and vinegar  making.<br />
  <strong>PREPARATION  OF CRYSTALLIZED FRUITS /VEGETABLES</strong> <br />
				  Candied  fruits /vegetables coated with crystals of sugar, either by rolling in finely  powdered sugar or by allowing sugar crystals from dense syrup to deposit on  them are called crystallized fruit / vegetable.</p>
				The candied fruits are placed on a wire mesh tray  which is placed in a deep vessel. Cooled syrup (70% TSS) is gently poured over  the fruit so as to cover it entirely. The whole
<p>mass  is left undisturbed for 12-18 hrs during which a thin coating of crystallized  sugar is formed. The tray is then taken out carefully from the vessel and the  surplus syrup dried off. The fruits are then placed in a single layer on wire  mesh trays and drained at room temperature or at about 49oC in  driers.<br />
  <strong>PREPARATION  OF GLAZED FRUITS /VEGETABLES</strong> <br />
Covering  of candied fruits / vegetables with a thin transparent coating of sugar, which  imparts them a glossy appearance is known as glazing.<br />
Cane  sugar and water (21 by weight) are boiled in a steam pan at 113-114oC  and the scum is removed as it comes up. Thereafter the syrup is cooled to 93oC  and rubbed with a wooden laddle on the side of the pan when granulated sugar is  obtained. Dried candied fruits are passed through this granulated portion of  the sugar solution, one by one, by means of fork and then placed on trays in a  warm dry room. They may also be dried in a drier at 49oC fir 2-3 hrs  when they become crisp, they are packed in airtight containers for storage.<br />
<strong>Preparation  of Preserves</strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A mature fruit / vegetable (or) its pieces impregnated with heavy sugar syrup  till it becomes tender and transparent is known as preserve. Aonla, apple,  pear, mango, cherry, karonda, strawberry, pineapple, papaya, carrot etc. can be  used for making preserves. FPO specifications for preserve is TSS 68obx  and fruit pulp - 55%.<br />
<strong>General  considerations </strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Cooking of fruit directly in syrup causes shrinking of fruit and reduces  absorption of sugar. Therefore, the fruit should be blanched first to make it  soft enough to absorb water, before steeping in syrup. However, highly juicy  fruits may be cooked directly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Fruits may be cooked in syrup by three processes as given below <br />
<strong>i.  Rapid process</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>Fruits are cooked in low sugar syrup. Boiling is  continued with gentle heating until the syrup becomes sufficiently thick. Soft  fruits such as strawberries, grapes which require very little boiling for  softening.&nbsp; Unlike hard fruits like apples, pears and peaches, which  require prolonged heating. Rapid boiling should, however be avoided as it makes  the fruit tough, especially when heating is done in a large shallow pan with only  a small quantity of syrup. The final concentration of sugar should not be less  than 68% which corresponds to a boiling point of 106oC. This is a  simple and cheap process but the flavour and colour of the product are lost  considerably during boiling.<br />
<strong>ii.  Slow process </strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The fruit is blanched until it becomes soft. Sugar, equal to the weight of  fruit, is then added to the fruit in alternate layers and the mixture allowed  to stand for 24 hrs. During this period, the fruit gives out water and the sugar  goes into solution, resulting in a syrup containing 37-38% TSS. Next day, the  syrup is boiled after removal of fruits to raise its strength to about 60% TSS.  A small quantity of citric acid (1 to 1.5 g/kg&nbsp; sugar) is also added to  invert a portion of the cane sugar and thus prevent crystallization. The whole  mass is then boiled for 4-5 min. and kept for 24 hrs. On the third day, the  strength of syrup is raised to about 65% TSS by boiling. The fruit is then left  in the syrup for a day. Finally, the strength of the syrup is raised to 70% TSS  and the fruits are left in it for a week. The preserve is now ready and is  packed in containers. This method is usually practiced.<br />
<strong>3.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Vacuum process</strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The fruit is first softened by boiling and then placed in the syrup which  should have 30-35% TSS. The fruit-syrup blend is then transferred to a vacuum  pan and concentrate under reduced pressure to 70% TSS. Preserves made by this  process retain the flavour and colour of the fruit better than by the other two  methods.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In all these processes, the fruit is kept covered with syrup during cooking as  well as afterwards otherwise it will dry up and the quality of the product  would be affected.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The product should be cooled quickly after the final boiling to prevent  discolouration during storage.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The fruits are drained free of syrup and filled in dry containers or glass  jars. Freshly prepared boiling syrup containing 68% TSS is then poured into the  jars / containers which are then sealed airtight. In the commercial scale  production, however, it is better to strerilize the cans to eliminate any  possibility of spoilage of product during storage.<br />
<strong>Process </strong><br />
            Mature fruits → Washing →  Preparation of fruit for sugar treatment → Keeping fruit and sugar in alternate  layers (1.0 kg Fruit: 1 kg Sugar) (or) steeping fruit in syrup of 40% TSS for a  day → Removal of fruit →&nbsp; Increasing consistency of syrup to 60% TSS by  boiling  Steeping of fruit for a day <strong>→</strong>Repeating the process and raising  strength of syrup by 5% TSS to 70% on alternate days – Steeping in 70% TSS for  a week <strong>→ </strong>Preserve – Draining – Filling in jar (or) container → Covering  fruit with freshly prepared sugar syrup of 68% TSS &nbsp; Sealing (airtight) –  Storage.<br />
<strong>PREPARATION  OF CHUTNEYS</strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; A good quality chutney should be palatable and appetizing. Mango chutney  is an important food product exported from India to many countries. Apple and  apricot chutneys are also very popular in the country.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The method of preparation of chutney is similar to that for jam except that  spices, vinegar and salt are added. The fruits / vegetables are peeled, sliced  or grated or cut into small pieces and cooked in water until they become  sufficiently soft. The quality of chutney depends to a large extent on its  cooking which should be done for a long time at a temperature below the boiling  point. To ensure proper thickening, cooking is done without a lid even though  this results in some loss of volatile oils from the spices. Chopped onion and  garlic are added at the start to mellow their strong flavours. Spices are  coarsely powdered before adding. Vinegar extract of spices may be used instead  of whole spices. Spices and vinegar are added just before the final stage of  cooking, because prolonged boiling causes loss of some of the essential oils of  spices and of vinegar by volatilization. In mango and apricot sweet chutneys,  where vinegar is used in large quantity, the amount of sugar added may be  reduced, because vinegar itself acts as a preservative. These chutneys are  cooked to the consistency of jam to avoid fermentation.<br />
<strong>Sweet  mango chutney</strong> <br />
<strong>Recipe</strong><strong> </strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>Mango  slices (or) shreds – 1.0 kg, sugar (or) gur – 1.0 kg, salt – 45 g, onions  (chopped) – 50 g, garlic (chopped)-15 g , ginger (chopped) – 15 g, red chilli  powder – 10 g, black pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, cumin – 10 g each, cloves – 5  nos. and vinegar – 170 ml.<br />
<strong>Process </strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Mature mangoes → washing → Peeling →Grating (or) slicing → cooking with a  little water to make highly soft → Mixing with sugar and salt and leaving for  an hour → Keeping all ingredients (except vinegar) in cloth bag, tied loosely,  putting in mixture and cooking on low flame →During cooking, spice bag pressed  occasionally&nbsp;  Cooking to consistency of jam (upto 105oC) with  stirring occasionally → Removal of spice bag after squeezing → Addition of  vinegar → Cooking for 2-5 min. → Filling hot into bottles → Sealing (airtight)  → Storage at ambient temperature.<strong> </strong></p>
				<p><strong>PREPARATION  OF PICKLES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The preservation of food in common salt (or) in vinegar is known as pickling.  It is one of the most ancient methods of preserving fruits and vegetables.  Pickles are good appetizers and add to the palatability of a meal. They  stimulate the flow of gastric juice and thus helps in digestion.<br />
  <strong>Preservation  by salt&nbsp; (NaCl2)</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Sodium chloride is an  indispensable component of food. At lower concentrations it contributes  significantly to the flavour.&nbsp; At higher concentrations it exhibits an  important bacteriostatic action. Salt is easily available and not expensive.<br />
  <strong>Pickling  process</strong> <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pickling is done in two stages (1) By curing (or) fermentation with dry salting  (or) fermentation in brine (or) salting without fermentation (2) By finishing  and packing.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pickling is the result of fermentation by lactic acid forming bacterial which  are generally present in large numbers on the surface of fresh vegetables and  fruits. Theses bacteria can grow in acid medium and in the presence of 8-10%  salt solution whereas the growth of a majority of undesirable organisms is  inhibited. Lactic acid bacteria are most active at 30oC, so this  temperature must be maintained as far as possible in the early stage of pickle  making. When vegetables are placed in brine, it penetrates into the tissues of  the farmers and soluble material present in them diffuses into the brine by  osmosis. The soluble material includes fermentable sugars and minerals. The  sugars serve as food for lactic acid bacteria which convert them into lactic  acid and other acids. The acid brine thus formed acts upon vegetables tissues  to produce the characteristics taste and aroma of pickle. There are two methods  for pickling <br />
  <strong>1.  Dry salting method</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Alternate layers of  vegetables and salt (20-30 gm of dry salt/kg vegetables) are kept in a vessel  which is covered with a cloth and a wooden board and allowed to stand for about  24 hrs. During this period, due to osmosis, sufficient juice comes out from the  vegetables to form brine.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The amount of brine required is usually equal to half the volume of vegetables.  Brining is the most important step in pickling. The growth of a majority of  spoilage organisms is inhibited by brine containing 15% salt. Lactic acid  bacteria, which are salt tolerant can thrive in brine of 8-10% strength though  fermentation takes place fairly well even in 5% brine. In a brine containing  10% salt, fermentation proceeds somewhat slowly. Fermentation takes place to  some extent upto 15% but stops at 20% strength. It is therefore, advisable to  place the vegetables in 10% salt solution for vigorous lactic acid  fermentation.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As soon as the brine is formed, the fermentation process starts and Co2  begins to evolve. The salt content is now increased gradually, so that by the  time the pickle is ready, salt concentration reaches 15%. When fermentation is  over, gas formation ceases.</p>
				             
				<p>Under favourable conditions fermentation is completed in7-10 days. When  sufficient lactic acid has been formed, lactic acid bacteria cease to grow and  no further change takes</p>
				<p>place  in the vegetables. However, precautions should be taken against spoilage by  aerobic microorganisms, because in the presence of air, pickle sum is formed  which brings about putrefaction and destroys the lactic acid. Properly brined  vegetables keep well in vinegar for a long time.<br />
                  <strong>II.&nbsp;Fermentation  in brine</strong> <br />
Steeping  of the vegetable in a salt solution of pre-determined concentration for a  certain length of time is called brining. This type of treatment is adopted in  the case of cucumbers and similar vegetables which do not contain sufficient  juice to form brine with dry salt. Brine can be prepared by dissolving in common  salt in water and filtering it through the cloth to remove insoluble  impurities. The remaining process is similar to that of dry salting method.<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Raw  materials used in pickling</strong><br />
<strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Salt:</strong>&nbsp;  Free from impurities, and salts such as lime (CaO), iron (blackening),  magnesium (results bitter taste) and carbonates (makes the pickle soft in  texture).<br />
<strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Vinegar:</strong>&nbsp;  Vinegar of good quality should contain atleast 4% acetic acid. Synthetic  vinegar (or) low quality vinegar are not suitable for pickle preparations. Usually  malt (or) cider vinegar is used. In order to ensure good keeping quality  pickle, the final concentration of acetic acid in the pickle should not be less  than 2%. Acetic acid (commercial) is also used because it is highly  concentrated.<br />
<strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Sugar:</strong>&nbsp;  Used in the preparation of sweet pickles should be of high quality.<br />
<strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Spices: </strong>Spices  are added practically to all pickles, the quantity added depending upon the  kind of fruit (or) vegetable taken and the kind of flavour desired. The spices  generally used are bay leaves, cardamom, chillies, cinnamon, clove, coriander,  dill herb, ginger, mace, mustard,black pepper, cumin, turmeric, garlic, mint,  fenugreek, asafoetida etc.<br />
<strong>5. Water: </strong>Only potable water should be used for the  preparation of brine. Hard water contains salts of Ca, Na, Mg etc., which  interfere with the normal salt curing of the vegetable. If hard water is to be  used, a small quantity of vinegar should also be added to the brine the  neutralize its alkalinity. Iron should not be present in the water in any  appreciable quantity as it causes the blackening of the pickle. <br />
<strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Cooking  utensils:</strong>&nbsp; Metallic vessels should be non-corrodiable. Vessels made of  iron (or) copper are not suitable. Glass -lined vessels, and stainless steel  vessels are preferred. The laddles, spoons and measuring vessels should also be  masde on non-corrodible materials. At present, pickles are prepared with salt,  vinegar, oil (or) with a mixture of salt, oil, spices and vinegar. These  methods are discussed below <br />
<strong>I. Preservation with salt</strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Salt improves the taste and flavour and hardens the tissues of vegetables and  controls fermentation. Vegetables do not ferment when they are packed with a  large quantity of salt. Spoilage is prevented by adding sufficient common salt,  bringing its final concentration in the material from 15-20%. At this high salt  concentration, mould and even lactic acid forming bacteria do not grow. This  method of preservation is applicable only to vegetables which contain very  little sugar because sufficient lactic acid cannot be formed by fermentation to  act as preservative. Some fruits like lime, mango, etc. are also preserved with  salt.<br />
<strong>Example </strong> <br />
<strong>1.&nbsp;Lime pickle:</strong>&nbsp; Lime – 1 kg,  salt – 200 g red chilli powder –15 g, cinnamon, cumin, cardamom and black  pepper (powdered) each –10 g cloves – 5 Nos.<br />
<strong>Process </strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Limes → Washing&nbsp; →Cutting into 4 pieces → Squeezing out juice from ¼  amount of fruit → Mixing spices and salt with juice → Mixing with lime pieces →  Filling in jars → Covering with lid → Keeping in sun for 4-6 days (shaking jar  atleast twice a day) → Storage at ambient temperature.<br />
<strong>II.  Preservation with vinegar</strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In vinegar pickles, vinegar acts as a preservation. The final concentration of  acid as acetic acid in the finished pickle should not be less than 2%. To avoid  dilution of vinegar below this strength by the H2O liberated from  the tissues, the vegetables (or) fruits are generally placed in strong vinegar  of about 10% acidity for several days before final packing. This treatment  helps to expel the gases present in the intercellular spaces of vegetable  tissues. Papaya, pears, onion, garlic, chillies, mango and cucumber pickles are  prepared in this method.<br />
<strong>Example </strong> <br />
<strong>Cucumber  pickle&nbsp; </strong><br />
            Cucumber – 1.0 kg, salt – 200 g red  chilli powder – 15 g, cardamom (large), cumin, black pepper (powdered) each –  10 g, cloves –&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 Nos., vinegar – 750 ml.<br />
<strong>Process&nbsp; </strong><br />
Cucumbers  → Washing → Peeling → Cutting into 5 cm round pieces → Mixing with salt → Filling  in jar → Standing for 6-8 hrs → Draining off H2O → Adding spices and  vinegar → Keeping in sun for a week → Storage.<br />
<strong>III.  Preservation with oil</strong> <br />
The  fruit (or) vegetable should be completely immersed in the edible oil.  Cauliflower, lime, mango, amla, karonda, bittergourd, brinjal, turnip pickles  are prepared from this method.<br />
<strong>Example&nbsp; </strong> <br />
<strong>Green  chilli pickle: </strong>Green chillies – 1 kg, salt – 150 gm, mustard  (ground) – 100 gm lime juice – 200 ml (or) amchur – 200 gm, fenugreek cardamom  (large), turmeric, cumin (powdered) each – 15 gm, mustard oil – 400 ml.<br />
<strong>Process </strong><br />
Green  chillies → Washing →Drying → Making incision → Mixing all spices in a little  lime juice → Mixing with chillies → Filling into jar → Adding lime juice and  oil → Keeping in sun for a week – Storage.<br />
<strong>IV.  Preparation with mixture of salt, oil, spices and vinegar</strong> <br />
<strong>Example</strong> <br />
<strong>Tomato  pickle: </strong>Tomatoes – 1 kg, salt 75 g, garlic (chopped) – 10 g,  ginger (chopped)- 50 g, red chilli powder, cumin, cardamom (large), cinnamom,  turmeric, fenugreek – each – 10 g, cloves – 50 nos, asafoetida (powdered) – 2g,  vinegar – 250 ml, oil – 300 ml.<br />
<strong>Process </strong><br />
Tomatoes  (ripe, firm and pulpy) → Washing → Blanching for 5 min → Cooling immediately in  water → Peeling → Cutting into 4-6 pieces (or) mashing → Frying all ingredients  in a little oil except vinegar → Mixing with pieces → Heating for 2 min →  Cooling → Addition of vinegar and remaining oil → Filling in jar → Storage.<br />
<strong>PREPARATION  OF SAUCES / KETCHUPS</strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  There is no essential difference between sauce and ketchup. However, sauces are  generally thinner and contain more total solids than ketchups. Tomato, apple,  papaya, walnut, soybean etc. are used for making sauces. The FPO specifications  of sauces are TSS – 25% and acidity – 1%.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sauces are of two kinds (i) thin sauces of low viscosity consistency mainly of  vinegar extract of flavouring materials like herbs and spices and (ii) thick  sauces that are highly viscous.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sauces / ketchups are prepared from more or less the same ingredients and in  the same manner as chutney, except that the fruit or vegetable pulp or juice  used in sieved after cooking to remove the skin, seeds and stalks of fruits.  Vegetables and spices and to give a smooth consistency to the final product.  However, cooking takes longer because fine pulp (or) juice is used.</p>
				             <p>Some sauces develop a characteristic flavour and aroma on storing in wooden  barrels. Freshly prepared products often have a raw and harsh taste and have,  therefore, to be matured by storage. High quality sauces, are prepared by  maceration of spices herbs, fruits and vegetables in cold vinegar or by boiling  them in vinegar. Thickening agents are also added to			</p>
				             <p>the  sauce to prevent sedimentation of solid particles. Apple pulp is commonly used  for this purpose in India but starch from potato, maize, arrow root (cassava)  and sago are also used.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A fruit sauce should be cooked to such a consistency that it can be freely  poured without the fruit tissues separating out in the bottle. The colour of  the sauce should be bright. Sauces usually thicken slightly on cooling. By  using a funnel hot ketchup is filled in bottles leaving a 2 cm head space at  the top and the bottles are sealed or corked at once. The necks of the bottles  when cold, are dipped in paraffin wax for airtight sealing.</p>

                  <strong>Apple  sauce </strong> <br />
                  <strong>Recipe  : </strong>Apple  – 1.0 kg, sugar – 250&nbsp; g, salt – 10 g, onion (chopped) – 200 g, ginger  (chopped) – 100 g, garlic (chopped) - 50 g, red chillipowder – 10 g, cloves – 5  Nos. cinnamon, cardamom – 15 g (each), vinegar – 50 ml, sodium benzoate – 0.7  g/kg of finished product.<br />
                  <strong>Process</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Apples<strong> </strong>→  Washing → Peeling → Removal of core and seeds → Making into fine pulp →  Straining of pulp → Cooking pulp with one third quantity of sugar → Putting  spice bag in pulp and processing occasionally → Cooking to one - third of  original volume of pulp → Removal of spice bag (after squeezing in pulp)  →Adding remaining sugar and salt → Cooking to one – third its original volume →  Addition of vinegar and preservative → Filling hot into bottles → Crown corking  → Pasteurization at 85-90oC  for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30 min. → Cooling  → Storage at ambient temperature.<strong></strong><br />
                  <strong>PREPARATION  OF PUREE AND PASTE </strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Tomato pulp without skin or seeds, with or without added salt, and containing  not less than 9.0% of salt free tomato solids, is known as medium tomato  puree’. It can be concentrated further to heavy tomato puree which contains not  less than 12.0% solids. If this is further concentrated so that it contains not  less than 25% tomato solids, it is known as tomato paste, on further  concentration to 33% or more of solids it is called concentrated tomato paste.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Tomato pulp is prepared from ripe tomatoes in the same manner as tomato juice.  Cooking for concentration of the pulp can be done either in an open cooker or a  vacuum pan. In the former most of the vitamins are destroyed and the product  become brown. On the other hand, use of vacuum pans, which are extensive, help  to preserve the nutrients, and also reduce the browning to a great extent. In  vacuum pans the juice is boiled at about 71oC only. While  cooking in an open cooker, a little butter or edible oil is added to prevent  foaming, burning and sticking.<br />
After&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  cooking, the total solids content of the juice is higher than required, more  juice is added to lower it, if it is lower, cooking is continued till the  desired concentration is reached. The endpoint of cooking puree and paste can  be determined either with a hand refractometer or by measuring the volume.<br />
<strong>Process </strong><br />
            Tomato juice (strained) → Cooking to  desired consistency (open cooker / vacuum pan) → Judging of endpoint for puree  (or) paste → Filling hot into bottles or cans (82-88oC) →  Sterilization in boiling water for 20 min. →Cooling → Storage at ambient  temperature.<br />
<strong>PREPARATION  OF SYRUP</strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This type of fruit beverage contains 25% fruit juice (or) pulp, 65% TSS, 1.3 to  1.5% acidity and 350 ppm of So2 or 600 ppm of KMS. It is diluted  before serving, Fruits like aonla, jamun, pomegrante, grape, lemon, orange and  sometimes ginger can be used for the preparation of syrup. It is also prepared  from extracts of rose, sandal almond etc.<br />
<strong>Synthetic  syrups</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Heavy sugar syrup of 70-75 per cent strength is used as the base of all  synthetic syrups and they are flavoured and coloured with artificial  essence/flavours and colours. They never contain fruit pulp/juice. A large  proportion of these syrups can, however, be replaced by real fruit juices,  squashes and syrups which are more nutritious.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Large quantities of synthetic syrups (orange, lemon, pineapple, strawberry) are  manufactured and sold in varius countries. These can be prepared by using 1.5  kg of sugar, 500 ml of H2O and 15 g of citric acid.&nbsp; Different  colours and flavours are added as required. Among colours, orange red, lemon  yellow, green, raspberry red etc. are mostly used, while artificial  essence/flavours of rose, orange, pineapple, strawberry, lemon etc. are added  as flavouring substances.<br />
<strong>PREPARATION  OF FRUIT JUICES</strong> <br />
<strong>i.  Selection of fruit</strong>:<br />
&nbsp;  All fruits are not suitable because of difficulties in extracting the juice or  because the juice is of poor quality. The variety and maturity of the fruit and  locality of cultivation influence the flavour and keeping quality of its juice.  Only fully ripe fruits are selected. Over ripe and green fruits, if used,  adversely affect the quality of the juice.<br />
<strong>ii.  Sorting and washing </strong> <br />
Diseased,  damaged (or) decayed fruits are rejected or trimmed. Dirt and spray residues of  arsenic, lead etc., are removed by washing with water or dilute hydrochloric  acid (1 part acid 20 parts water).<br />
<strong>iii.  Juice extraction&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> <br />
Generally  juice is extracted from fresh fruit by crushing and pressing them. Screw type  juice extractors, basket presses or fruit pulpers are mostly used.<br />
The  method of extraction differs from fruit to fruit because of differences in  their structure and composition. Before pressing, most fruits are crushed to  facilitate the extraction. Some require heat processing for breaking up the  juice – containing tissues. In case of citrus fruits, the fruit is cut into  halves, and the juice extracted by light pressure in a juice extractor or by  pressing the halves in a small wooden juice extraction.&nbsp; Care should be  taken to remove the rind of citrus fruits completely otherwise it makes the  juice bitter. Finally, the juice is strained through a thick cloth or a sieve  to remove seeds. All equipments used in the preparation of fruit juices and  squashes should be rust and acid proof. Copper and iron vessels should be  strictly avoided as these metals react with fruit acids and cause blackening of  the product. Machines and equipments made of aluminium, stainless steel etc.  can be used.&nbsp; Extracted juices should not be unnecessarily exposed to air  as it will spoil the colour, taste and aroma and also reduce the vitamin  content.<br />
<strong>IV.  Deaeration</strong> <br />
Fruit  juices contain some air, most of which is present on the surface of the juice  and some is dissolved in it. Most of the air as well as other gases are removed  by subjecting the fresh juice to a high vacuum. This process is called  deaeration and the equipment used for the purpose is called a deaerator. Being  a very expensive method, it is not used in India at present.<br />
<strong>V.  Straining (or) Filtration&nbsp; </strong> <br />
            Fruit juices always contain varying  amounts of suspended matter consisting of broken fruit tissue, seed, skin,  gums, pectic substances and protein in colloidal suspension. Seeds and pieces  of pulp and skin which adversely affect the quality of juice, are removed by  straining through a thick cloth or sieve. Removal of all suspended matter  improves the appearance but often results in disappearance of fruity character  and flavour. The present practice is to let fruit juices and beverages retain a  cloudy or pulpy appearance to some extent. In case of grape juice, apple juice  and lime juice cordial however, a brilliantly clear appearance is preferred.<br />
<strong>VI.  Clarification</strong> <br />
            Complete removal of all suspended  material from juice, as inlime juice cordial, is known as clarification which  is closely related to the quality, appearance and flavour of the juice. The  following methods of clarification are used (a) Settling (b) filtration (c)  freezing (D) cold&nbsp; storage (e) high temperature (f) chemicals such as  gelatin, albumen, casein, mixture of tannin and gelatin (g) enzymes such as  pectinol and filtragol.<br />
<strong>VII</strong>.&nbsp; <strong>Addition of sugar</strong><br />
All  juices are sweetened by adding sugar, except those of grape and apple. Sugar  also acts as preservative for the flavour and colour and prolongs the keeping  quality. Sugar based products can be divided into 3 groups on the basis of  sugar content.<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Low sugar –  30 per cent sugar or below<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medium sugar  – sugar above 30 and below 50%<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High sugar –  50% sugar and above<br />
Sugar  can be added directly to the juice or as a syrup made by dissolving it in hot  water, clarifying by addition of a small quantity of citric acid or a few drops  of lime juice and filtering.<br />
<strong>VIII.&nbsp;  Fortification</strong> <br />
Juices,  squashes, syrups etc. are sometimes fortified with vitamins to enhance their  nutritive value, to improve taste, texture or colour and to replace nutrients  lost in processing. Usually ascorbic acid and Beta-carotene (water – soluble  form) are added at the rate of 250-500 mg and 7-10 mg per litre, respectively.  Ascorbic acid acts as an antioxidant and beta-carotene imparts an attractive  orange colour. For a balanced taste some acids are added. Citric acid is often  used for all types of beverages and phosphoric acid for cola type of drinks.<br />
<strong>IX.&nbsp;Preservation</strong> <br />
Fruit  juices, RTS and nectars are preserved by pasteurization but sometimes chemical  preservatives are used. Squashes, crushes and cordials are preserved only by  adding chemicals. In the case of syrup, the sugar concentration is sufficient  to prevent spoilage. Fruit juice concentrates are preserved by heating,  freezing or adding chemicals.<br />
<strong>X.&nbsp;Preservation  by Bottling</strong> <br />
Bottles  are thoroughly washed with hot water and filled leaving 1.5-2.5 cm headspace.  They are then sealed either with crown corks (by crown corking machine) or with  caps (by capping machine).<strong>  </strong><br />
<strong>Individual  Beverages </strong> <br />
<strong>1. Juices</strong> <br />
Juices  are of two types<br />
<strong>a.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Natural juice (pure juice):</strong>It is the  juice, as extracted from ripe fruits, and contains only natural sugars.<br />
<strong>b.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Sweetened juice:</strong> It is a liquid product  which contains at least 85% juice and 10% TSS.<br />
Pure  fruit juices such as apple juice and orange juice are commercially manufactured.  Apple juice is generally bottled while other juices are canned.<br />
<strong>Example  Apple juice</strong> <br />
            Apples → Washing with 1.5% Hcl –  Grating (apple grater)→ Crushing for juice extraction → Straining →  Clarification (By enzyme (or) gelatin) → Filtration→ Heating at 82-85oC  → Filling hot into cans →Sealing&nbsp; → Processing at 100oC for 15  min. → Cooling → Storage.<br />
<strong>Citrus  juice</strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;              Mandarin and sweet oranges →  Washing → Peeling (By hand) →&nbsp; Separation and cleaning of segments → Juice  extraction (Screw type extractor) → Straining → Heating at 80oC –  Bottling (or) canning (Baby food cans) → Crown corking (or) can sealing  →Pasteurization → Cooling → Storage.<br />
<strong>Example  for sweetened juice </strong> <br />
<strong>Mango  juice</strong> <br />
            Mangoes (ripe) →&nbsp; washing →  peeling&nbsp;  stone removal →straining of pulp – addition of water (1 lit  pulp&nbsp; 0.5 lit H2O) → mixing with syrup → Homogenization →  Heating at 85oC → Filling hot into cans → sealing → Processing at  100oC for 20 min → cooling → storage. <br />
<strong>2.  Ready-to-serve (RTS)</strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This is a type of fruit beverage which contains atleast 10% fruit juice and 10%  total soluble solids besides about 0.3 per cent acid. It is not diluted before  serving hence it is known as ready to serve.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Commercially RTS beverages (with 13% TSS and 0.3 % acid) can be prepared by  using SO2 -70 ppm or benzoic acid 120 ppm.<br />
<strong>For  example:&nbsp; Papaya RTS</strong> <br />
            Ripe fruits → Washing → Peeling →  Cutting into halves → Seed removal → Passing through pulper → Pulp → Mixing  with strained syrup solution (Sugar + Water acid, heated just to dissolve)  Homogenisation → Bottling → crown corking → Crown corking → Pasteurization  (about 90oC for 25 min) – Cooling →&nbsp; Storage. <br />
<strong>PREPARATION  OF SQUASH </strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This is a type of fruit beverage containing atleast 25 per cent fruit juice  (or) pulp, 45% TSS, 1.0% acidity and 350 ppm of So2 (or) 600 ppm of  sodium benzoate. It is diluted before serving (13). Lime, mango, orange  and&nbsp;pineapple are used for making squash commercially using KMS as  preservative or fruits viz. jamun, passion fruit, raspberry, strawberry, grape  fruit etc. with sodium benzoate as preservative. <br />
<strong>PREPARATION  OF CORDIAL</strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  It is a sparkling, clear, sweetened fruit juice from which pulp and other  insoluble substances have been completely removed. It contains atleast 25%  juice, 30% TSS, 1.5% acid and 350 ppm of So2.This is very suitable for blending  with wines. Lime and lemon are suitable for making cordial.<br />
<strong>Process&nbsp; </strong> <br />
            Fruits → Washing → Cutting into  halves →Juice extraction → Straining →Addition of preservative (kms/gm/litre  juice) → Storing in glass container for 10-15 days for clarification (suspended  material settles down)&nbsp; → Syphoning off the suspernatant clear juice →  Straining and measuring → Preparation of Syrup → Straining → Mixing of juice  with syrup → Addition of preservative → (KMS 0.6 g / lit product) → Bottling →  Capping → Storing in cool and dry place.             </p>
