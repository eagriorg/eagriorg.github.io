				<p align="center"><strong>MATURITY AND RIPENING PROCESS</strong> - <strong>MATURITY</strong><br />
			    <p>It is the stage of fully development  of tissue of fruit and vegetables only after which it will ripen normally.  During the process of maturation the fruit receives a regular supply of food  material from the plant. When mature, the abscission or corky layer which forms  at the stern end stops this inflow. Afterwards, the fruit depend on its own  reserves, carbohydrates are dehydrated and sugars accumulate until the sugar  acid ratio form. In addition to this, typical flavour and characteristic colour  also develop. it has been determined that the stage of maturity at the time of  picking influence the storage life and quality of fruit, when picked immature  like mango develop white patches or air pockets during ripening and lacking in  normal brix acid ratio or sugar acid ratio, taste and flavour on the other hand  if the fruits are harvested over mature or full ripe they are easy susceptible  to microbial and physiological spoilage and their storage life is considerably  reduce. Such fruits persist numerous problems during handling, storage and  transportation. Therefore, it is necessary or essential to pick up the fruits  or vegetables at correct stage of maturity to facilitate proper ripening,  distant transportation and maximum storage life.<br />
  <strong>FRUIT RIPENING</strong><br />
				  Fruit ripening is  a genetically programmed stage of development overlapping with senescence. The  fruit is said to be ripe when it attains its full flavour and aroma and other  characteristics of the best fruit of that particular cultivar. The words  “mature “and “ripe” are essentially synonymous when used to describe these  fruits that ripe on the plants known as non-climacteric. However, in case of  climacteric fruits a mature fruit require period before attaining a desirable  stage of edibility. <br />

				<p><strong>Changes during Fruit Ripening</strong><br />
                    <strong>1. Cell Wall Changes</strong><br />
				  Cell wall consists of pectic  substances and cellulose as the main components alongwith sma1amounts of  hemicellulose and non-cellulosic polysaccharides. In cell wall, the changes  particularly in the middle lamella which is rich in pectic polysaccharides are  degraded and solubilised during ripening. During this softening, there is a  loss of neutral sugars (galactose and arabinose-major components of neutral  protein) and acidic pectin (rhamnogalacturonan) of all cell wall. The major  enzymes implicated in the softening of fruits are pectine1asterase,  polygalacturonase cellulase and b-  galactosidase.<br />
				  <strong>2. Starch</strong><br />
				  During fruit ripening sugar levels  within fruit tend to increase due to either increased sugar importation from  the plant or to the mobilization of starch reserves within the fruit, depending  on the fruit type and whether it is ripened on or off the plant. With the  advancement of maturity, the accumulated starch is hydrolysed into sugars  (glucose, fructose or sugars) which are known as a characteristic event for  fruit ripening. Further breakdown of sucrose into glucose and fructose is  probably mediated by the action of invertase. In vegetables like potato and  peas on the other hand, the higher sucrose content which remains high at fresh  immature stage, converts into starch with the approach of maturity.<br />
  <strong>3.  Organic Acids</strong><br />
				  With the onset of fruit ripening  there is downward trend in the levels of organic acids.  The decline in the content of organic acids  during fruit ripening might be the result of an increase in membrane  permeability which allows acids to be stored in the respiring cells, formation  of salts of malic acid, reduction in the amounts of acid translocated from the  leaves, reduced ability of fruits to synthesize organic acids with fruit  maturity, translocation into sugars and dilution effect due to the increase in  the volume of fruit.<br />
  <strong>4.  Colour</strong><br />
				  With the approach of maturation, the  most obvious change which take place is the degradation of chlorophyll and is  accompanied by the synthesis of other pigments usually either anthocyanins or  carotenoids. They can give rise to a wide range of colours (from red to blue).  The chloroplasts in green immature fruit generally lose chlorophyll on ripening  and change into chromoplasts which contain carotenoid pigments. Carotenoids are  normally synthesized in green plant tissue a major product being 3-carotene.  However, in many fruits additional - carotene and lycopene is synthesized  during ripening.<br />
  <strong>5.  Flavouring Compounds</strong><br />
				  Although fruit flavour depends on  the complex interaction of sugars, organic acids, phenolics and volatile  compounds but the characteristic flavour of an individual fruit or vegetable is  derived from the production of specific flavouring volatile. These compounds  are mainly esters, alcohols, aldehydes, acids and ketones. At least 230 and 330  different compounds in apple and orange fruits have been indicated  respectively.<br />
  <strong>6.  Ascorbic Acid</strong><br />
				  L-ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) is the  naturally occurring ascorbic acid in fruits. A reduced amount of ascorbic acid  is noticed in pome, stone and berry fruits at the time of harvest. An increase  in ascorbic acid content with the increase in fruit growth has been and the  levels declined with the advancement of maturity and onset of fruit ripening in  pear, sweet potatoes, potato, asparagus and okra during the course of post  harvest handling.<br />
  <strong>7.  Phenolics</strong> <br />
				  The phenolic content of most fruits  declines from high levels during early growth to low levels when the fruit is  considered to be physiologically mature and thereafter susceptible to the  induction of ripening.<br />
  <strong>8.  Amino Acids and Proteins</strong><br />
				  Decrease in free amino acid which  often reflects an increase in protein synthesis. During senescence the level of  free amino acids increases reflecting a breakdown enzymes and decreased  metabolic activity. <br />
  <strong>9.  Ethylene Production and Respiration</strong><br />
				  Physiological events responsible to  ripening process are as follows<br />
				  (1) Ethylene production<br />
				  (2) Rise in respiration<br />
  <strong>Ethylene  production</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>In climacteric fruits  such as mango, banana, ethylene production increase and causes:<br />
				  •  Rise in respiration<br />
				  •  Rise in temperature<br />
				  •  Rise in activity of hydrolytic enzymes.<br />
				  Ethylene is produced from an  essential amino acid — methionine. Following the steps as below:</p>
				<p>                                 <img src="lec03" /><br />
                  <strong>Rise  in respiration</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Respiration is  required for releasing energy and the substrate for synthesis of several  organic compounds required in the ripening process. During ripening in  climacteric fruits, there is rise in respiration called climacteric. The  clirnacteric peak is obtained very fast when temperature is relatively high.  Respiration is a most deteriorating process of the harvested fruits and  vegetables which leads to the oxidative breakdown of the complex materials  (carbohydrates or acids) of cell into simpler molecules (CO2 and  water) with the concurrent production of energy required by the cell for the  completion of chemical reactions. In brief, the process of respiration can be  summed up with the following reaction:<br />

                  <strong>USE  OF CHEMICALS FOR INCREASING SHELF LIFE OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLE</strong><br />
                  <strong>(A)  Ethylene absorbent</strong><br />
                  Ethylene is responsible for  decreasing shelf life. Putting KMNO4 @ 100 ppm soaked filter paper  can minimized ripening and increase shelf life. In Banana this method is very  useful.<br />
                  <strong>(B)  Antifungal Agents</strong><br />
                  • SOPP: Sodium orthophenylphenate<br />
                  • Diphenyl wraps protection against  moulds, stem-end rot.<br />
                  • Dibromoletrachloroethane and  esters give better flavour.<br />
