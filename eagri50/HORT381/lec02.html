                    <strong>I.  MATURITY</strong><br />
			    <p>It is the stage of fully development  of tissue of fruit and vegetables only after which it will ripen normally.  During the process of maturation the fruit receives a regular supply of food  material from the plant. When mature, the abscission or corky layer which forms  at the stern end stops this inflow. Afterwards, the fruit depend on its own  reserves, carbohydrates are dehydrated and sugars accumulate until the sugar  acid ratio form. In addition to this, typical flavour and characteristic colour  also develop. it has been determined that the stage of maturity at the time of  picking influence the storage life and quality of fruit, when picked immature  like mango develop white patches or air pockets during ripening and lacking in  normal brix acid ratio or sugar acid ratio, taste and flavour on the other hand  if the fruits are harvested over mature or full ripe they are easy susceptible  to microbial and physiological spoilage and their storage life is considerably  reduce. Such fruits persist numerous problems during handling, storage and  transportation. Therefore, it is necessary or essential to pick up the fruits  or vegetables at correct stage of maturity to facilitate proper ripening,  distant transportation and maximum storage life.</p>

			      It is a developmental stage of the  fruit on the tree, which will result in a satisfactory product after harvest.<br />
                  <strong>Physiological  maturity</strong> <br />
			      It refers to the stage in the  development of the fruits and vegetables when maximum growth and maturation has  occurred. It is usually associated with full ripening in the fruits. The  Physiological mature stage is followed by senescence.<br />
                  <strong>Commercial  maturity</strong> <br />
			      It is the state of plant organ  required by a market. It commonly bears little relation to Physiological  maturity and may occur at any stage during development stage.<br />
                  <strong>Harvest  Maturity</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>It may be defined in  terms of Physiological maturity and horticultural maturity, it is a stage,  which will allow fruits / vegetables at its peak condition when it reaches to  the consumers and develop acceptable flavour or appearance and having adequate  shelf life.</p>

                    <strong>            S</strong>weet corn is  harvested at immature stage, smaller cobs marketed as baby corn. Okra and cow  pea are harvested at mature stage (pre fiber stage). In chilli, bottle gourd,  bitter gourd, cluster beans maturity is related to their size. Cabbage head and  cauliflower curd are harvested before un pleasant flavour.<br />
                    <strong>Abscission  and firmness</strong> <br />
                  Musk melon should be harvested at  the formation of abscission layer. In cabbage and lettuce should be harvested  at firmness stage.<br />
  <strong>Factors  affecting  maturity</strong><br />
  <strong>1.  Temperature: </strong>Higher temperature gives early maturity.<br />
                  e.g.  Gulabi (Pink) grapes mature in 100 days in Western India but only 82 days are  enough in the warmer Northern India.<br />
                  Lemon  and guava takes less time to mature in summer than in winter. Sun-scorched  portions of fruits are characterized by chlorophyll loss, yellowing,  disappearance of starch and other alcohol insoluble material, increase in TSS  content, decrease in acidity and softening.<br />
  <strong>2.  Soil:</strong> Soil on which the fruit tree is grown affects the time  of maturity.<br />
                  e.g.  Grapes are harvested earlier on light sandy soils than on heavy clays.<br />
  <strong>3.  Size of planting material:</strong> This factor in propagated fruits  affects fruit maturity.<br />
                  e.g.  In pineapple, the number of days taken from flowering to fruit maturity was  more by planting large suckers and slips than by smaller ones.<br />
  <strong>4.  Closer spacing:</strong> Close spacing of hill bananas hastened  maturity.<br />
  <strong>5. Pruning intensity</strong><strong>:</strong> It enhanced the maturity of  Flordasun and sharbati Peaches.<br />
  <strong>6. Girdling</strong><strong>:</strong> Process of constricting the  periphery of a stem which blocks the downward translocation of CHO, hormones,  etc. Beyond the constriction which rather accumulates above it. In Grape vines  it hastens maturity, reduces the green berries in unevenly maturity cultivar  and lowers the number of short berries. It is ineffective when done close to  harvest. CPA has an additive effect with girdling<br />
  <strong>MATURITY  INDEX</strong><br />
  <strong>Maturity  index</strong> <br />
                The factors for determining the harvesting of  fruits, vegetables and plantation crops according to consumer’s purpose, type  of commodity, etc and can be judged by visual means (colour, size, shape),  physical means (firmness, softness), chemical analysis (sugar content, acid  content), computation (heat unit and bloom to harvest period), physiological  method(respiration). These are indications by which the maturity is judged.  Various index are as Follows;</p>

                <p><br />
                  <strong>1.  Visual indices</strong> <br />
                  It is most convenient index. Certain  signals on the plant or on the fruit can be used as pointers. E.g. drying of  top leaves in banana, yellowing of last leaf of Peduncle in jackfruit. Flow of  sap from cut fruit stalk of mango slows down if the harvest is done after  maturity but in immature fruits, exudation is more and comes with force in a  jet form. in papaya, the latex becomes almost watery. The flow gets reduced on  maturity in Sapota. In fruits like banana and Sapota, floral ends become more  brittle and shed with a gentle touch or even on their own. In Sapota, the brown  scurf on the fruit skin starts propping. In mango, lenticels become more  prominent and the waxy bloom gradually disappears. Grapes develop translucent  bloom. Other changes like angularity in banana, development of creamy wide  space between custard apple segments and the flattening of the eyes in  pineapple and tubercles in litchi serve as reliable maturity indices. <br />
                  <strong>2.  Seed development</strong> <br />
                  It can also be used as an index of  fruit maturity, e.g. endocarp hardening for stone and fiber development for  dessert in mango.<br />
                  <strong>3.  Start of bud damage</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Occasionally it can  be used as an index of fruit maturity in mango. <br />
                  <strong>4.  Calendar date</strong> </p>            
                For  perennial fruit crops grown in seasonal climate which are more or less uniform  from year to year, calendar date for harvest is a reliable guide to commercial  maturity. This approach relies on a reproducible date for the time of the  flowering and a relative constant growth period from flowering through to  maturity. Time of flowering is largely dependent on temperature, and
the  variation in number of days from flowering to harvest can be calculated for  some commodities by use of the degree- concept.<br />
  <strong>5.  Heat units</strong> <br />
             Harvest date of newly introduced fruits in a  widely varying climate can be predicted with the help of heat unit. For each  cultivar the heat requirement for fruit growth and development can be  calculated in terms of degree days: Maturity at higher temperature is faster as  the heat requirement is met earlier. This heat unit helps in planning,  planting, harvesting and factory programmes for crops such as corn, peas and  tomato for processing.<br />
<strong>MATURITY  OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES </strong><br />
<strong>Banana</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>The  fruit is harvested when the ridges on the surface of skin change from  angularity to round i.e. after the attainment of 3% full stages. Dwarf banana  are ready for harvest within 11-14 months after planting while tall cultivars  takes about 14-16 months to harvest. Peel colour change from dark green to  light green the remaining style ends were dry, and brittle and fruits were less  angular in shape.<br />
<strong>Guava</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>TSS  acid ratio, specific gravity and colour are determined the maturity in guava.  For e.g.<br />
            Allahabad safeda        - 35.81<br />
            Apple colour guava     - 26.39<br />
            Chittidar guava            - 28.13<br />
            Lucknow                     - 49 -34.25<br />
            Specific gravity           - Less than I<br />
            Colour                                     - Light green to yellow.<br />
<strong>Ber</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>In ber maturity is  judged by colour (yellow), specific gravity (less than 1) and TSS<br />
<strong>Pomegranate</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>Sugar percentage  should be 12-16% and acid percentage 1.5—2.5%, variety Ganesh harvest when seed  colour becomes pink. In this stage TSS 12.5% and sugar acid ratio 19.5%.<br />
<strong>Bael</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>It takes one year for  fruiting after flowering. It is the fruit which ripen after one year of  flowering. April start harvesting and may end it start in flowering.<br />
<strong>Mango</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>This can be judged  when one or two mangoes ripen on the tree are fall on the ground of their own  accord. This process of fallen is known as tapaca specific gravity 1,01—1.02  and TSS 10-14%.<br />

				<p><strong>II.  HARVESTING</strong><br />
				  The goals of harvesting are to  gather a commodity from the field at the proper level of maturity with a  minimum of damage and loss, as rapidly as possible and at a minimum cost. This  is achieved through hand-harvesting in most fruit, vegetable and flower crops.<br />
  <strong>1.  Hand Harvesting</strong> <br />
				  Hand harvesting has a number of  advantages over machine harvest. People can accurately determine product  quality, allowing accurate selection of mature product. This is particularly  important for crops that have a wide range of maturity and need to be harvested  several times during the season. Properly trained workers can pick and handle  the product with a minimum of damage. Many fresh-market products have a short  shelf life if they are bruised or damaged during harvest and handling. The rate  of harvest can easily be increased by hiring more workers. Hand- harvesting  also requires a minimum of capital investment. The main problem with hand harvesting  is labor management. Labor supply is a problem for growers who cannot offer a  long employment season. Labor strikes during the harvest period can be costly.  In spite of these problems, quality is so important to marketing fresh- market  commodities successfully that hand harvesting remains the dominant method of  harvest of most fruits and vegetables and for all cut flowers.<br />
				  Effective use of hand labor requires  careful management. New employees must be trained to harvest the product at the  required quality and at an acceptable rate of productivity. Employees must know  what level of performance and must be encouraged and trained to reach that  level. <br />
  <strong>2.  Mechanical Harvesting</strong><br />
				  Mechanical harvest is currently used  for fresh-market crops that are roots, tubers, or rhizomes and for nut crops.  Vegetables that are grown below ground (radishes, potatoes, garlic, carrots,  beets and others) are always harvested only once and the soil can be used to  cushion the product from machine caused mechanical injury. Tree nuts and  peanuts are protected by a shell and easily withstand mechanical handling. A  number of products destined for processing such as tomatoes, wine grapes,  beans, peas, prunes, peachesand some leafy green vegetables are machine  harvested because harvest damage does not significantly affect the quality of  processed product. This is often because the product is processed quickly after  harvest. These crops have also been amenable to new production techniques and  breeding that allow the crop to be better suited to mechanical harvest.<br />
				  The main advantage of mechanical  harvest equipment is that machines can often harvest at high rates. Tree nut  harvesters, for eg. attaching  a shaking  mechanism to the tree and remove most of the nuts in few seconds. The nuts are either  caught on a fabric- covered frame or picked up from the ground by other  machines. This allows an orchard to be harvested very quickly compared to  handshaking with poles. Machine harvest also reduces management problems  associated with workers. The commodity must be grown to accept mechanical  harvest.  <br />
  <strong>Demerits  of Mechanical Harvesting</strong><br />
				  Machines are rarely capable of  selective harvest. Mechanical harvesting will not be feasible until the crop or  production techniques can be modified to allow one time harvest. Harvesting  machines often causes excessive product perennial crops eg. Bark damage from a  tree shaker. The harvesting machines are quite expensive. <br />
  <strong>III.  POST HARVEST HANDLING</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Being living organs,  fruits and vegetables continue to respire even after harvesting when they have  a limited source of food reserves. In addition to degradation of respiratory  substrates, a number of changes in taste, colour, flavour, texture and  appearance take place in the harvested commodities which make them unacceptable  for consumption by the consumers if these are not handled properly. Post  harvest technology starts immediately after the harvest of fruits and  vegetables. The whole process of processing the commodities is categorized as  Handling of fresh produce. Post harvest Technology of fresh fruits and  vegetables combines the biological and environmental factors in the process of  value addition of a commodity. <br />
  <strong>1.  Precooling</strong><br />
				  Precooling (prompt cooling after  harvest) is important for most of the fruits and vegetables because they may  deteriorate as much in 1 hr at 32°C. In addition to removal of field heat from  commodities, precooling also reduces bruise damage from vibration during  transit. Cooling requirement for a crop vary with the air temperature during  harvesting, stage of maturity and nature of crop.<br />
				  There are many methods of precooling  viz, cold air (room cooling, forced air cooling), cold water (hydrocooling),  direct contact with ice (contact icing), evaporation of water from the produce  (evaporative cooling, vacuum cooling) and combination of vacuum and  hydrocooling (hydrovac cooling). Some chemicals (nutrients/growth regulators/  fungicides) can also be mixed with the water used in hydrocooling to prolong  the shelf life by improving nutrient status of crop and preventing the spread  of post harvest diseases. <br />
  <strong>2.  Washing, Cleaning and Trimming</strong><br />
				  Before fresh fruits and vegetables  are marketed various amounts of cleaning are necessary which typically involves  the removal of soil dust, adhering debris, insects and spray residues. Chlorine  in fresh water is often used as disinfectant to wash the commodity. Some  fungicides like Diphenylamine (0.1 - 0.25%) or ethoxyquin (0.2 - 0.5%) may be  used as post harvest dip to control the disorders.  Eg. Apple superficial scald. For cleaning of  some fruit type vegetables (melons, brinjals, tomatoes, cucumber) they should  be wiped with damp cloth. Many vegetable need trimming, cutting and removal of  unsightly leaves or other vegetative parts.<br />
  <strong>3.  Sorting, Grading and Sizing</strong><br />
				  Sorting is done by hand to remove  the fruits which are unsuitable to market or storage due to damage by insects,  diseases or mechanical injuries. The remainder crop product is separated into  two or more grades on the basis of the surface colour, shape or visible  defects. For eg, in an apple packing house in India 3 grades viz. Extra Fancy,  Fancy and standard may be packed for marketing. The fourth “cull” grade is  meant for processing. After sorting and grading, sizing is done either by hand  or machine. Machine sizers work on two basic principles: weight and diameter.  Sizing on the basis of fruit shape and size are most effective for spherical  (Oranges, tomato, certain apple cultivars) and elongated (Delicious apples and  European pears or of non-uniform shape) commodities, respectively. </p>

				  Curing is an effective operation to  reduce the water loss during storage from hardy vegetables viz, onion, garlic,  sweet potato and other tropical root vegetables. The curing methods employed  for root crops are entirely different than that from the bulbous crops (onions  and garlic). The curing of root and tuber crops develops periderms over cut,  broken or skinned surfaces wound restoration. It helps in the healing of  harvest injuries, reduces loss of water and prevents the infection by decay  pathogens.<br />
				  Onions and garlic are cured to dry  the necks and outer scales. For the curing of onion and garlic, the bulbs are  left in the field after harvesting under shade for a few days until the green  tops, outer skins and roots are fully dried. <br />
                  <strong>5.  Waxing</strong><br />
				  Quality retention is a major  consideration in modem fresh fruit marketing system. Waxes are esters of higher  fatty acid with monohydric alcohols and hydrocarbons and some free fatty acids.  But coating applied to the surface of fruit is commonly called waxes whether or  not any component is actually a wax. Waxing generally reduces the respiration  and transpiration rates, but other chemicals such as fungicides, growth  regulators, preservative can also be incorporated specially for reducing  microbial spoilage, sprout inhibition etc. However, it should be remembered  that waxing does not improve the quality of any inferior horticulture product  but it can be a beneficial adjunct to good handling.<br />
				  The  advantages of wax application are:<br />
				  ­- Improved appearances of fruit.<br />
				  - Reduced moisture losses and  retards wilting and shrivelling during storage of fruits.<br />
				  - Less spoilage specially due to  chilling injury and browning.<br />
				  - Creates diffusion barrier as a  result of which it reduces the availability of 02 to the tissues thereby  reducing respiration rate.<br />
				  -  Protects fruits from micro-biological  infection.<br />
				  - Considered a cost effective  substitute in the reduction of spoilage when refrigerated storage is  unaffordable.<br />
				  - Wax coating are used as carriers  for sprout inhibitors, growth regulators and preservatives.<br />
				  The principal disadvantage of wax  coating is the development of off- flavour if not applied properly. Adverse  flavour changes have been attributed to inhibition of O2 and CO2  exchange thus, resulting in anaerobic respiration and elevated ethanol  and acetaldehyde contents. Paraffm wax, Carnauba wax, Bee wax, Shellac, Wood  resins and Polyethylene waxes used commercially.<br />
                  <strong>6.  Packaging</strong><br />
				  Proper or scientific packaging of  fresh fruits and vegetables reduces the wastage of commodities by protecting  them from mechanical damage, pilferage, dirt, moisture loss and other  undesirable physiological changes and pathological deterioration during the  course of storage, transportation and subsequent marketing. For providing,  uniform quality to packed produce, the commodity should be carefully supervised  and sorted prior to packaging. Packaging cannot improve the quality but it  certainly helps in maintaining it as it protects produce against the hazards of  journey. Striking developments have been in the field of packaging of  horticultural produce and the gunny bags, grasses and stem leaves used so far  for packaging are now being replaced by a variety of containers such as wooden  boxes, baskets woven from bamboo or twigs, sack/jute bags and corrugated fibre  board (CFB) boxes. <br />
                  <strong>7.  Storage</strong><br />
				  A number of storage techniques  (ground storage, ambient storage, refrigerated storage, air cooled storage,  zero energy storage, modified atmospheric storage, hypobaric storage and  controlled atmosphere storage) are being used for fruits and vegetables  depending upon the nature of the commodity and the storage period intended.</p>
