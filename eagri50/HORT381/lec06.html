				<p>A- Primary causes of loss:  Those are directly affect the food  <br />
                  <strong>2.1- Enzymic changes</strong> <br />
     Enzymes which are endogenous to plant  tissues can have undesirable or   desirable consequences. <br />
Examples involving enzymic  changes include:<br />
2.1.1-  the post-harvest spoilage of fruit and vegetables<br />
2.1.2-  oxidation of phenolic substances in plant tissues by phenolase (leading to   browning)<br />
2.1.3-  sugar - starch conversion in plant tissues by amylases<br />
2.1.4-  post-harvest demethylation of pectic substances in plant tissues (leading to  softening of plant tissues during ripening, and firming of plant tissues  during   processing). <br />
     The major factors useful in controlling  enzyme activity are: </p>
				<ol>
				  <li><span dir="rtl"> </span><span dir="ltr">temperature</span></li>
				  <li><span dir="rtl"> </span><span dir="ltr">water activity</span></li>
				  <li><span dir="rtl"> </span><span dir="ltr">pH</span></li>
				  <li><span dir="rtl"> </span><span dir="ltr">chemicals which can inhibit  enzyme action</span></li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>2.2- Chemical changes</strong> <br />
                    <strong>2.2.1- Sensory quality</strong> <br />
				  The two major chemical changes which  occur during the processing and  storage  of foods and lead to a deterioration in sensory quality are lipid oxidation and  non-enzymatic browning. Chemical reactions are also responsible for changes in  the colour and flavour of foods during processing and storage. <br />
				  2.2.1.1-  Lipid oxidation rate and course of reaction is influenced by light, local   oxygen concentration, high temperature, the  presence of catalysts (generally transition metals such as iron and copper) and  water activity. Control of these factors can significantly reduce the extent of  lipid oxidation in foods. <br />
				  2.2.1.2-  Non-enzymic browning is one of the major causes of deterioration which occurs  during storage of dried and concentrated foods. </p>
				<p>2.2.1.3-  Colour changes <br />
				  Almost any type of food processing  or storage causes some deterioration of the chlorophyll pigments. This reaction  is accelerated by heat and is acid catalysed. <br />
				  2.2.1.4- Flavour changes <br />
				  In fruit and vegetables,  enzymically generated compounds derived from      long-chain fatty acids play an extremely important role in the formation  of characteristic flavors. In addition, these types of reactions can lead to  significant off-flavors.  <br />
				  The permeability of packaging  materials is of importance in retaining      desirable volatile components within packages, or in permitting  undesirable  components to permeate  through the package from the ambient atmosphere. </p>
				<p><strong>2.2.2- Nutritional quality</strong> <br />
				  The four major factors which affect  nutrient degradation and can be     controlled to varying extents by packaging are </p>
				<ol>
				  <li><span dir="rtl"> </span><span dir="ltr">light</span></li>
				  <li><span dir="rtl"> </span><span dir="ltr">oxygen concentration</span></li>
				  <li><span dir="rtl"> </span><span dir="ltr">temperature</span></li>
				  <li><span dir="rtl"> </span><span dir="ltr">water activity. </span></li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>2.3- Physical changes</strong> <br />
				  One major undesirable physical change in food  is the absorption of moisture as a consequence of an inadequate barrier  provided by the package; this results in caking. It can occur either as a  result of a poor selection of packaging material in the first place, or failure  of the package integrity during storage. In general, moisture absorption is  associated with increased cohesiveness. </p>
				<p><strong>2.4- Biological changes</strong> <br />
                    <strong>2.4.1- Microbiological</strong> <br />
				  Micro-organisms  can make both desirable and undesirable changes to the quality of foods  depending on whether or not they are introduced as an essential part of the  food preservation process or arise unintentionally and subsequently grow to  produce food spoilage. <br />
				  The two  major groups of micro-organisms found in foods are bacteria and fungi, the  latter consisting of yeasts and moulds. Bacteria are generally the fastest  growing, so that in conditions favourable to both, bacteria will usually  outgrow fungi. <br />
				  Foods  are frequently classified on the basis of their stability as non-perishable,  semi-perishable and perishable. <br />
				  The  protection of packaged food from contamination or attack by micro-organisms  depends on the mechanical integrity of the package (e.g. the absence of breaks  and seal imperfections), and on the resistance of the package to penetration by  micro-organisms. </p>
				<p><strong>2.4.2- Macrobiological</strong> <br />
				  2.4.2.1  Insect Pests <br />
				  Warm  humid environments promote insect growth, although most insects will not breed  if the temperature exceeds about 35 C° or falls below 10 C°. Also many insects  cannot reproduce satisfactorily unless the moisture content of their food is  greater than about 11%. <br />
				  2.4.2.2  Rodents <br />
				  Rats and  mice carry disease-producing organisms on their feet and/or in their intestinal  tracts and are known to harbour salmonella of serotypes frequently associated  with food-borne infections in humans. <br />
  <strong>B- Secondary </strong>causes of loss: Those lead to  conditions that encourage a primary cause of loss such as:<br />
				  1- Inadequate harvesting,  packaging and handling skills. <br />
				  2- Lack of adequate  containers for the transport and handling of perishables. <br />
				  3-  Storage facilities inadequate to protect the food. <br />
				  4- Transportation inadequate  to move the food to market before it spoils. <br />
				  5- Inadequate refrigerated  storage. <br />
				  6- Inadequate drying  equipment or poor drying season. <br />
				  7- traditional processing and  marketing systems can be responsible for high losses. <br />
				  8-  Legal standards can affect the retention or rejection of food for human use. <br />
				  10- Knowledge of management  is essential for maintaining tool   <br />
				  in good condition during marketing and  storage. <br />
				  11- Bumper crops can overload  the post-harvest handling system or exceed the   consumption need and cause excessive wastage. </p>
				<p><strong>3- Sites of losses</strong> <br />
				  Losses  may occur anywhere from the point where the food has been harvested or gathered  up to the point of consumption. Losses can occur during one of the following  processes:<br />
				  1- Harvest. The separation of the commodity from the plant  that produced it. <br />
				  2- Preparation. The  preliminary separation or extraction of the edible from the non- edible  portion. <br />
				  3- Preservation. The  prevention of lose and spoilage of foods. For example, the sun-drying of fruit,  the use of refrigeration and the use of fungicides to inhibit mold growth in  fruits. <br />
				  4- Processing. The conversion  of edible food into another form more acceptable or more convenient to the  consumer, for example, the manufacture of fruit juice and the canning of fruits  and vegetables. <br />
				  5- Storage. The holding of  foods until consumption. Most storage is common storage (ambient temperature)  but there are extensive storage capacities that can hold food under  refrigerated or controlled atmosphere conditions. <br />
				  6- Transportation. All forms  of transportation are used to convey foods from the point of production to the  ultimate point of consumption. </p>
