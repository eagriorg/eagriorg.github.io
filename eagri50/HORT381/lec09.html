			    <p>Packaging fresh fruits and  vegetables is one of the more important steps in the long and complicated  journey from grower to consumer. Bags, crates, hampers, baskets, cartons, bulk  bins, and palletized containers are convenient containers for handling,  transporting, and marketing fresh produce. More than 1,500 different types of  packages are used for produce in the U.S. and the number continues to increase  as the industry introduces new packaging materials and concepts. Although the  industry generally agrees that container standardization is one way to reduce  cost, the trend in recent years has moved toward a wider range of package sizes  to accommodate the diverse needs of wholesalers, consumers, food service  buyers, and processing operations. <br />
			    Packing and packaging materials  contribute a significant cost to the produce industry; therefore it is  important that packers, shippers, buyers, and consumers have a clear  understanding of the wide range of packaging options available. This fact sheet  describes some of the many types of packaging, including their functions, uses,  and limitations. Also included is a listing, by commodity, of the common  produce containers standard to the industry. </p>

<p>
  <strong>The  Function of Packaging or Why package Produce?</strong> <br />
				  A significant percentage of produce  buyer and consumer complaints may be traced to container failure because of  poor design or inappropriate selection and use. A properly designed produce  container should contain, protect, and identify the produce, satisfying  everyone from grower to consumer. <br />
  <strong>PACKAGING  POINTS </strong> <br />
  <strong>Recyclability/Biodegradability<br />
  </strong>            A growing number of U.S. markets and  many export markets have waste disposal restrictions for packaging materials.  In the near future, almost all produce packaging will be recyclable or  biodegradable, or both. Many of the largest buyers of fresh produce are also  those most concerned about environmental issues. <br />
  <strong>Variety<br />
  </strong>            The trend is toward greater use of  bulk packages for processors and wholesale buyers and smaller packages for  consumers. There are now more than 1,500 different sizes and styles of produce  packages. <br />
  <strong>Sales  Appeal</strong><br />
				  High quality graphics are  increasingly being used to boost sales appeal. Multi-color printing,  distinctive lettering, and logos are now common. <br />
  <strong>Shelf  Life</strong><br />
				  Modern produce packaging can be  custom engineered for each commodity to extend shelf life and reduce waste.<br />
  <strong>Containment </strong><br />
				  The container must enclose the  produce in convenient units for handling and distribution. The produce should  fit well inside the container, with little wasted space. Small produce items  that are spherical or oblong (such as potatoes, onions, and apples) may be  packaged efficiently utilizing a variety of different package shapes and sizes.  However, many produce items such as asparagus, berries, or soft fruit may  require containers specially designed for that item. packages of produce  commonly handled by hand are usually limited to 50 pounds. Bulk packages moved  by fork lifts may weigh as much as 1,200 pounds. <br />
  <strong>Protection </strong><br />
				  The package must protect the produce  from mechanical damage and poor environmental conditions during handling and  distribution. To produce buyers, torn, dented, or collapsed produce packages  usually indicate lack of care in handling the contents. Produce containers must  be sturdy enough to resist damage during packaging, storage, and transportation  to market. Because almost all produce packages are palletized, produce  containers should have sufficient stacking strength to resist crushing in a low  temperature, high humidity environment. Although the cost of packaging  materials has escalated sharply in recent years, poor quality, lightweight  containers that are easily damaged by handling or moisture are no longer  tolerated by packers or buyers. Produce destined for export markets requires  that containers to be extra sturdy. Air-freighted produce may require special  packing, package sizes, and insulation. Marketers who export fresh produce  should consult with freight companies about any special packaging requirements.  Additionally, the USDA and various state export agencies may be able to provide  specific packaging information. <br />
				  Damage resulting from poor  environmental control during handling and transit is one of the leading causes  of rejected produce and low buyer and consumer satisfaction. Each fresh fruit  and vegetable commodity has its own requirements for temperature, humidity, and  environmental gas composition. Produce containers should be produce friendly - helping to  maintain an optimum environment for the longest shelf life. This may include  special materials to slow the loss of water from the produce, insulation  materials to keep out the heat, or engineered plastic liners that maintain a  favorable mix of oxygen and carbon dioxide. </p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Identification </strong><br />
				  The package must identify and  provide useful information about the produce. It is customary (and may be  required in some cases) to provide information such as the produce name, brand,  size, grade, variety, net weight, count, grower, shipper, and country of  origin. It is also becoming more common to find included on the package,  nutritional information, recipes, and other useful information directed  specifically at the consumer. In consumer marketing, pack- age appearance has  also become an important part of point of sale displays. <br />
				  Universal Product Codes (UPC or bar  codes) may be included as part of the labeling. The UPCs used in the food  industry consist of a ten-digit machine readable code. The first five digits  are a number assigned to the specific producer (packer or shipper) and the  second five digits represent specific product information such as type of  produce and size of package. Although no price information is included, UPCs  are used more and more by packers, shippers, buyers, and Example of a UPC  retailers as a fast and convenient method of inventory control and cost  accounting. Efficient use of UPCs requires coordination with everyone who  handles the package. <br />
                  <strong>Types  of Packaging Materials </strong> <br />
                  <strong>Wood </strong><br />
                  <strong>Pallets</strong> literally form the base on which most fresh produce is delivered to the  consumer. Pallets were first used during World War II as an efficient way to  move goods. The produce industry uses approximately 190 of the 700 million  pallets produced per year in<br />
				  the U.S.. About 40 percent of these are  single-use pallets. Because many are of a non-standard size, the pallets are  built as inexpensively as possible and discarded after a single use. Although  standardization efforts have been slowly under way for many years, the efforts  have been accelerated by pressure from environmental groups, in addition to the  rising cost of pallets and landfill tipping fees. <br />
				  Over the years, the 40-inch wide, by  48-inch long pallet has evolved as the unofficial standard size.  Standardization encourages re-use, which has many benefits. Besides reducing  cost because they may be used many times, most pallet racks and automated  pallet handling equipment are designed for standard-size pallets. Standard size  pallets make efficient use of truck and van space and can accommodate heavier  loads and more stress than lighter single-use pallets. Additionally, the use of  a single pallet size could substantially reduce pallet inventory and  warehousing costs along with pallet repair and disposal costs. The adoption of  a pallet standard throughout the produce industry would also aid efforts toward  standardization of produce containers. <br />
				  In the early 1950s, an alternative  to the pallet was introduced. It is a pallet-size sheet (slipsheet) of corrugated  fiberboard or plastic (or a combination of these materials) with a narrow lip  along one or more sides. packages of produce are stacked directly on this sheet  as if it were a pallet. Once the packages are in place, they are moved by a  specially equipped fork lift equipped with a thin metal sheet instead of forks. <br />
				  Slipsheets are considerably less  expensive than pallets to buy, store, and maintain; they may be re-used many  times; and they reduce the tare weight of the load. However, they require the  use of a special fork-lift attachment at each handling point from packer to  retailer.<br />
				  Depending on the size of produce  package, a single pallet may carry from 20 to over 100 individual packages.  Because these packages are often loosely stacked to allow for air circulation,  or are bulging and difficult to stack evenly, they must be secured (unitized)  to prevent shifting during handling and transit. Although widely used, plastic  straps and tapes may not have completely satisfactory results. Plastic or paper  corner tabs should always be used to prevent the straps from crushing the  corners of packages. <br />
				  Plastic  stretch film is also widely used to secure produce packages. A good film must  stretch, retain its elasticity, and cling to the packages. Plastic film may  conform easily to various size loads. It helps protect the packages from loss  of moisture, makes the pallet more secure against pilferage, and can be applied  using partial automation. However, plastic film severely restricts proper  ventilation. A common alternative to stretch film is plastic netting, which is  much better for stabilizing some pallet loads, such as those that require  forced-air cooling. Used stretch film and plastic netting may be difficult to  properly handle and recycle. <br />
				  A very low-cost and almost fully  automated method of pallet stabilization is the application of a small amount  of special glue to the top of each package. As the packages are stacked, the  glue secures all cartons together. This glue has a low tensile strength so  cartons may be easily separated or repositioned, but a high shear strength so  they will not slide. The glue does not present disposal or recycling problems. <br />
                  <strong>Pallet  Bins</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Substantial wooden  pallet bins of milled lumber or.plywood are primarily used to move produce from  the field or orchard to the packing house. Depending on the application,  capacities may range from 12 to more than 50 bushels. Although the height may  vary, the length and width is generally the same as a standard pallet (48  inches by 40 inches). More efficient double-wide pallet bins (48 inches by 80  inches) are becoming more common in some produce operations. </p>
				            
				<p>Most  pallet bins are locally made; therefore it is very important that they be  consistent from lot to lot in materials, construction, and especially size. For  example, small differences in
				  overall  dimensions Pallet bin can add up to big problems when several hundred are  stacked together for cooling, ventilation, or storage. It is also important  that stress points be adequately reinforced. The average life of a hardwood  pallet bin that is stored outside is approximately five years. When properly  protected from the weather, pallets bins may have a useful life of 10 years or  more. <br />
				  Uniform voluntary standards for wood  pallets and other wood containers are administered by the National Wooden  Pallet and Container Association, Washington, DC. Additionally, the American  Society of Agricultural Engineers, St. Joseph, Michigan, publishes standards  for agricultural pallet bins (ASAE S337.1). <br />
				  <strong>Wire-Bound  Crates</strong><br />
				  <strong>            </strong> Although alternatives are available, wooden  wire-bound crates are used extensively for snap beans, sweet corn and several  other commodities that require hydrocooling. Wire-bound crates are sturdy,  rigid and have very high stacking strength that is essentially unaffected by  water. Wire-bound crates come in many different sizes from half- bushel to  pallet-bin size and have a great deal of open space to facilitate cooling and  ventilation. Although few are re-used, wire-bound crates may be dissembled after  use and shipped back to the packer (flat). In some areas, used containers may  pose a significant disposal problem. Wirebound crates are not generally  acceptable for consumer packaging because of the difficulty in affixing  suitable labels. <br />
				  <strong>Wooden  Crates and Lugs</strong><br />
			    <strong>            </strong>Wooden crates, once  extensively used for apples, stone fruit, and potatoes have been almost totally  replaced by other types of containers. The relative expense of the container, a  greater concern for tare weight, and advances in material handling have reduced  their use to a few specialty items, such as expensive tropical fruit. The 15-,  20-, and 25-pound wooden lugs still used for bunch grapes and some specialty  crops are being gradually replaced with less costly alternatives. </p>
				<p><center><img src="images/Old_Wooden_Fruit_Crates.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="302" /></center><br />
				  <strong>Wooden  Baskets and Hampers</strong><br />
				  <strong>            </strong>Wire-reinforced wood  veneer baskets and hampers of different sizes were once used for a wide variety  of crops from strawberries to sweet potatoes. They are durable and may be  nested for efficient transport when empty. However, cost, disposal problems,  and difficulty in efficient palletization have severely limited their use to  mostly local grower markets where they may be re-used many times. <br />
				  <strong>Corrugated Fiberboard </strong><br />
				  Corrugated fiberboard (often  mistakenly called cardboard or pasteboard) is manufactured in many different  styles and weights. Because of its relativity low cost and versatility, it is  the dominant produce container material and will probably remain so in the near  future. The strength and serviceability of corrugated fiberboard have been  improving in recent years. <br />
				  Most corrugated fiberboard is made  from three or more layers of paperboard manufactured by the kraft process. To  be considered paperboard, the paper must be thicker than 0.008 inches. The  grades of paperboard are differentiated by their weight (in pounds per 1,000  square feet) and their thickness. Kraft paper made from unbleached pulp has a  characteristic brown color and is exceptionally strong. In addition to virgin  wood fibers, Kraft paper may have some portion of synthetic fibers for  additional strength, sizing (starch), and other materials to give it wet  strength and printability. Most fiberboard contains some recycled fibers.  Minimum amounts of recycled materials may be specified by law and the  percentage is expected to increase in the future. Tests have shown that cartons  of fully recycled pulp have about 75 percent of the stacking strength of virgin  fiber containers. The use of recycled fibers will inevitably lead to the use of  thicker walled containers. <br />
				  Double-faced corrugated fiberboard  is the predominant form used for produce containers. It is produced by  sandwiching a layer of corrugated paperboard between an inner and outer liner  (facing) of paper-board. The inner and outer liner may be identical, or the  outer layer may be preprinted or coated to better accept printing. The inner  layer may be given a special coating to resist moisture. Heavy-duty shipping  containers, such as corrugated bulk bins that are required to have high  stacking strength, may have double- or even triple-wall construction.  Corrugated fiberboard manufacturers print box certificates on the bottom of  containers to certify certain strength characteristics and limitations. There  are two types of certification. The first certifies the minimum combined weight  of both the inner and outer facings and that the corrugated fiberboard material  is of a minimum bursting strength. The second certifies minimum edge crush test  (ETC) strength. Edge crush strength is a much better predictor of stacking  strength than is bursting strength. For this reason, users of corrugated  fiberboard containers should insist on ECT certification to compare the  stackability of various containers. Both certificates give a maximum size limit  for the container (sum of length, width, and height) and the maximum gross  weight of the contents.<br />
				  Both cold temperatures and high  humidities reduce the strength of fiberboard containers. Unless the container  is specially treated, moisture absorbed from the surrounding air and the  contents can reduce the strength of the container by as much as 75 percent. New  anti-moisture coatings (both wax and plastic) are now available to  substantially reduce the effects of moisture. <br />
				  Waxed fiberboard cartons (the wax is  about 20 percent of fiber weight) are used for many produce items that must be  either hydrocooled or iced. The main objection to wax cartons is disposal after  use— wax cartons cannot be recycled and are increasingly being refused at  landfills. Several states and municipalities have recently taxed wax cartons or  have instituted rigid back haul regulations. Industry sources suggest that wax  cartons will eventually be replaced by plastic or, more likely, the use of ice  and hydrocooling will be replaced by highly controlled forced-air cooling and  rigid temperature and humidity maintenance on many commodities. <br />
				  In many applications for corrugated  fiberboard containers, the stacking strength of the container is a minor  consideration. For example, canned goods carry the majority of their own weight  when stacked. Fresh produce usually cannot carry much of the vertical load  without some damage. Therefore, one of the primarily desired characteristics of  corrugated fiberboard containers is stacking strength to protect the produce  from crushing. Because of their geometry, most of the stacking strength of  corrugated containers is carried by the corners. For this reason, hand holes  and ventilation slots should never be positioned near the corners of produce  containers and be limited to no more than 5 to 7 percent of the side area. <br />
				  Interlocking the packages (cross  stacking) is universally practiced to stabilize pallets. Cross stacking places  the corner of one produce package at the middle of the one below it, thus  reducing its stacking strength. To reduce the possibility of collapse, the  first several layers of each pallet should be column stacked (one package  directly above the other). The upper layers of packages may be cross stacked as  usual with very little loss of pallet stability. <br />
				  There are numerous styles of  corrugated fiberboard containers. The two most used in the produce industry are  the one piece, regular slotted container (RSC) and the two piece, full  telescoping container (FTC). The RSC is the most popular because it is simple  and economical. However, the RSC has relatively low stacking strength and  therefore must be used with produce, such as potatoes, that can carry some of  the stacking load. The FTC, actually one container inside another, is used when  greater stack- ing strength and resistance to bulging is required. A third type  of container is the Bliss box, which is — constructed from three separate  pieces of corrugated fiberboard. The Bliss box was developed to be used when  maximum stacking strength is required. The bottoms and tops of all three types  of containers may be closed by glue, staples, or interlocking slots. Almost  all corrugated fiberboard containers are shipped to the packer flat and  assembled at the packing house. To conserve space, assembly is usually  performed just before use.  Assembly may be by hand, machine, or a combination of both. Ease of assembly  should be carefully investigated when considering a particular style of  package. <br />
				              In recent years, large double-wall  or even triple- wall corrugated fiberboard containers have increasingly been  used as one-way pallet bins to ship bulk produce to processors and retailers.  Cabbage, melons, potatoes, pumpkins, and citrus have all been shipped  successfully in these containers. The container cost per pound of produce is as  little as one fourth of traditional size containers. Some bulk containers may  be collapsed and re-used. <br />
				              For many years, labels were printed  on heavy paper and glued or stapled to the produce package. The high cost of  materials and labor has all but eliminated this practice. The ability to print  the brand, size, and grade information directly on the container is one of the  greatest benefits of corrugated fiberboard containers. There are basically two  methods used to print corrugated fiberboard containers: <br />
                  <strong>Post  Printed</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>When the liner is  printed after the corrugated fiberboard has been formed, the process is known  as post printing. Post printing is the most widely used printing method for  corrugated fiberboard containers because it is economical and may be used for  small press runs. However, postprinting produces graphics with less detail and  is usually limited to one or two colors. <br />
                  <strong>Preprinted</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>High quality,  full-color graphics may be obtained by preprinting the linerboard before it is  attached to the corrugated paperboard. Whereas the cost is about 15 percent  more than standard two color containers, the eye catching quality of the  graphics makes it very useful for many situations. The visual quality of the  package influences the perception of the product because the buyer's first  impression is of the outside of the package. Produce managers especially like  high quality graphics that they can use in super market floor displays. <br />
                              Preprinted cartons are usually  reserved for the introduction of new products or new brands. Market research  has shown that exporters may benefit from sophisticated graphics. The increased  cost usually does not justify use for mature products in a stable market, but  this may change as the cost of these containers becomes more competitive. <br />
                  <strong>Pulp  Containers</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Containers made from  recycled paper pulp and a starch binder are mainly used for small consumer  packages of fresh produce. Pulp containers are available in a large variety of  shapes and sizes and are relatively inexpensive in standard sizes. Pulp containers  can absorb surface moisture from the product, which is a benefit for small  fruit and berries that are easily harmed by water. Pulp containers are also  biodegradable, made from recycled materials, and recyclable. <br />
                  <strong>Paper  and Mesh Bags</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Consumer packs of  potatoes and onions are about the only produce items now packed in paper bags.  The more sturdy mesh bag has much wider use. In addition to potatoes and  onions, cabbage, turnips, citrus, and some specialty items are packed in mesh  bags. Sweet corn may still be packaged in mesh bags in some markets. In  addition to its low cost, mesh has the advantage of uninhibited air flow. Good  ventilation is particularly beneficial to onions. Supermarket produce managers  like small mesh bags because they make attractive displays that stimulate  purchases. <br />
                              However, bags of any type have  several serious disadvantages. Large bags do not palletize well and small bags  do not efficiently fill the space inside corrugated fiberboard containers. Bags  do not offer protection from rough handling. Mesh bags provide little  protection from light or contaminants. In addition, produce packed in bags is  correctly perceived by the consumer to be less than the best grade. Few  consumers are willing to pay premium price for bagged produce. <br />
                  <strong>Plastic  Bags</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Plastic bags  (polyethylene film) are the predominant material for fruit and vegetable  consumer packaging. Besides the very low material costs, automated bagging  machines further reduce packing costs. Film bags are clear, allowing for easy  inspection of the contents, and readily accept high quality graphics. Plastic  films are available in a wide range of thicknesses and grades and may be  engineered to control the environmental gases inside the bag. The film material  &quot;breathes&quot; at a rate necessary to maintain the correct mix of oxygen,  carbon dioxide, and water vapor inside the bag. Since each produce item has its  own unique requirement for environmental gases, modified atmosphere packaging  material must be specially engineered for each item. Research has shown that  the shelf life of fresh produce is extended considerably by this packaging. The  explosive growth of precut produce is due in part to the availability of  modified atmosphere packaging. <br />
                              In addition to engineered plastic  films, various patches and valves have been developed that affix to low-cost  ordinary plastic film bags. These devices respond to temperature and control  the mix of environmental gases. <br />
                  <strong>Shrink  Wrap</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>One of the newest  trends in produce packaging is the shrink wrapping of individual produce items.  Shrink wrapping has been used successfully to package potatoes, sweet potatoes,  apples, onions, sweet corn, cucumbers and a variety of tropical fruit. Shrink  wrapping with an engineered plastic wrap can reduce shrinkage, protect the  produce from disease, reduce mechanical damage and provide a good surface for  stick-on labels.</p>
				<p><cENTER><img src="images/shrink-wrapped-jelly-beans.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="250" /> </cENTER><br />
                  <strong>Rigid  Plastic Packages</strong><br />
				  Packages with a top and bottom that  are heat formed from one or two pieces of plastic are known as clamshells.  Clamshells are gaining in popularity because they are inexpensive, versatile,  provide excellent protection to the produce, and present a very pleasing  consumer package. Clamshells are most often used with consumer packs of high  value produce items like small fruit, berries, mushrooms, etc., or items that  are easily damaged by crushing. Clamshells are used extensively with precut  produce and prepared salads. Molded polystyrene and corrugated polystyrene  containers have been test marketed as a substitute for waxed corrugated fiberboard.  At present they are not generally cost competitive, but as environmental  pressures grow, they may be more common. Heavy-molded polystyrene pallet bins  have been adopted by a number of growers as a substitute for wooden pallet  bins. Although at present their cost is over double that of wooden bins, they  have a longer service life, are easier to clean, are recyclable, do not decay  when wet, do not harbor disease, and may be nested and made collapsible. <br />
				  As environmental pressures continue  to grow, the disposal and recyclability of packaging material of all kinds will  become a very important issue. Common polyethylene may take from 200 to 400  years to breakdown in a landfill. The addition of 6 percent starch will reduce  the time to 20 years or less. packaging material companies are developing  starch-based polyethylene substitutes that will break down in a landfill as  fast as ordinary paper. <br />
				  The move to biodegradable or  recyclable plastic packaging materials may be driven by cost in the long term, but  by legislation in the near term. Some authorities have proposed a total ban on  plastics. In this case, the supermarket of the early 21st century may resemble  the grocery markets of the early 20th century. <br />
                  <strong>Standardization  of Packaging </strong> <br />
				  Produce package standardization is  interpreted differently by different groups. The wide variety of package sizes  and material combinations is a result of the market responding to demands from  many different segments of the produce industry. For example, many of the large-volume  buyers of fresh produce are those most concerned with the environment. They  demand less packaging and the use of more recyclable and biodegradable  materials, yet would also like to have many different sizes of packages for  convenience. packers want to limit the variety of packages they must carry in  stock, yet they have driven the trend toward preprinted, individualized  containers. Shippers and trucking companies want to standardize sizes so the  packages may be better palletized and handled. <br />
				  Produce buyers are not a homogeneous  group. Buyers for grocery chains have different needs than buyers for food  service. For grocery items normally sold in bulk, processors want largest size  packages that they can handle efficiently - to minimize unpacking time and  reduce the cost of handling or disposing of the used containers. Produce  managers, on the other hand, want individualized, high quality graphics to  entice retail buyers with in-store displays. <br />
				  Selecting  the right container for fresh produce is seldom a matter of personal choice for  the packer. For each commodity, the market has unofficial, but nevertheless  rigid standards for packaging; therefore it is very risky to use a nonstandard  package. Packaging technology, market acceptability, and disposal regulations  are constantly changing. When choosing a package for fresh fruits and  vegetables, packers must consult the market, and in some markets, standard  packages may be required by law<br />
                  <strong>Packaging  materials in use</strong> <br />
				  A  great variety of materials are used for the packing of perishable commodities.  They include wood, bamboo, rigid and foam plastic, solid cardboard and  corrugated fibre board. The kind of material or structure adopted depends on  the method of perforation,  the distance  to its destination, the value of the product and the requirement of the market.</p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>CFB  Boxes</strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>            Corrugated  fiberboard is the most widely used material for fruit &amp; vegetable packages  because of the following characteristics:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Light  in weight</li>
				  <li>Reasonably  strong</li>
				  <li>Flexibility  of shape and size</li>
				  <li>Easy  to store and use</li>
				  <li>Good  pointing capability</li>
				  <li>Economical </li>
				  <li><strong>Wooden  Boxes</strong></li>
			    </ol>
				<p>            Materials  used for manufacture of wooden boxes include natural wood and industrially  manufactured, wood based sheet materials.</p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Sacks</strong></li>
			    </ol>
				            
				<p>Sacks  are traditionally made of jute fibre or similar natural materials. Most jute  sacks are provided in a plain weave. For one tonne transportation of  vegetables, materials of 250 grams per square meter or less are used.  Natural fibre sacks have in many cases been  replaced by</p>
				<p>sacks made of synthetic materials and  paper due to cost factors, appearance, mechanical properties and risk of  infestation and spreading of insects.   Sacks made of polypropylene of type plain weave are extensively used for  root vegetables. The most common fabric weight is 70-80 grams per square meter. <br />
                  <strong>Palletisation</strong><br />
            Pallets  are widely used for the transport of fruit &amp; vegetable packages, in all  developed countries. The advantages of handling packages on pallets are:</p>
				<ol>
				  <ol>
				    <li>Labour cost in handling is greatly reduced.</li>
				    <li>Transport cost may be reduced.</li>
				    <li>Goods are protected and damage reduced.</li>
				    <li>Mechanized handling can be very rapid.</li>
				    <li>Through high stacking, storage space can be  more efficiently used.</li>
				    <li>Pallets encourage the introduction of  standard package sizes.</li>
			      </ol>
			    </ol>
				<p>            In  designing export packages, their handling on pallets for shipping or for  transport and storage within the importing country, is an important factor. The  most common pallet size is 1200 mmx1100 mm. <br />
                    <strong>Ventilation  of Packages</strong> <br />
				  Reduction  of moisture loss from the product is a principal requirement of limited  permeability packaging materials. A solution to moisture loss problems from  produce appeared with the development and wide distribution of semi permeable  plastic films.  Airflow through the  ventilation holes allows hot fruit or vegetable to slowly cool and avoid the  buildup of heat produced by the commodity in respiration. Holes are also  important in cooling the fruit when the packages are placed in a cold storage,  especially with forced air-cooling. Ventilation holes improve the dispersal of  ethylene produced. <br />
  <strong>Cushioning  Materials</strong> <br />
				  The  function of cushioning materials is to fix the commodities inside the packages  and prevent them from mixing about in relation to each other and the package  itself, when there is a vibration or impact. Some cushioning materials can also  provide packages with additional stacking strength. The cushioning materials  used vary with the commodity and may be made of wrapping papers, Fibreboard  (single or double wall), Moulded paper pulp trays, Moulded foam polystyrene trays,  Moulded plastic trays, Foam plastic sheet, Plastic bubble pads, Fine shredded  wood, Plastic film liners or bags. <br />
  <strong>Controlled  and Modified Atmospheric Packaging (CAP and MAP)</strong><br />
				  The  normal composition of air is 78% Nitrogen, 21% Oxygen, 0.03% Carbon dioxide and  trees of the noble gases. Modified atmosphere packaging is the method for  extending the shelf-life of perishable and semi-perishable food products by  altering the relative proportions of atmospheric gases that surround the  produce. Although the terms controlled atmosphere (CA) and modified atmosphere  (MA) are often used interchangeably a precise difference exists between these  two terms.<br />
				  <strong>Controlled  atmosphere (CA)</strong><br />
				  This refers to a storage atmosphere that is different  from the normal atmosphere in its composition, wherein the component gases are  precisely adjusted to specific concentrations and maintained throughout the  storage and distribution of the perishable foods. Controlled atmosphere relies  on the continuous measurement of the composition of the storage atmosphere and  injection of the appropriate gases or gas mixtures into it, if and when needed.  Hence, the system requires sophisticated instruments to monitor the gas levels  and is therefore practical only for refrigerated bulk storage or shipment of  commodities in large containers.  <strong></strong><br />
				  If  the composition of atmosphere in CA system is not closely controlled or if the  storage atmosphere is accidentally modified, potential benefit can turn into  actual disaster.  The degree of  susceptibility to injury and the specific symptoms vary, not only between  cultivars, but even between growing areas for the same cultivars and between  years for a given location.  With  tomatoes, excessively low O2 or high CO2 prevents proper  ripening even after removal of the fruit to air, and CA enhances the danger of  chilling injury.<br />
  <strong>Modified  atmospheric packaging (MAP)</strong> <br />
				  Unlike  CaPs, there is no means to  control precisely the atmospheric components at a specific concentration in MAP  once a package has been hermetically sealed. Modified atmosphere conditions are  created inside the packages by the commodity itself and / or by active  modification.  Commodity – generated or  passive MA is evolved as a consequence of the commodity’s respiration. Active  modification involves creating a slight vacuum inside the package and replacing  it with a desired mixture of gases, so as to establish desired EMA quickly  composed to a passively generated EMA. </p>
				            
				<p>Another  active modification technique is the use of carbon dioxide or ethyl absorbers  (scavengers) within the package to prevent the build-up of the particular gas  within the package. This method is called active packaging. Compounds like  hydrated lime, activated charcoal, magnesium oxide are known to absorb carbon  dioxide while iron powder is known to absorb carbon dioxide.  Potassium permanganate, squakna and phenyl  methyl silicone can be used to absorb ethylene within the packages. These  scavengers can be held in small sachets within the</p>
				<p>packages or impregnated in the wrappers  or into porous materials like vermiculite. With activity respiring commodities  like fruits and vegetables, the package atmosphere should contain oxygen and  carbon dioxide at levels optimum to the particular commodity.  In general, MA containing between 2-5% Oxygen  and 3.8% carbon dioxide have been shown to extend the shelf life of a wide  variety of fruits and vegetables. <br />
            If  the shelf life of a commodity at 20-25°C is  1, by employing MAP, it will be doubled, whereas refrigeration can extend the  shelf life to 3, and refrigeration combined with MAP can increase it to 4.   Few types of films are routinely used for  MAP, the important ones are polyvinyl chloride, (PVC), polystyrene, (PS),  polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). The recent developments in  co-extrusion technology have made it possible to manufacture films with  designed transmission rates of oxygen. <br />
<strong>Vacuum  packaging</strong> <br />
            Vacuum  packaging offers an extensive barrier against corrosion, oxidation, moisture,  drying out, dirt, attraction of dust by electric charge, ultra violet rays and  mechanical damages, fungus growth or perishability etc.  This technology has commendable relevance for  tropical countries with high atmosphere humidity. <br />
            In  vacuum packaging the product to be packed is put in a vacuum bag (made of special,  hermetic fills) that is then evacuated in a vacuum chamber and then sealed  hermetically in order to provide a total barrier against air and moisture. If  some of the product cannot bear the atmosphere pressure due to vacuum inside  the package then the packages are flushed with inert gases like Nitrogen and CO2  after evacuation.<br />
<strong>Edible  packaging      </strong> <br />
An edible film or  coating is simply defined as a thin continuous layer of edible material formed  on, placed on, or between the foods or food components.  The package is an integral part of the food,  which can be eaten as a part of the whole food product.  Selection of material for use in edible  packaging is based on its properties to act as barrier to moisture and gases,  mechanical strength, physical properties, and resistance to microbial  growth.  The types of materials used for  edible packaging include lipids, proteins and polysaccharides or a combination  of any two or all of these.  Many lipid  compounds, such as animal and vegetable fats, acetoglycerides have been used in  the formulation of edible packaging for fresh produces because of their  excellent moisture barrier properties.   Lipid coatings on fresh fruits and vegetables reduce weight losses due  to dehydration during storage by 40-70 per cent.  Research and development effort is required  to develop edible films and coatings that have good packaging performance  besides being economical.  <br />
<strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
            Improved  packaging will become more essential in India as International trade  expands.  Standardized packaging of sized  and graded produce that will protect the quality during marketing can greatly  aid transactions between sellers and buyers.   Better packaging should be of immediate value in reducing waste.  Much background research on packaging of  perishable products and flowers is needed simulating the actual handling  conditions expected during marketing.<br />
