				<p align="center"><strong>IMPORTANCE  AND SCOPE OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PRESERVATION IN INDIA</strong> <br />
                    <p>Fruits  and vegetables are an important supplement to the human diet as they provide  the essential minerals, vitamins and fibre required for maintaining health. In  India, the total fruits and vegetable production is about 137 million tonnes  per year i.e. 46 MT fruits and 92 MT vegetables. The varied agro climatic  conditions available in our country make it possible for us to produce several  types of tropical, subtropical and temperate fruits and vegetables. It has been  variously estimated that 20 to 30% of the horticultural produce is lost before  consumption which accounts for&nbsp;Rs. 5000 crores because of poor harvesting,  handling, storage, transportation and marketing practices. The fruits and  vegetables are highly perishable commodities and the ambient high temperature  obtained in the tropical country like ours makes them more susceptible for  rapid development of senescence, decay and rotting. Both respiratory and  transpiratory rates are proportional to temperature, increases and so that the  produce quickly dries, wilts and spoils unless properly  preserved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Two approaches are possible for solving this problem. One is the creation /  expansion of cold storage facilities in the fruit and vegetable producing  regions themselves, as also in the major urban consumption centres, to ensure  supply of fresh fruits and vegetables throughout the year. Another approach is  to process the fruits and vegetables into various products which could be  preserved for a long time and add to the value of the product. With increasing  urbanization rise in middle class purchasing power, change in food habits and  the dyeing out of the practice of making preserves in individual homes, there  is increasing demands for factory made jams, jellies, fruit beverages,  dehydrated foods, pickles etc. in the domestic market. Moreover, there is  considerable demand for some of these products in foreign markets e.g. mangoes  both fresh and canned, fruit juices, salted cashew are good foreign exchange  earners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The production of fruit and vegetable products in India are canned, bottled  fruits and vegetables, jams, jellies, marmalades, fruit juices, fruit pulps,  squashes, crashes, cordials, fruit syrups, fruit nectars, RTS fruit beverages,  fruit juice concentrates, chutneys, pickles, mango slices in brine preserves,  candied and crystallized fruits and peels, dehydrated fruits and vegetables,  frozen fruits and vegetables, tomato products, sauces, soups etc.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In India there are 4000 processing industries are functioning. But a marginal  quantity of 1.0 to 2.0 % of the produce is processed and packaged in contrast  with developed and developing countries i.e., 70 to 80%. The total annual  consumption of processed fruits and vegetable products in the country is  rockened at only 50,000 tonnes of which defence and star hotels account for  15,000 tonnes and the remaining 35,000 tonnes to the public, i.e. a percapita  consumption of 40 gms / year. Thus we can see on enormous scope and potential  for the expansion of fruits and vegetable industries in India in the future. <br />
  <strong>Export of fruits and vegetables from India</strong><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In terms of global trade, India’s share in agricultural export is  insignificant. While India contributes 8.56% and 13.5% respectively to world’s  fruits and vegetables production, its share in global exports of these products  is less than 1.0%. Delhi, Bombay and Trivandrum are the three main parts for  air freighting of fruits and vegetables. These are mainly exported to Kuwait,  Dubai and Saudi Arbia. Grapes are exported in large quantities from Bombay  during January to March, while mango is exported during April to June. West  Asia, the Far East and West Europe are the main export markets for Indian  fruits and vegetables. Fruits juices, fruit pulp and pickles are mainly  imported by the USSR, Yemen, Arab Republic. The other markets for processed  fruits are UK, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Germany, USA, Holland and  Switzerland. Nearly half of India’s processed fruit exports are mango based  fruit juice, canned and bottled fruits. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Fresh onions and mangoes are the main commodities entering in export trade. The  other important fruits exported are melon, sweet melon, grapes, pomegranate, sapota,  custard apple, orange, papaya, pineapple. Among other vegetables the principal  items are tomato, ladies finger bitter gourd, chillies, fresh beans, cabbage,  brinjal etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
