				<p><strong>Quality  of post harvest product</strong><br />
				  Post harvest quality represents  market quality, edible quality, transport quality, table quality, nutritional  quality, internal quality and appearance quality. Quality means a combination  of characteristics, attributes and properties that gives the values to human  and enjoyments. Consumers consider good quality in relation to colour, flavour  and nutrition. Quality of the produce is the final manifestation of  inter-relation between the commodity and its environment. The genetic  characteristics and physiological status of the commodity determine the typical  post-harvest behavior and quality of the produce and these two are the major  bases for the interaction. Pre-harvest factors viz, environmental factors such  as temperature, relative humidity, water potential, light, cultural practices  and pest management techniques determined the inherent quality of the produce.  However, the ultimate quality is the final manifestation of inter relation  between the commodity and its environment. <br />
			    Several pre-harvest and post-harvest  factors affect the quality of horticultural crops. Some of these factors are  related to plant, others are related to environment or to cultural practices.</p>

				</p><p>
                  <strong>A.  Pre-harvest factors</strong><br />
                  <strong>a)  Related to plants</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Crops:  Q</strong>uality  of the fruit and vegetables are varies from crop to crop e.g. jackfruit, bael,  potato, onion, pumpkin, garlic etc. having good quality in relation to shelf  life, while apple, mango, cherry, strawberry, tomato, capsicum, okra, brussels  sprout, chinese cabbage, carrot, radish attract more to consumers due to their  attractive appearance.</li>
				  <li><strong>Cultivars:</strong> The  quality of seed or plant material is an important factor that controls the  quality of the fruit and vegetable produced. Several parameters of quality are  controlled genetically.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>• <strong>Cultural  practices</strong>: All cultural practices have direct effect on the final quality  of the produce.<br />
                    <strong>•  Planting period</strong>: Many plants are very sensitive to  environmental conditions, and thus quality will not be optimized when crop is  produced under adverse conditions. Producing summer plants during the winter or  vice-versa will not be appropriate, unless protection practices are  implemented.<br />
                    <strong>•  Planting density</strong>: It affects both the quantity and quality of  the produce. High density planting increases competition between plants,  reduces light availability, and thus may decrease quantity. Low density  planting lead to large size, better colored fruit or vegetable which may have  shorter shelf life. Larger fruits are commonly more sensitive to physiological  disorders.<br />
				  • <strong>Irrigation:</strong> Irregular watering usually reduces fruit size, increases splitting,  physiological disorders, reduces water content in the plant or plant part, etc.<br />
  <strong>•  Fertilization:</strong> Poor management of fertilizers will increase  physiological disorders due to deficiencies of some minerals or increase of  other leading to toxicity. In both cases, quality will be negatively affected.<br />
  <strong>•  Pruning:</strong> It reduces the load and increases the growth of fruit  and chemical use after harvest.<br />
  <strong>•  Thinning:</strong> This operation reduces the competition between fruits or  plants and thus promotes a good balance between the vegetative and fruit parts  and improves quality.<br />
  <strong>•  Protection:</strong> Pathogens and insects have a very negative  effect on quality. Poor management of plant protection programmes can lead to  very poor quality and reduced yield.<br />
  <strong>b)  Related to environments</strong><br />
				  Temperature is the most important  environmental factor that affects quality, very low or very high temperature  may injure sensitive crops. Adequate high intensity and quality is important  for the formation of some colour. Wind and rain may cause negative effects on  some crops.<br />
  <strong>c)  Related to chemicals</strong><br />
				  Many hormones and growth regulators  are used in agriculture and they can affect quality in different ways.<br />
  <strong>B)  During harvest factor</strong><br />
  <strong>•  Season:</strong> Quality of produce are greatly influenced by season e.g.  Winter season harvest having more shelf life as compared to other season, while  off season fruits and vegetables give more remunerative price. Harvesting  during or immediately after rains should not be carried out since it creates  most favourable conditions for multiplication of micro-organisms. Citrus fruits  become susceptible to damage if harvested during rains as their rind becomes  turgid and prone to easy bruising, sun-scald etc.<br />
  <strong>•  Time:</strong> Fruits and vegetables should always be harvested when  temperature is mild. Because, higher temperature leads to faster respiration.  Morning harvest of horticultural crop prefer for local market because they are  fully fresh and turgid and having dew drop in this time. Evening harvesting is  preferred for distant market due to higher accumulation of reserved  carbohydrates and less amount of moisture which give the better quality of the  produce to consumer. Leafy vegetables harvested in the latter part of the  morning or late in the afternoon, the petioles of these vegetables break less  easily and their leaves are more resistant to tearing, since they have lost  water through transpiration and therefore are less brittle. Cucumber is  harvested in the late morning when it to be transported under less than ideal  condition because it is less prone to injury when it contains less water.<br />
  <strong>•  Method of harvesting</strong>: Selection of suitable method for harvesting  of the produce is necessary otherwise bruises or injuries during harvesting may  later manifest as black or brown patches making them unattractive. Latex coming  out of stem in mango should not be allowed to fall on fruits as it creates a  black spot. Injury to peel may become an entry point for microorganisms,  causing rotting. Some harvesting gadgets have been developed, e.g. mango harvester  in Lucknow (CISH).<br />
  <strong>•  Stage of harvesting</strong>: Fruits and vegetables must be harvested at  right stage of maturity. A very common cause of poor product quality at harvest  and rapid deterioration thereafter is harvesting immature vegetables.  Vegetables harvested immature or over mature usually do not keep long. Fruit  vegetables harvested too early lose water fast and are more susceptible to  mechanical damage and microbial attack. An over mature vegetable is more  susceptible to decay, has passed its best eating quality, and deteriorates  fast.<br />
  <strong>•  Consumer demand</strong>: Harvesting time and harvest maturity can be  altered by the requirement of the consumer’s demand which may affect the  quality of the produce at some extent.<br />
  <strong>c)  Post-harvest factors:</strong><br />
  <strong>•  Curing:</strong> Curing is done immediately after harvesting. It  strengthens the skin. The process is induced at relatively higher temperature  and humidity, involving suberization of outer tissues followed by the  development of wound periderm which acts as an effective barrier against  infection and water loss. It is favoured by high temperature and high humidity.  Potato, sweet potato, colocasia, onion and garlic are cured prior to storage or  marketing. Potato tubers are held at 18°C for 2 days and then at 7°—10°C for  10—12 days at 90% relative humidity. Curing also reduces the moisture content  especially in onion and garlic. Drying of superficial leaves of onion bulbs  protects them from microbial infection in storage. <br />
  <strong>•  Degreening</strong>: It is the process of decomposing green pigment (Chlorophyll)  in fruits usually applying ethylene or similar metabolic inducers to fruit. It  is applicable to banana, citrus and tomato. Degreening is carried out in  special treating rooms with controlled temperature and humidity in which low  concentration of ethylene (20 ppm) is applied. <br />
  <strong>•  Pre-cooling:</strong> High temperatures are detrimental to keeping  quality of fruits and vegetables, especially when harvesting is done during hot  days. Pre-cooling is a means of removing the field heat. It slows down the rate  of respiration, minimizes susceptibility to attack of micro-organisms, and  reduces water loss. Peas and okra which deteriorate fast need prompt  pre-cooling.</p>

<ol>
				  <li><strong>Washing  and drying</strong>: Most of the fruits and vegetables are washed after  harvesting to improve their appearance, to prevent wilting and to remove  primary inoculum load of microorganism. Hence, a fungicide/bactericide should  be used in washing water. Washing, improves shelf life of bananas by delaying  their ripening. After washing, excess of water should be removed which would  otherwise encourage microbial spoilage.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>•  Sorting and grading</strong>: Fruits and vegetables require sorting and  grading for uniform packing at field level. Sorting is done on the basis of  size and colour while grading practice is performed as per the defect or on the  basis of marketable and unmarketable produce.<br />
                    <strong>•  Disinfection:</strong> Papaya, mango, melon and other fruits are  susceptible to fruit fly attack. Disinfection is done either by vapour heat  treatment (VHT) at 43°C with saturated air with water vapour for 6-8 hr by  Ethylene dibromide fumigation.<br />
                    <strong>•  Waxing:</strong> Fruits and vegetables have a natural layer on their  outer surface which is partly removed by washing. An extra discontinuous layer  of wax applied artificially with sufficient thickness and consistency to  prevent anaerobic condition within the fruits provides necessary protection  against decay organism.  Waxing also  improves the appearance and glossiness, making them more acceptable.<br />
                    <strong>•  Packing:</strong> It means more than carrying multiples of an object. Packing  not only protects the horticultural produce but also makes a favourable  impression on the buyers and May able to fetch higher income.<br />
                    <strong>•  Delivery:</strong> Moving the harvest produce from the farm to the customer  in good condition is important. All efforts upto delivery can be invalid if the  fresh fruits and vegetables reach the destination in poor condition. Care  should be taken to protect the produce and it becomes necessary when mixing  load of fruits and vegetables to prevent violating the compatibility factors.</p>
