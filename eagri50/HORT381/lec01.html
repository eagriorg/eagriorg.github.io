				<p>            Horticulture  plays a significant role in Indian Agriculture. It contributes 30% GDP from  11.73 % of its arable land area. India is the second largest producer of both  fruits and vegetables in the world (52.85 Mt and 108.20 Mt respectively).  Fruits and vegetables are of immense significance to man. In India, the fruits  have been given a place of honour on being offered to God at every festival and  have also been mentioned in our epics like Mahabharata, Ramayana and writings  of Sushrutha and Charaka. Being rich source of carbohydrates, minerals,  vitamins and dietary fibres these constitute an important part of our daily  diet. The dietary fibres have several direct and indirect advantages. Not only  this, fruits and vegetables provide a variety in taste, interest and aesthetic  appeal. Their significance in human life is being recognised increasingly in  Western societies with the objective of minimizing the occurrence of the  diseases related with an affluent life style. Their lesser recognized benefits  relate to their role in kidney functions, prevention of cancer and cardiac  disorders through contribution of ascorbic acid, b-carotene and  non-starch polysaccharides besides the biochemical constituents like phenols,  flavonoids and alkaloids.<strong></strong></p><p align="center">

				  A considerable  amount of fruits and vegetables produced in India is lost due to improper  post-harvest operations; as a result there is a considerable gap between the  gross production and net availability. Furthermore, only a small fraction of  fruits and vegetables are utilized for processing (less than 1%) and exported  (Fruits – 0.5% and Vegetables – 1.7%) compared to other countries. <br />
				  Post harvest  losses in fruits and vegetables are very high (20-40%). About 10-15% fresh  fruits and vegetables shrivel and decay, lowering their market value and  consumer acceptability. Minimizing these losses can increase their supply  without bringing additional land under cultivation. Improper handling and  storage cause physical damage due to tissue breakdown. Mechanical losses  include bruising, cracking, cuts, microbial spoilage by fungi and bacteria,  whereas physiological losses include changes in respiration, transpiration,  pigments, organic acids and flavour.<br />
  <strong>NATURE AND CAUSES OF POST-HARVEST LOSSES</strong><br />
				  Losses occur  after harvesting is known as post harvest losses. It starts first from the  field, after harvest, in grading and packing areas, in storage, during  transportation and in the wholesale and retail markets. Several losses occur  because of poor facilities, lack of know-how, poor management, market  dysfunction or simply the carelessness of farmers.<br />
  <strong>(a) Extend of post-harvest loss:</strong> It is  evident that the estimation of post-harvest loss is essential to make available  more food from the existing level of production.<br />
				  A recent joint  study conducted by the management consultancy firm, McKinsey and Co. and (The  Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), at least 50% of the production of  fruits and vegetab1es in the country is lost due to wastage and value  destruction. The wastage cost is estimated to be Rs.23, 000 crores each year.  Swaminathan Committee (1980) reported the post-harvest handling accounts for  20-30% of the losses at different stages of storage, grading, packing, transport  and finally marketing as a fresh produce or in the processed form. According to  Chadha (2009) India loses about 35-45% of the harvested fruits and vegetables  during handling, storage, transportation etc. leading to the loss of Rs. 40,000  crores per year.<br />
  <strong>(b)</strong> <strong>Important sites of post-harvest losses:</strong> Important sites where  post-harvest losses are noticed in India are —<br />
				  • Farmer’s field  (15-20%)<br />
				  • Packaging  (15_2004)<br />
				  •. Transportation  (30-40%)<br />
				  • Marketing  (30-40%)<br />

				<p><strong>(d) Causes of post-harvest losses</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Horticultural crops not only provide nutritional and healthy foods  to human beings, but also generate a considerable cash income for growers.  However, horticultural crops typically have high moisture content, tender  texture and high perishability. If not handled properly, a high-value  nutritious product can deteriorate and rot in a matter of days or hours. The  causes of post-harvest losses can be divided into different categories:<br />
                    <strong>1. Metabolic</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>All fresh horticultural crops are live organs. The natural process  of respiration involves the breakdown of food reserves and the aging of these  organs.<br />
                    <strong>2. Mechanical</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Owing to their tender texture and high moisture content, fresh  fruits and vegetables are very susceptible to mechanical injury. Poor handling,  unsuitable containers, improper packaging and transportation can easily cause  bruising, cutting, breaking, impact wounding and other forms of injury.<br />
                    <strong>3. Developmental</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>These include sprouting, rooting, seed germination, which lead to  deterioration in quality and nutritional value.<br />
                    <strong>4. Parasitic diseases</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>High post-harvest losses are caused by the invasion of fungi,  bacteria, insects and other organisms. Micro-organisms attack fresh produce  easily and spread quickly, because the produce does not have much of a natural  defense mechanism and has plenty of nutrients and moisture to support microbial  growth. <br />
                    <strong>5. Physiological deterioration</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Fruits and vegetable cells are still alive after harvest and  continue their physiological activity. Physiological disorders may occur due to  mineral deficiency, low or high temperature injury or undesirable atmospheric  conditions, such as high humidity, physiological deterioration can also occur  spontaneously by enzymatic action leading to over-ripeness and senescence, a  simple aging phenomenon.<br />
                    <strong>6. Lack of market demand</strong></p>
				            
				<p>Poor  planning pr inaccurate production and market information may lead to over  production of certain fruits or vegetables which can’t be sold in time. This  situation occurs most frequently in areas where transportation and storage  facilities are inadequate. Produce may lie</p>
				<p>rotting in production areas, if farmers are unable to transport it  to people who need it in distant locations.<br />
                  <strong>7. Consumption</strong><br />
            These losses can  be due to inadequate preservation methods at home, methods of cooking and  preparation such as peeling, consumption styles etc.<br />
<strong>8. Others</strong><br />
            — Lack of clear  concept of packing house operations.<br />
            — Lack of  awareness among the growers, contractors and even the policy makers.<br />
            — Lack of  infrastructure.<br />
            — Late  realization of its importance,<br />
            — Inadequate  technical support.<br />
            — Wide gap in  technologies available and in vogue.<br />
            — Inadequate  post-harvest quality control.<br />
            — Unorganized  marketing.<br />
            — Absence of  pre-cooling and cold storage.<br />
            — Inadequate  market facilities, market intelligence and market information service (MIS)<br />
— Poor storage facilities.<br />
<strong>(e) Impact of post-harvest losses</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>Post harvest losses of horticultural crops affect both the  nutritious status of the population and economy of the country.<br />
<strong>Nutrition</strong><br />
            Fruits and  vegetables are rich source of vitamins and minerals essential for human  nutrition. These are wasted in transit from harvest to consumer represent a  loss in the quantity of a valuable food. This is important not only in  quantitative terms, but also from the point of view of quality nutrition.<br />
<strong>Economy</strong><br />
            Careless  harvesting and rough handling of perishable bruise and scar the skin, thus  reducing quality and market price. Such damaged produce also fails to attract  the international buyers, and bring the exporting country less profit and bad  name. This ultimately results in huge economic losses to the country.<br />
            For improving the  situation, it is essential to create awareness among growers, farm workers,  manager’s traders and exporters about the extent of losses being incurred and  their economic consequences. These groups of people involved in the fruit  industry also need to learn the basic principles of fruit handling and storage.  In addition, the government needs to provide basic infra-structure like  storage, handling, grading, packing, transport and marketing facilities and  technical expertise. This could be carried out by the public and private  sectors.<br />
<strong>(f)Technologies for minimizing the losses</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>Fruits and vegetables are perishable in nature. Scientific  harvesting and handling are the practical way to reduce the losses due to  physical damage, spoilages, due to insect damages and microbial growth. Various  protocols are standardized and available for adoption to get the best result,  which will give economic benefits. Similarly, proper storage conditions, with  suitable temperature and humidity are needed to lengthen the storage life and  maintain quality once the crop has been cooled to the optimum storage tempera  Lure. Greater emphasis need to be given on the training of farmers, creation of  infrastructure for cold chain with common facilities for sorting, grading,  packing and post harvest treatments in all major markets. Some technologies for  extension of shelf life of fruits and vegetables are:<br />
<strong>1. Waxing</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>It is used as protective coating for fruits and vegetables and  help in reduction in loss in moisture and rate of respiration and ultimately results  in prolonged storage life.<br />
<strong>2. Evaporative cool storage</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>It is the best short-term storage of fruits and vegetables at farm  level. It helps the farmers to get better returns for their produce. In this  structure, horticultural crops reduce shriveling and extend their storage life.<br />
<strong>3. Pre-packaging</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>This technology controls the rate of transpiration and respiration  and hence keeps the commodity in fresh condition both at ambient and low  temperature. It can able to bring revolutionary progress in our trade practice  and also benefit the consumer and the producer because of its low cost and  ready availability.<br />
<strong>4. Cold storage</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>These structures are extensively used to store fruits and  vegetables for a long period and employ the principle of maintaining a low  temperature, which reduces the rate of respiration and thus delays ripening.<br />
<strong>5. Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP)</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>These packaging modify the atmosphere composition inside the  package by respiration. This technology is successful to extend the shelf life  of (Cavendish banana, carrots capsicum, green chilli and tomatoes by 15, 14,  13, 8 and 15 clays as against 5, 7, 8, 4 and 7 days in control respectively,  under ambient conditions. Storage of Papaya can be extended 4 weeks when stored  at 10 -12 °C under modified atmosphere (MA) conditions by wrapping them in low  density polyethylene (LDPE) bag. Using this technique, the fruit can be  transported to different markets in refrigerated sea containers with  Temperature Sea at 10-12 °C. Fruits ripen within 3-4 days after arrival when  placed at ambient temperature. While using optimum low temperature, storage  life of Cavendish banana, capsicum, green chili and tomato can be extended to  42,21,28 and 30 days in comparison to 21, 10,21 and 15 days respectively. <br />
<strong>6. Controlled Atmosphere (CA) storage</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>It is based, on the principle of maintaining an artificial  atmosphere in storage room, which has higher concentration of CO2 and lower  concentration of 02 than normal atmosphere. This reduces the rate of  respiration and thus delays aging. This method of storage is very effective  when combined with low temperature storage.<br />
<strong>7. Cold chain</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong> Following cold chain  handling system for fresh horticultural crops from (arm to consumer. It helps  in reducing wastages and retention of quality of commodities.<br />
<strong>8. Irradiation</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>It is the newer technologies that can be gainfully employed during  storage to reduce post-harvest losses and extend storage life of fruits and  vegetable. When fruits and vegetables expose to ionizing radiation (such as  gamma-rays) at optimum dosage delays ripening minimizes insect infestation,  retards microbial spoilages, control sprouting, and rotting of onion, garlic  and potato during storage. It is also used as a disinfection treatment and  controls fruit fly on citrus, mango seed weevil and papaya fruit fly.<br />
<strong>9. Edible coatings</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>These are continuous matrices prepared from edible materials such  as proteins, polysaccharides and lipids. They can be used as film wraps and  when consumed with the food, become an ingredient of the food. They not only  minimize the post harvest losses but also need for energy intensive operations  and controlled atmosphere storage. They can control migration of gases,  moisture, oil, fat, and solutes, as well as retain volatile flavouring compounds.  An edible coating improves structural integrity and mechanical handling and  carry product so that they help to maintain quality and inhibit microbial  growth causing deterioration of the product.<br />
<strong>10. Others</strong><br />
— Facilities/ services like grading, washing, cleaning, scientific  harvesting and the like, in respect of perishables at the farm level.<br />
— Cold storage facilities should be extended to tropical fruits  and vegetables.<br />
Handling protocols should be established for crops other than  mango, citrus, grapes and capsicurn to improve the shelf life and export.<br />
— The issue relating to increasing the shelf life of horticultural  products needs to he addressed.<br />
— Appropriate packaging material for export of fresh fruits,  vegetables and for modified atmosphere packaging should be developed.<br />
— Value addition needs to be viewed in a wider perspective than  mere processing to ensure better return to the producer/ farmer, besides  providing better quality product to the consumer.</p>
