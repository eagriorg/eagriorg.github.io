				<p align="justify"><strong>Noise pollution</strong><br />
				  Noise  is perhaps one of the most undesirable by products of  modern mechanized lifestyle. It may not seem  as insidious or harmful as the contamination of drinking water supplies from  hazardous chemicals, but it is a problem that affects human health and  well-being and that can also  contribute  to the  general deterioration of  environmental quality. It can affect people at home, in their community, or at  their place of work.<br />
				  Sound waves cause eardrums  to vibrate, activating middle and inner organs and sending bioelectrical  signals to the brain. The human ear can detect sounds in the frequency range of  about 20 to 20,000 Hz, but for most people hearing is best in the range of 200  to 10,000 Hz. A sound of 50 Hz frequency, for example, is perceived to be very  low-pitched, and a 15,000 - Hz sound is very high pitched. <br />
				  Simply  defined, noise is undesirable and unwanted sound. It takes energy to produce  sound, so, in a manner of speaking, noise is a  form of waste energy. It is not a substance that can accumulate in the  environment, like most other pollutants, but it can be diluted with distance  from a source. All sounds come from a sound source, whether it be a radio, a machine,  a human voice, an airplane, or a musical instrument. Not all sound is noise.  What may be considered music to one person may be nothing but noise to another.  To a extent, noise pollution is a matter of opinion. Noise is measured in terms  of Decibel units.<br />
  <strong>Sources  of noise</strong><br />
				  Based on the type of noise include<br />
				  a) Industrial Noise<br />
				  b) Transport Noise<br />
				  C) Neighbourhood Noise<br />
  <strong>Industrial  Noise</strong><br />
				  It is caused by machines  used for the technological advancement. There exist a long list of sources of noise  pollution including different machines of numerous factories, industries and mills.</p>

				  The noise is usually  measured either by i) Sound Pressure or ii) Sound Intensity.  The Sound intensity is measured in Decibel  (dB), which is tenth part of the longest unit “Bel” named after Alexander  Graham Bell.

				    •           At source  level – Can be done by  i) Designing and  fabricating silencing devices in air craft engines, automobiles industrial  machines and home appliances, ii) By segregating the noisy machines</p>
				  <p>•           During  Transmission – can be achieved by adding insulation and sound-proofing to  doors, walls,  and ceilings; covering the room walls with sound absorbers as acoustic  tiles and construction of enclosures around industrial  machinery. Zoning urban areas to maintain a separation between residential  areas and zones of excessive noise. Sound absorbents  can be used for the reduction of noise.<br />
				    a)         Acoustillite  : made up of Compressed wood pulp, wood fibers and is available in the form of  tiles<br />
				    b)         Acoustical  blanket : Prepared from mineral wool or glass fibres<br />
				    c)          Hair Felt:  Consists of wool fibres, Coarse Cotton Fibres.<br />
				    d)         Fibre Glass <br />
				    e)         Cork Carpet:  Prepared out of pieces of corks treated with linseed oil and is used for  covering floors.<br />
				    f)         Acoustic  Plaster: Mainly consists of gypsum in the form of plaster.<br />
				    •           Protecting  the  exposed person <br />
				    •           By creating  vegetation cover – Plants absorb and dissipate sound energy and thus act as  Buffer Zone. Trees should be planted along highways, schools and other places.</p>

				<p align="justify">It is clear, therefore, that a vast array of human activities result  in the release of heat to the environment. As those activities increase in  number and extent, so does the amount of heat released. In many cases, heat  added to the environment begins to cause problems for plants, humans, or other  animals. This effect is then known as <em>thermal pollution.</em><br />

The water used in such a plant has its temperature    increased by about 63oF (17oC) during the cooling    process. For this reason, such plants are usually built very close to an    abundant water supply such as a lake, a large river, or the ocean.</p></td>

				<p align="justify">When  thermal pollution drives water temperatures up, most aquatic and marine  wildlife cannot survive. Immobile organisms, such as plants and shellfish,  simply die. One inevitable result of thermal pollution  is a reduction in the amount dissolved oxygen in water. The amount of any gas  that can be dissolved in water varies inversely with the temperature. As water  is warmed, therefore, it is capable of dissolving less and less oxygen.  Organisms that need oxygen to survive will, in such cases, cant be able to  survive.</p>

                        When heated water is released    from a plant or factory, it does not readily mix with the cooler water around    it. Instead, it forms a stream-like mass known as a thermal plume that    spreads out from the outflow pipes. It is in this thermal plume that the most    severe effects of thermal pollution are likely to occur. Only over an    extended period of time does the plume gradually mix with surrounding water,    producing a mass of homogenous temperature </td>

				<p align="justify"><strong>Invasion of Destructive Organism</strong></p>
				<p align="justify">                Water  temperatures can have other, less expected effects also. As an example, trout  can swim less rapidly in water above 66oF (19oC) making  them less efficient predators. Organisms may become more subject to disease in  warmer water too. The bacterium <em>Chondrococcus columnaris</em> is harmless to  fish at temperatures of less than 50oF (10oC). Between  temperatures of 50o - 70oF (10o - 21oC),  however, it is able to invade through wounds in a fish's body and at  temperatures above 70oF (21oC) it can even attack healthy  tissue.<br />
                    <strong>Urban Heat dome</strong><br />
				  Another example of thermal pollution is the  development of urban heat islands. An urban heat island consists of a dome of  warm air over an urban area caused by the release of heat in the region. Since  more human activity occurs in an urban area than in the surrounding rural  areas, the atmosphere over the urban area becomes warmer than it is over the  rural areas.<br />
				  It is not  uncommon for urban heat islands to produce measurable climate changes. For  example, the levels of pollutants trapped in an urban heat island can reach 5  to 25 percent greater than the levels over rural areas. Fog and clouds may reach  twice the level of comparable rural areas, wind speeds may be produced by up to  30 per cent, and temperatures may be 32.9o - 35.6oF (0.5o  - 2oC) higher than in surrounding rural areas. Such differences may  cause both personal discomfort and, in some cases, actual health problems for  those living within an urban heat island.<br />

				<p align="justify"><strong>Undesirable changes in  Algal population:</strong> Excess Nutrients from the washout  water from farm lands combined with thermal pollution cause an excessive algal  growth with consequent changes. High Temperature promotes blue green algal  blooms which disrupts the aquatic food chain.<br />
                    <strong>Control of Thermal  pollution</strong><br />
				  The water  heated by thermal pollution also has a number of potential useful applications.  For example, it may be possible to establish aquatic farms where commercially  desirable fish and shellfish can be raised. The Japanese have been especially  successful in pursuing this option. Some experts have also suggested using this  water to heat buildings, to remove snow, to fill swimming pools, to use for  irrigation, to de-ice canals, and to operate industrial processes that have  modest heat requirements. Hot water is pumped into one end of the pond and cooler water is  removed from the other end. The heat gets dissipated from the pond into the  atmosphere. The main disadvantage is large amounts of water are lost due to  evaporation</p>
