				<p align="justify">Water is one of the most important  commodities which Man has exploited than any other resource for sustenance of  his life. Most of the water in this planet is stored in oceans and ice caps  which is difficult to be recovered for our diverse needs.  It can be said that no water is pure or clean  owing to the presence of some quantities of gases, minerals and life. Pure  water is considered to be that which has low dissolved and suspended solids and  obnoxious gases as well as low biological life. Water can be regarded polluted  when it changes its quality or composition either naturally or as a result of  human activities, thus becoming less suitable for drinking, domestic,  agricultural, industrial, recreational, wildlife and other uses.<br />
				  Some pollutants can be formed by way  of concentrations and transformations of naturally occurring compounds during  their domestic, agricultural or industrial use. The generation of sewage and  the waste waters containing agrochemicals, certain pesticides and surfactants,  petrochemicals, hydrocarbons, heavy metals and radionuclides are some important  examples of pollutants originated in this way. </p>
				<h5 align="justify">Sources  of Water Pollutants</h5>
				<p align="justify">To understand the effects of water  pollution and the technology applied in its control, it is useful to classify  pollutants into various groups or categories. Water pollutant can be classified  according to the nature of its origin as either a <strong>point source</strong> or a <strong>dispersed  source pollutant</strong>.<br />
				  A <strong>point source</strong> pollutant is one that  reaches the water from a pipe, channel or any other confined and localized  source.  The most common example of a  point source of pollutants is a pipe that discharges sewage into a stream or  river.  Most of these discharges are  treatment plant effluents.<br />
				  A <strong>dispersed or non point source</strong> is a  broad, unconfined area from which pollutants enter a body of water.  Surface runoff from agricultural areas  carries silt, fertilizers, pesticides, and animal wastes into streams, but not  at only one particular point.  These  materials can enter the water all along a stream as it flows through the  area.  Acidic runoff from mining areas is  a dispersed pollutant.  Storm water  drainage systems in towns and cities are also considered to be dispersed  sources of many pollutants, because, even though the pollutants are often  conveyed into streams or lakes in drainage pipes or storm sewers, there are  usually many of these discharges scattered over a large area. <br />
				  Point  source pollutants are easier to deal with, while pollutants from dispersed  sources are much more difficult to control.   Many people think that sewage is the primary culprit in water pollution  problems, but dispersed sources cause a significant fraction of the water  pollution. The most effective way to control the dispersed sources is to set  appropriate restrictions on land use. </p>
				<h5 align="justify">Oxygen –  Demanding Wastes</h5>
				<p align="justify">                One of the most important water  quality parameters is the dissolved oxygen (DO) present.  Oxygen – demanding wastes are substances that  oxidize in the receiving body of water, reducing the amount of DO  available.  As DO drops, fish and other  aquatic life are threatened and, in the extreme case, killed.  In addition, as dissolved oxygen levels fall,  undesirable odors, tastes, and colors reduce the acceptability of the water as  a domestic supply and reduce its attractiveness for recreational uses.  Oxygen-demanding wastes are usually  biodegradable organic substances contained in municipal wastewaters or in  effluents from certain industries, such as food processing and paper  production.  In addition, the oxidation  of certain inorganic compounds may also contribute to the oxygen demand.  Even naturally occurring organic matter, such  as leaves and animal droppings, that find their way into surface water add to  the DO depletion. Minimum amounts required  for a healthy fish population may be as high as 5-8 mg/L for active species,  such as trout, or as low as 3 mg/L for less desirable species, such as carp.<br />
				  There  are several measures of oxygen demand commonly used.  The chemical oxygen demand, or COD, is the  amount of oxygen needed to chemically oxidize the wastes, while the biochemical  oxygen demand, or BOD, is the amount of oxygen required by microorganisms to  biologically degrade the wastes.  BOD has  traditionally been the most important measure of the strength of organic  pollution, and the amount of BOD reduction in a wastewater treatment plant is a  key indicator of process performance.<br />
  <strong>Pathogens</strong><br />
				  It  has long been known that contaminated water is responsible for the spread of  many contagious diseases.  Pathogens are  disease-producing organisms that grow and multiply within the host.  Examples of pathogens associated with water  include bacteria responsible for cholera, bacillary dysentery, typhoid, and  paratyphoid fever; viruses responsible for infectious hepatitis and  poliomyelitis; protozoa, which cause amoebic dysentery and giardiasis; and  helminthes, or parasitic worms, which cause diseases such as schistosomiasis  and dracontiasis (guinea worm).  The  intestinal discharges of an infected individual, a carrier, may contain  billions of these pathogens, which, if allowed to enter the water supply, can  cause epidemics of immense proportions.   Carriers may not even necessarily exhibit symptoms of their disease,  which makes it even more important to carefully protect all water supplies from  any human waste contamination.<br />
  <strong>Nutrients</strong><br />
				  Nutrients  are chemicals, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon, sulfur, calcium,  potassium, iron, manganese, boron, and cobalt, that are essential to the growth  of living things.  In terms of water  quality, nutrients can be considered as pollutant when their concentrations are  sufficient to allow excessive growth of aquatic plants, particularly  algae.  When nutrients stimulate the  growth of algae, the attractiveness of the body of water for recreational uses,  as a drinking water supply, and as a viable habitat for other living things can  be adversely affected. Nutrient enrichment  can lead to blooms of algae which eventually die and decompose.  Their decomposition removes oxygen from the  water, potentially leading to levels of DO that are insufficient to sustain  normal life forms.  </p>
				<p align="justify">                Major  sources of both nitrogen and phosphorus include municipal wastewater  discharges, runoff from animal feedlots, and chemical fertilizers.  In addition, certain bacteria and blue-green  algae can obtain nitrogen directly from the atmosphere.  These life forms are usually abundant in  lakes that have high rates of biological productivity, making the control of  nitrogen in such lakes extremely difficult.   Certain forms of acid rain can also contribute nitrogen to lakes.  While there are several special sources of  nitrogen, the only unusual source of phosphorus is from detergents.  When phosphorus is the limiting nutrient in a  lake that is experiencing an algal problem, it is especially important to limit  the nearby use of phosphate in detergents.<br />
				  Not  only is nitrogen capable of contributing to eutrophication problems, but when  found in drinking water a particular form of it can pose a serious public  health threat.  Nitrogen in water is  commonly found in the form of nitrate (NO3), which is itself not  particularly dangerous.  However, certain  bacteria commonly found in the intestinal tract of infants can convert nitrates  to highly toxic nitrites (NO2).   Nitrites have a greater affinity for hemoglobin in the bloodstream than  does oxygen, and when they replace that needed oxygen a condition known as  methemoglobinemia results.  The resulting  oxygen starvation causes a bluish discoloration of the infant; hence, it is  commonly referred to as the “blue baby” syndrome.  In extreme cases the victim may die from  suffocation.</p>
				<h5 align="justify">Salts</h5>
				<p align="justify">                Water  naturally accumulates a variety of dissolved solids, or salts, as it passes  through soils and rocks on its way to the sea.   These salts typically include such cations as sodium, calcium,  magnesium, and potassium, and anions such as chloride, sulfate, and bicarbonate.  Commonly used measure of salinity is the  concentration of total dissolved solids (TDS).   As a rough approximation, fresh water can be considered to be water with  less than 1500 mg/L TDS; brackish waters may have TDS values up to 5000 mg/L;  and, saline waters are those with concentrations above 5000 mg/L.  Seawater contains 30 000 – 34 000 mg/L TDS.<br />
				  The  concentration of dissolved solids is an important indicator of the usefulness  of water for various applications.   Drinking water, for example, has a recommended maximum contaminant level  for TDS of 500 mg/L.  Livestock can  tolerate higher concentrations.  Of  greater importance, however, is the salt tolerance of crops.  As the concentration of salts in irrigation  water increases above 500mg/L, the need for careful water management to  maintain crop yields becomes increasingly important.  With sufficient drainage to keep salts from  accumulating in the soil, up to 1500 mg/L TDS can be tolerated by most crops  with little loss of yield but at concentrations above 2100 mg/L, water is  generally unsuitable for irrigation except for the most salt tolerant of crops.<br />
  <strong>Thermal Pollution</strong><br />
				  A large steam-electric power plant requires an  enormous amount of cooling water.  A  typical nuclear plant, for example, warms about 40m3/s of cooling  water by 100C as it passes through the plant’s condenser.  If that heat is released into a local river  or lake, the resulting rise in temperature can dramatically affect life in the  vicinity of the thermal plume.<br />
				  As  water temperature increases, two factors combine to make it more difficult for  aquatic life to get sufficient oxygen to  meet its needs.  The first results from  the fact that metabolic rates tend to increase with temperature, generally by  about a factor of 2 for each 100C rise in temperature.  This causes an increase in the amount of  oxygen required by organisms.  At the  same time, the available supplies of dissolved oxygen are reduced both because  waste assimilation is quicker, drawing down DO at a faster rate, and because  the amount of DO that the water can hold decreases with temperature.  Thus, as temperatures increases, the demand  for oxygen goes up while the amount of DO available goes down.<br />
  <strong>Heavy Metals</strong><br />
				  In  chemical terms heavy metal refer to metals with specific gravity greater than  about 4 or 5, but more often, the term is simply used to denote metals that are  toxic.  The list of toxic metals includes  aluminum, arsenic, beryllium, bismuth, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron,  lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, selenium, strontium, thallium, tin, titanium,  and zinc.  Some of these metals, such as  chromium and iron, are essential nutrients in our diets, but in higher doses  are extremely toxic.<br />
				  The  most important route for the elimination of metals is via the kidneys.  In fact, kidney can be considered to be  complex filters whose primary purpose is to eliminate toxic substances from the  body.  The kidneys contain millions of  excretory units called nephrons, and chemicals that are toxic to the kidneys  are called nephrotoxins.  Cadmium, lead,  and mercury are examples of nephrotoxic metals.   Metals have a range of adverse impacts on the body, including nervous  system and kidney damage, creation of mutations, and induction of tumors.<br />
  <strong>Pesticides</strong><br />
				  The  term pesticide is used to cover a range of chemicals that kill organisms that  humans consider undesirable and includes the more specific categories of  insecticides, herbicides, rodenticides, and fungicides.  There are three main groups of synthetic  organic insecticides: <em>organochlorines </em>(also  known as <em>chlorinated hydrocarbons),  organophosphates, </em>and <em>carbamates</em>.  In addition, a number of herbicides,  including the chlorophenoxy compounds 2,4,5-T (which contains the impurity  dioxin, which is one of the most potent toxins known) and 2,4-D are common  water pollutants.<br />
				  The  most well-known organ chlorine pesticide is DDT  (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) which has been widely used to control insects that  carry diseases such as malaria, typhus, and plague.  By contributing to the control of these diseases,  DDT is credited with saving literally millions of lives worldwide.  In spite of its more recent reputation as a  dangerous pesticide, in terms of human toxicity DDT is considered to be  relatively safe.  It was its impact on  food chains, rather than human toxicity that led to its ban.  Organo chlorine pesticides, such as DDT, have  two properties that cause them to be particularly disruptive to food  chains.  They are very <em>persistent,</em> which means they last a long  time in the environment before being broken down into other substances, and  they are quite <em>soluble </em>in lipids,  which means they easily accumulate in fatty tissue.  This phenomenon in which the concentration of  a chemical increases at higher levels in the food chain is known as <em>biomagnification </em>or <em>bioconcentration. </em><br />
				  Other widely used organochlorines included  methoxychlor, chlordane, heptachlor, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, endosulfan, and  kepone.  Animal studies have shown  dieldrin, heptachlor, and chlordane produce liver cancers, and aldrin, dieldrin,  and endrin have been shown to cause birth defects in mice and hamsters.  Given the ecosystem disruption, the toxicity,  and the biological resistance to these pesticides that many insect species have  developed, organochlorines have largely been replaced with organophosphates and  carbamates.<br />
				  The  organophosphates, such as parathion, malathion, diazinon, TEPP (tetraethyl  pyrophosphate), and dimethoate, are effective against a wide range of insects  and they are not persistent.  However,  they are much more toxic than the organochlorines that they have replaced.  They are rapidly absorbed through the skin,  lungs, and gastrointestinal tract and hence, unless proper precautions are  taken, they are very hazardous to those who use them.  Humans exposed to excessive amounts have  shown a range of symptoms including tremor, confusion, slurred speech, muscle  twitching, and convulsions. Popular carbamate pesticides include propoxur,  carbaryl, and aldicarb.  Acute human  exposure to carbamates has led to a range of symptoms, such as nausea,  vomiting, blurred vision, and in extreme cases, convulsions.<br />
  <strong>Volatile Organic Compounds</strong><br />
				  Volatile  Organic Compounds (VOCs) are among the most commonly found contaminants in  groundwater.  They are often used as  solvents in industrial processes and a number of them are known or suspected  carcinogens or mutagens.  Their  volatility means they are not often found in concentrations above a few  micrograms per liter in surface waters, but in groundwater their concentrations  can be hundreds or thousands of times higher.   Their volatility also suggests the most common method of treatment,  which is to aerate the water to encourage them to vaporize. <em>Vinyl chloride </em>(chloroethylene), <em>Tetrachloroethylene </em>(TCE)<em>, Trichloroethylene 1,2-Dichloroethane, Carbon  tetrachloride </em>are some of important VOCs found in groundwater.<br />
  <strong>Effects of Water Pollution</strong><br />
  <strong>1. Physicochemical effects</strong><br />
				  A  large number of pollutants can impart colour, tastes and odours to the  receiving waters, thus making them unaesthetic and even unfit for domestic  consumption. The changes in oxygen, temperature and pH affect the chemistry of  waters often triggers chemical reactions resulting in the formation of unwanted  products. The addition of organic matter results in depletion of oxygen with  concomitant increase in carbon dioxide owing to bacterial degradation.<br />
  <strong>2. Biological effects</strong><br />
				  The addition of pollutants leads to  the shift in flora and fauna due to homeostatic factors operating in the  aquatic systems. Most of the freshwater algae are highly sensitive to  pollutants and their elimination modifies the prey-predatory relationships by  breaking down the food chains. This results in the change of the whole plant  and animal communities. The diversity of organism decrease due to the presence  of only a few tolerant forms in the polluted conditions.<br />
				  The first response to the added  nutrients is increased algal growth which is often composed of obnoxious bloom  forming blue-green or green chlorophycean algal forms. Many of the blue-greens  are not consumed by predators and some even produce toxic secretions causing  allelopathic effects (e.g<em>., Microcystis</em> spp.)<br />
				  <strong>3. Toxic  effects</strong><br />
				  These are caused by pollutants such as  heavy metals, biocides, cyanide and other organic and inorganic compounds which  are detrimental to the other organisms. These substances usually have very low  permissible limits in water and their presence beyond limits can render the  water unfit for aquatic biota and even for human use<br />
				  These chemicals are toxic to aquatic  organisms, and many of them especially those non-biodegradable, accumulate in  the body of the organisms and biomagnify along the tropic levels causing long  term effects.<br />
  <strong>4. Pathogenic effects</strong><br />
				  Besides the chemical substances, a few  wastes like sewage, also contain several pathogenic and nonpathogenic  microorganism and viruses. The <em>Clostridium perfringens</em> and <em>Streptococcus faecalis</em> cause various  types of food poisoning. Apart from this, many water borne diseases like  cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid, colitis, and infective hepatitis (jaundice) are  spread by consumption of sewage contaminated waters.<br />
  <strong>5. Eutrophication </strong><br />
				  One  of the most severe and commonest water pollution problems is due to enrichment  of waters by plant nutrients that increases the biological growth and renders  the water bodies unfit for diverse uses. The process of increase in the  nutrients of waters and resultant spurt in algal productivity is called <strong><em>eutrophication</em>.</strong><br />
				  The term eutrophication has been  derived from a Greek word <strong>eutrophos</strong> meaning corpulent or rich. The first use of this term in ecology was made in  connection with the remnants of the extinct lakes rather than with live lakes.  Weber (1907), while studying the evolution of North German peat bogs, found  that the upper layers have more nutrients in comparison to the lower ones as  the original lakes received much higher nutrient supply prior to their  transformation into bogs. He used the terms <strong>eutrophic</strong> (rich in nutrients) and <strong>oligotrophic</strong> (poor in nutrients) to distinguish between these two  layers. The use of these terms in limnology was made for the first time by  Naumann (1919), in order to denote nutrient poor (oligotrophic) and nutrient  rich (eutrophic) conditions in relation to the development of different algal  associations.</p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>The Process Of Eutrophication</strong><br />
				  The  eutrophication is basically a natural phenomenon which gets accelerated by  increased nutrient supply through human activities. The process of  eutrophication starts as soon as the lakes are formed because of the entry of  nutrients by natural means, but the rate of eutrophication remains quite low  under natural conditions. The process of eutrophication can be discussed under  two heads of natural and accelerated processes, though its basic features  remain essentially the same.<br />
  <strong>1. Natural eutrophication</strong><br />
				  The  lakes generally originate as oligotrophic and have only limited quantities of  nutrients depending upon the mode of their formation and composition of  original sediments. These nutrients are insufficient to produce any significant  algal growth. At this stage the lakes have only autochthonous nutrients  (indigenous nutrients cycling therein), which usually recycle completely in the  absence of any outside supply. All the biological production is completely  decomposed after death. As the <strong>allochthonous </strong>nutrients (nutrients from outside) start entering the lake, the process of  eutrophication sets in. The principal natural sources of nutrients are the  natural run-off, fall of leaves and twigs from the surrounding vegetation,  periodical submergence of the nearby terrestrial vegetation, rain fall and bird  droppings etc.<br />
				  The  build-up of nutrients through this slow mode of entry gradually starts  increasing the growth of algae. When the algae die and decompose, the locked  nutrients are again made available to the fresh algal growth. The tropical or  hot climate usually supports a higher rate of eutrophication as it favours  higher nutrients utilization and algal growth in comparison to cold and  temperate climates.<br />
  <strong>2. Accelerated Eutrophication</strong><br />
				  The  process of eutrophication is greatly augmented by the increased supply of  nutrients through various human activities such as discharge of domestic  sewage, industrial wasters, agricultural and urban run-off. Increased levels of  air pollution also make the water bodies rich in nutrients through their  transport with rains or by dry fallout. This increased supply of nutrients  triggers the algal growth at much faster rate, thus increasing the speed of  eutrophication, which otherwise would have been a slow natural phenomenon. The  process of eutrophication is, therefore, sometimes referred to as <strong><em>ageing of lakes</em></strong><em>. </em><strong> </strong><br />
  <strong>Sources of nutrients</strong><br />
				  Water  bodies may be enriched with nutrients through both natural and man made  sources, nevertheless, their quantities may greatly differ from source to source.  The man-made sources are much more significant contributors of nutrients than  the natural sources.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong> Rainfall and  Atmospheric Deposition</strong></li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">                Rain  water may contain varying amounts of nutrients depending upon the local  atmospheric pollution. Experimental data indicate that rain water, on an  average, contains 0.16 to 1.06 mg L-1 of nitrate nitrogen, 0.04 to  1.7 mg L-1 of ammonia nitrogen and from traces to 0.1 mg L-1  of phosphorus. </p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong>Urban and Rural Run-Off</strong></li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">                The  run-off water adds significant quantities of nutrients and organic matter from  the soil and other surfaces. Urban run-off contains storm water drainage with  organic and inorganic debris from various surfaces both paved and grassed, and  fertilizers from gardens and lawns. Rural run-off originates from sparsely  populated areas with little or no land devoted to agriculture. </p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong>Agricultural Run-off</strong></li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">                The  enrichment material in the agricultural run-off is derived from fertilizer  applied to the crops, and from farm animal houses. Nitrogen used as fertilizers  may get converted into nitric acid in soil,  solubilizing calcium, potassium and other ions  which become highly liable to leaching.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong>Domestic Sewage</strong></li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">                Sewage  is the commonest source of nutrients and organic matter, and undoubtedly the  greatest contributor to the eutrophication of lakes. Large quantities of  nitrogen and phosphorus are excreted by humans and animals which get their way  into sewage. According to an estimate, an average of 2 g of PO4-P  per day is released through urine and faces by an average person, Phosphatic  detergents in sewage are also important contributor of phosphorus.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong>Industrial Wastes</strong></li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">                The  nutrients in industrial effluents are variable in quality and quantity  depending upon the processes and type of industry. The wastes from certain  industries, particularly fertilizers, chemicals and food, are rich in nitrogen  and phosphorus.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong>Water Fowl</strong></li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">                The  droppings of water fowl is a source of nutrients which may cause the local  problems of eutrophication, especially in small bodies of water. The overall  effect of this source on the whole water body may be negligible. It is  estimated that wild ducks contribute 5.8 kg of nitrogen/acre/year and 2.55 kg  of total phosphorus/acre/year to the lakes.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong>Ground Water</strong> </li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">                Ground  water in some cases may act as a source of nitrogen to the surface waters. It  is, however, not a recognized source at all places, but may be an important  factor in certain areas. It has been estimated that about 42% of nitrogen in  Wisconsin surface waters comes from ground water.<br />
                    <strong>Effects Of Eutrophication</strong><br />
                    <strong>a. Physico – chemical  Effects </strong><br />
				  Pollution  can be considered as a departure from the balance between photosynthesis and  respiration. At equilibrium (P = R), the chemical and biological composition of  water remains unchanged, a stage that mostly occurs only in non-polluted waters  with no external supply of nutrients. An eutrophic water body is one where  photosynthesis exceeds the respiration activity. It is characterized by a  progressive accumulation of algae which ultimately leads to an organic  overloading. When respiration exceeds photosynthesis, dissolved oxygen gets  rapidly exhausted forcing reduction of several oxidized chemical species like  NO3, SO4-2 and CO2 into N2,  NH4+, H2S and CH4 which  are harmful to several aquatic species and produce typical odours.<br />
  <strong>b. Biological Effects</strong><br />
				  Many  desirable species including fish are replaced by undesirable ones. There is an  algal succession resulting in the dominance of blue green algae which have very  low nutrition value in the food chains, and many of them produce the blooms.  Some important bloom forming blue green algal genera include <em>Microcystis,  Anabaena, Oscillatoria and Aphanizomenon.</em> Filamentous green algae, such as <em>Spirogyra,  Cladophora, and Zygnema</em> form a dense floating mat or “blanket” on the  surface when the density of the bloom becomes sufficient to reduce the  intensity of solar light below the surface. <br />
				  Nutrient  enrichment has very limited direct effect on zooplankton communities, but  indirect effect may be significant. The diversity of zooplankton remains high  if the diversity of phytoplankton is also high as often found in case of  oligotrophic or moderately enriched waters. As the changes occur in the water  due to eutrophication, the characteristics of sediments also change. There is  an accumulation of organic matter which affect the benthic communities.<br />
				  Eutrophication  of moderate level may be beneficial to fish production as it increases the food  supply for fish in the form of algae. With the increase in the level of  eutrophication, dominance of algal groups is taken over by blue greens making  the edible or game fish to be replaced by hardy species of very little economic  value. The algal blooms cause discolouration of water and attract water fowl  which further contribute to the pollution of water. The overall effects make  the waters much less suitable for recreation, fish production and domestic  uses. The cost of water treatment is also escalated.<br />
  <strong>Control of Eutrophication </strong><br />
				  The first step in  any control programme should be a regular monitoring of certain parameters <em>(e.g., </em>nutrients, algal species,  productivity, <em>etc.) </em>in the  water body to evaluate the level of eutrophication and its trends. The next  step would be to prepare an inventory of inflows, especially to know the  sourcewise contribution of nutrients. The reduction of nutrient supply to a  water body can be brought about by a number of methods involving either  prevention of the entry of nutrients or by some <em>in situ </em>water treatment  procedures to curtail the nutrient availability to algae.<br />
  <strong>a. Diversion of Nutrients from a Lake </strong><br />
				  The diversion of  nutrient-bearing flows away from lakes can keep them free from nutrients. This  can be achieved when the nutrients enter the lake mainly through point sources  such as domestic sewage and industrial wastes. The wastes can be diverted directly  to somewhere else like in downstream, estuary or oceans which have  comparatively greater self-purification capacities than stagnant waters.<br />
  <strong>b. Removal of  Nutrients from Waste Waters </strong><br />
				  Any degree of treatment  to remove the nutrients and organic matter can be given to wastes depending  upon the process selected. Secondary treatment usually removes only organic  matter-and is not effective in controlling eutrophication. Though tertiary  treatment methods are fairly well known to remove practically all nutrients,  interest often lies in the removal of only phosphorus for control of  eutrophication.<br />
  <strong>c.</strong> <strong>Flushing  Out of Polluted Water by Nutrient Poor Water </strong><br />
				  The technique is  useful for relatively small and highly polluted waters where the existing water  can be removed to a convenient place and a supply of high quality water is  readily available. Two approaches are usually followed for this; in one, the  incoming water shall displace an equivalent amount of polluted water and in the  other, a quantity of polluted water is removed first to be replaced later by  the water of low nutrient content.<br />
  <strong>d. Removal of Locked-up Nutrients </strong><br />
				  Nutrients in aquatic  ecosystems are locked-up in the tissues of fish, other animals, vegetation  (macrophytes) and, of course, in the algae besides being in the water and  sediments. Periodical removal of macrophytes and fish, especially when the  water level is low, would help in removing a quantity of nutrients from water.  The further entry of the nutrients should be checked, since their build up in wa<u>t</u>er  can start again after recovery.<br />
  <strong>e. Dredging of Sediments </strong><br />
				  A large proportion of nutrients can also be  removed by dredging the sediments out of the lake. Dred<u>gi</u>ng may be  feasible where simultaneous deepening of the lake is also desired.<br />
  <strong>f. Covering of Sediments </strong><br />
				  The nutrients and  organic matter present in upper sediments of a lake, under proper conditions,  can be re solubilized by microbial action or by change in chemical  conditions.  The retardation of release  of these nutrients shall check the internal fertilization. This can be  performed by covering the sediments with some suitable material such as rubber or polythene sheets or some  other inert material like clay or fly–ash.<br />
  <strong>g. Oxygenation and Mixing</strong> <br />
				  Mixing of water column  de stratifies the lakes and eliminates the anaerobic reducing conditions in  hypolimnetic waters, promoting the development of uniform profiles of dissolved  oxygen, temperature, phosphorus and other such parameter. The release of nutrients from the sediments is about10 times more in  anaerobic conditions than that in aerobic conditions. Oxygenation by ­way of  mixing eliminates anaerobic conditions and lowers the nutrient release from sediments. A proper mixing and aeration in water  column can be carried out by using compressed air pump. <br />
  <strong>h. Nutrient Inactivation </strong><br />
				  The technique involves eliminating the  nutrients from their natural cycles in the water  bodies by various chemical means, in order to make them unavailable for the growth of algae.  Phosphorus is the most important nutrient controlled in this manner. The use of  calcium hydroxide or aluminium sulphate coprecipitates  phosphorus with them which settles at the bottom. <br />
  <strong>i. Zoning and Watershed Management </strong><br />
				  Many of the water  pollution problems arise due to lack of proper management of watershed areas  leading to excessive erosion and entrainment of nutrients and organic matter in  run-off. The land use pattern in the watershed or catchment’s area will  determine the nature of drainage. A check on deforestation and erosion will  help reducing the nutrient load of the  water resources.  Selection of suitable  sites for industries, agriculture, urban development and so on will also help  in controlling the water quality.<u> </u><br />
  <strong>6.Biological Magnification</strong><br />
				  When  a living organism cannot metabolize or excrete ingested substance that  substance gradually accumulates in the organisms. This phenomenon, called  biological accumulation (or bioaccumulation), refers to the process by which a  substance first enters in to a food chain. The extent to which bioaccumulation  will occur depends on an organism’s metabolism and on the solubility of the  substance first enters a food chain. If the substance is soluble in fat, it  will typically accumulate in the fatty tissues of the organism. Bioaccumulation  is of particular concern when the substance being concentrated is a toxic  environmental pollutant and the organism is of a relatively low trophic level  in a food chain.<br />
				  When  many contaminated organisms are consumed by second organism that can neither  metabolize nor excrete the substance, the concentration of the substance will  build to even higher levels in the second organism. This effect is magnified at  each successive trophic level, and the process is called <strong>biological magnification</strong> (or biomagnification). In other words,  biomagnification is the increasing concentration of a substance as it moves  from one level of a food chain to the next (for example, from plankton to fish  to birds or to humans).  Biomagnification  is of particular importance when chemicals are concentrated to harmful levels  in organisms higher up in the food chain. Even very low concentrations of  environmental pollutants can eventually find their way into organisms in high  enough doses to cause serious problems.<br />
				  Biomagnification  occurs only when the pollutants are environmentally persistent (last a long  time before breaking down into simpler compounds), mobile, and soluble in  fats.  <br />
				  Biomagnification can’t occur </p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>if they are not persistent, they will not last long enough in the  environment to be concentrated in the food chain.  (persistent substances are generally not  biodegradable).  </li>
				    <li>If they are not mobile, that is, not   easily transported or moved from place to place in the environment, they  are not likely to be consumed by many organisms.  </li>
				    <li>if they are soluble in water rather than fatty tissue, they are much  more likely to be excreted by the organism before building up to dangerous  levels. </li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Impact of DDT   </strong><br />
				  The  incidence of mercury poisoning in people who consumed contaminated fish in the  Minamata Bay region of Japan in 1950s is just one example of the detrimental  effects of biomagnification.  Another  classic example involves DDT,an  abbreviation for the organic chemical dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane.  It is a type of chemical known as chlorinated  hydrocarbon,and it takes a long time  to break down in the environment.  With a  “half-life” of 15 years, if 10 kg of DDT were released into the environment in  the year 2000, 5 kg would still persist in the year 2015, about 2.5 kg would  remain in 2030, and even after 100 years had elapsed, in the year 2100, more  than 100 g of the substance would still be detected in the environment.  Of course, long before that time span  elapsed, some of the DDT could be inadvertently consumed by living organisms as  they forage for food, and thereby enter a food chain. <br />
				  DDT  is toxic to insects, but not very toxic to humans.  It was much used in World War II to protect  U.S. troops from tropical mosquito – borne malaria as well as to prevent the  spread of lice and lice-borne disease among civilian populations in  Europe.  After the war, DDT was used to  protect food crops from insects as well as to protect people from insect-borne  disease.  As one of the first of the  modern pesticides, it was overused, and by the 1960s, the problems related to  biomagnificantion of DDT became very apparent. <br />
				  Many  other substances in addition to mercury and DDT exhibit bioaccumulation and  biomagnification in an ecosystem.  These  include copper, cadmium, lead, and other heavy metals, pesticides other than  DDT, and cyanide, selenium and PCBs. <strong></strong><br />
  <strong>Control of Water pollution</strong><br />
				  Raw or untreated sewage comprises  about 99.9 per cent water and only about 0.1 per cent impurities.  In contrast to this, sea water is only about  96.5 per cent pure water; it contains about 35,000 mg/L, or 3.5 per cent  dissolved impurities.  Although sea water  contains more impurities than does sanitary sewage, we do not ordinarily  consider seawater to be polluted.  The  important distinction is not the total concentration, but the type of  impurities.  The impurities in seawater  are mostly inorganic salts, but sewage contains biodegradable organic material,  and it is very likely to contain pathogenic microorganisms as well.<br />
				  Actually,  sewage  contain so many different  substances, both suspended and dissolved, that it is impractical to attempt to  identify each specific substance or microorganisms.  The total amount of organic materials is  related to the strength of the sewage.   This is measured by the biochemical oxygen demand, or BOD.  Another important measure or parameter  related to the strength of the sewage is the total amount of suspended solids,  or TSS.  On the average, untreated  domestic sanitary sewage has a BOD of about 200 mg/L and a TSS of about 240  mg/L.   Industrial wastewater may have  BOD and TSS values much higher than those for sanitary sewage; its composition  is source dependent. <br />
				  Another  group of impurities that is typically of major significance in waste water is  the plant nutrients.  Specifically, these  are compounds of nitrogen and phosphorous.   On the average, raw sanitary sewage contains about 35 mg/ L of N and 10  mg / L of  P.  Finally, the amount of pathogens in the waste  water is expected to be proportional to the concentration of fecal coli form  bacteria.  The coli form concentration in  raw sanitary sewage is roughly 1 billion per liter.  Coli form concentration, as well as BOD, TSS,  and concentrations of N and P, are parameters of water quality.<br />
				  Before  discharging wastewater back into the environment and the natural hydrologic  cycle, it is necessary to provide some degree of treatment in order to protect  public health and environmental quality.   The basic purposes of sewage treatment are to destroy pathogenic  microorganisms and to remove most suspended and dissolved biodegradable organic  materials.  Sometimes it is also  necessary to remove the plant nutrients – nitrogen and phosphorous.  Disinfection, usually with chlorine, serves  to destroy most pathogens and helps to prevent the transmission of communicable  disease.  The removal of organics (BOD)  and nutrients helps to protect the quality of aquatic eco-systems. <br />
  <strong>Waste water treatment </strong><br />
				  These  treatment methods are grouped into three general categories:  <strong>primary</strong> treatment, <strong>secondary or biological</strong> treatment and <strong>tertiary or advanced</strong> treatment. <br />
  <strong>Primary Treatment                                                                 </strong><br />
				  Untreated  or raw wastewater usually flows by gravity from an interceptor or trunk sewer  into the head works of a treatment facility; sometimes wastewater may be pumped  to the treatment plant in a force.  The  head works of a treatment plant include a flow measurement device and  mechanical systems that provide preliminary treatment.  Preliminary treatment systems typically  include screens, comminutors, and grit chambers.<br />
				  The  first treatment process for raw wastewater is coarse screening.  Bar screens (or racks), as they are called,  are made of long, narrow metal bars spaced about 25 mm (1 in.) apart.  They retain floating debris, such as wood  rags, or other bulky objects, that could clog pipes or damage mechanical  equipment in the rest of the plant. <br />
				  In  some treatment plants, a mechanical cutting or shredding device, called a  comminutor, is installed just after the coarse screens.   The comminutor  shreds and chops solids or rags that passed  through the bar screen.  The shredded  material is removed from the waste water by sedimentation or flotation later in  the treatment plant. <br />
  <strong>Grit removal</strong><br />
				  A  portion of the suspended solids in raw sewage consists of gritty material, such  as sand, coffee grounds, eggshells, and other relatively inert material.  In cities with combined sewer systems, sand  and silt may be carried in the sewage.   Suspended grit can cause excessive wear and tear on pumps and other  equipment in the plant.  Most of it is  non biodegradable and will accumulate in treatment tanks.  For these reasons, a grit removal process is  usually used after screening and / or comminuting. <br />
  <strong>Primary sedimentation  (Settling)</strong><br />
				  After  preliminary treatment by screening, comminuting, and grit removal, the  wastewater still contains suspended organic solids that can be removed by plain  sedimentation. Settling tanks that receive sewage after grit removal are called  primary clarifiers. The combination of preliminary screening and gravity  settling is called primary treatment.   Chemicals may sometimes be added to the primary clarifiers to promote  the removal of very small (or colloidal) particles.  Primary treatment usually can remove up to 60  per cent of the suspended solids and about 35 per cent of the BOD from  wastewater, but this relatively low level of treatment is no longer adequate.  In almost all cases, primary treatment must be followed by secondary treatment  processes; tertiary treatment may also be required to protect sensitive bodies  of water that receive the treated effluent. <br />
  <strong>Secondary (Biological)  Treatment </strong><br />
				  Primary  treatment processes remove only those pollutants that will either float or  settle out by gravity, but about half of the raw pollutant load still remains  in the primary effluent.  The purpose of  secondary treatment is to remove the suspended solids that did not settle out  in the primary tanks and the dissolved BOD that is  unaffected by physical treatment.  Secondary treatment is generally considered  to meet 85 per cent BOD and TSS removal efficiency and represents the minimum  degree of treatment required in most cases.  <br />
				  Biological  treatment of sewage involves the use of microorganisms. The microbes, including  bacteria and protozoa, consume the organic pollutants as food.  They metabolize the biodegradable organics,  converting them into carbon dioxide, water and energy for their growth and  reproduction. A biological sewage treatment system must provide the  microorganisms with a comfortable home.   In effect, the treatment plant allows the microbes to stabilize the  organic pollutants in a controlled, artificial environment of steel and  concrete, rather than in a stream or lake.   This helps to protect the dissolved oxygen balance of the natural  aquatic environment.<br />
				  To  keep the microbes happy and productive in their task of wastewater treatment,  they must be provided with enough oxygen, adequate contact with the organic  material in the sewage, suitable temperatures, and other favourable  conditions.  The design and operation of  a secondary treatment plant is accomplished with these factors in mind.<br />
				  Two  of the most common biological treatment systems are the <strong>trickling filter</strong> and the <strong>activated  sludge</strong> process.  The trickling filter  is a type of fixed growth system.  The  microbes remain fixed or attached to a surface while the wastewater flows over  that surface to provide contact with the organics.  Activated sludge is characterized as a  suspended – growth system, because the microbes are thoroughly mixed and  suspended in the waste water rather than attached to a particular surface. <br />
  <strong>Aerobic waste water  treatment method </strong><br />
  <strong>Trickling filters</strong><br />
				  A  trickling filter consists basically of a layer or bed of crushed rock about 2m <br />
				  (6ft) deep.  It is usually circular in  shape and may be built as large as 60 m (200 ft) in diameter.   Trickling filters are always preceded by  primary treatment to remove coarse and settleable solids.   The primary effluent is sprayed over the  surface of the crushed stone bed and trickles downward through the bed to an  under drain system. <br />
				  A  rotary distributor arm with nozzles located along its length is usually used to  spray the sewage, although sometimes fixed nozzles are used.  The rotary distributor arm is mounted on a  center column in the trickling filter; it is driven around by the reaction  force or jet action of the waste water that flows through the nozzles. <br />
				  The  under drain system serves to collect and carry away the wastewater from the  bottom of the bed and to permit air circulation upward through the stones.  As long as topography permits, the sewage  flows from the primary tank to the trickling filter by the force of gravity,  rather than by pumping. As the primary effluent trickles downward through the  bed of stones, a biological slime of microbes develops on the surfaces of the  rocks. The continuing flow of the wastewater over these fixed biological  growths provides the needed contact between the microbes and the organics.  The microbes in the thin slime layer absorb  the dissolved organics, thus removing oxygen – demanding substances from the  waste – water.  Air circulating through  the void spaces in the bed of stones provides the needed oxygen for stabilization  of the organics by the microbes. <br />
				  The  stones are usually about 75 mm (3 in.) in size, much too large to  filter out suspended solids.  The stones in a trickling filter only serve  to provide a large amount of surface area for the biological growths, and the  large voids allow ample air circulation. The trickling filter effluent is  collected in the under drain system and then conveyed to a sedimentation tank  called a <strong>secondary clarifier</strong>. The  secondary clarifier, or final clarifier as it is sometimes called, is similar  in most respects to the primary clarifier, although there are differences in  detention time, over flow rate, and other details.<br />
				  To  maintain a relatively uniform flow rate thorough the trickling filter and to  keep  the distributor arm rotating even  during  periods of low sewage flow, some  of the waste water may be recirculated.   In other words, a portion of the effluent is pumped back to the  trickling filter inlet so that it will pass through the bed of stones more than  once. Recirculation can also serve to improve the pollutant removal efficiency;  it allows the microbes to remove organics that flowed by them during the  previous pass through the bed. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Activated sludge treatment </strong><br />
				  The  basic components of an activated sludge sewage treatment system include an  aeration tank a secondary settling basin or clarifier.  Primary effluent is mixed with settled solids  that are recycled from the secondary clarifier and then introduced into the  aeration tank.  Compressed air is  injected continuously into the mixture through porous diffusers located at the  bottom of the tank along one side. <br />
				  In  the aeration tank, microorganisms consume the dissolved organic pollutants as  food.  The microbes absorb and  aerobically decompose the organics, using oxygen provided in the compressed  air; water, carbon dioxide and other stable compounds are formed.  In addition to providing oxygen, the  compressed air thoroughly mixes the microbes and wastewater together as it  rapidly bubbles up to the surface from the diffusers.   Sometimes mechanical propeller like mixers,  located at the liquid surface, are used instead of compressed air and  diffusers.  The churning action of the  propeller blades mixes air with the wastewater and keeps the contents of the  tank in a uniform suspension.<br />
				  The  aerobic microorganisms in the tank grow and multiply, forming an active  suspension of biological solids called <strong>activated  sludge</strong>.  The combination of the  activated sludge and waste water in the aeration tank is called the mixed  liquor.  In the basic or conventional  activated sludge treatment system, a tank detention time of about 6h is  required for thorough stabilization of most of the organics in the mixed  liquor.<br />
				  After  about 6h of aeration, the mixed liquor flows to the secondary or final  clarifier, in which the activated sludge solids settle out by gravity.  The clarified water near the surface, called  the supernatant, is discharged over an effluent weir; the settled sludge is  pumped out from a sludge hopper at the bottom of the tank.   Recycling a portion of the sludge back to  the inlet of the aeration tank is an essential characteristic of this treatment  process.   The settled sludge is in an  active state.  In other words, the  microbes are well acclimated to the wastewater and, given the opportunity, will  readily absorb and decompose more organics by their metabolism.<br />
				  By  pumping about 30 per cent of the wastewater flow from the bottom of the  clarifier back to the head of the aeration tank, the activated sludge process  can be maintained continuously.  When  mixed with the primary effluent, the hungry microbes quickly begin to absorb  and metabolize the fresh food in the form of BOD causing organics.  Since the microbes multiply and increase  greatly in numbers, it is not possible to recycle or return all the sludge to  the aeration tank.  The excess sludge,  called waste activated sludge, must eventually be treated and disposed of  (along with sludge from the primary tanks). </p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Tertiary (Advanced)  Treatment</strong><br />
				  Secondary  treatment can remove between 85 and 95 per cent of the BOD and TSS in raw sanitary  sewage.  Generally, this leaves 30 mg / L  or less of BOD and TSS in the secondary effluent.   But sometimes this level of sewage treatment  is not sufficient to protect the aquatic environment.<br />
				  Another  limitation of secondary treatment is that it does not significantly reduce the  effluent concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous in the sewage.   Nitrogen and phosphorous are important plant  nutrients.   If they are discharged into  a lake, algal blooms and accelerated lake aging or cultural eutrophication may  be the result.   Also, the nitrogen in  the sewage effluent may be present mostly in the form of ammonia  compounds.  These compounds are toxic to  fish if the concentrations are high enough.   Yet another problem with the ammonia is that it exerts a nitrogenous  oxygen demand in the receiving water as it is converted to nitrates.  This process is called nitrification.<br />
				  When  pollutant removal greater than that provided by secondary treatment is  required, either to further reduce the BOD or TSS concentrations in the  effluent or to remove plant nutrients, additional or advanced treatment steps  are required.  This is also called<strong> tertiary treatment</strong>, because many of  the additional processes follow the primary and secondary processes in  sequence. <br />
				  Tertiary  treatment of sewage can remove more than 99 per cent of the pollutants from raw  sewage and can produce an effluent of almost drinking water quality. <br />
  <strong>Effluent polishing</strong><br />
				  The  removal of additional BOD and TSS from secondary effluents is sometimes  referred to as effluent polishing. It is most often accomplished using a  granular media filter much like the filters used to purify drinking water.  Since the suspended solids consist mostly of  organic compounds, filtration removes BOD as well as TSS.<br />
  <strong>Phosphorus Removal</strong><br />
				  When  stream or effluent standards require lower phosphorous concentrations, a  tertiary treatment process must be added to the treatment plant.  This usually involves chemical precipitation  of the phosphate ions and coagulation.   The organic phosphorous compounds are entrapped in the coagulant flocs  that are formed and settle out in a clarifier. <br />
				  One  chemical frequently used in this process is aluminium sulfate ( Al2SO4).  This is called <strong>alum</strong>, the same coagulant chemical used to purify drinking water.  The aluminium ions in the alum react with the  phosphate ions in the sewage to form the insoluble precipitate called aluminium  phosphate.  Other coagulant chemicals  that may be used to precipitate the phosphorous include ferric chloride (FeCl3),  and lime( CaO). <br />
  <strong>Nitrogen Removal </strong><br />
				  One  of the methods used to remove nitrogen is called biological nitrification –  denitrification. It consists of two basic steps.  First, the secondary effluent is introduced  into another aeration tank, trickling filter, or biodisc.  Since most of the carbonaceous BOD has  already been removed, the microorganisms that will now thrive in this tertiary  step are the nitrifying bacteria, <em>Nitrosomonas</em> and <em>Nitrobacter</em>.  In this first step, called <strong>nitrification</strong>, the ammonia nitrogen is converted  to nitrate nitrogen, producing a nitrified effluent.  At this point, the nitrogen has not  actually  been removed but only converted  to a form that is not toxic to fish and that does not cause an additional  oxygen demand.<br />
				  A  second biological treatment step is necessary to actually remove the nitrogen  from the wastewater.  This is called <strong>de nitrification</strong>.   It is anaerobic process in which the organic  chemical methanol is added to the nitrified effluent to serve as a source of  carbon.   The denitrifying bacteria <em>Pseudomonas </em> and other groups use the carbon from the  methanol and the oxygen from the nitrates in their metabolic processes.  One product of this biochemical reaction is  molecular nitrogen (N2), which escapes into the atmosphere as a gas.<br />
  <strong>Bioreactors</strong><br />
				  Certain organic hazardous wastes can  be treated in slurry form in an open lagoon or in a closed vessel called a <strong>bioreactor</strong>.  A bioreactor may have fine bubble diffusers  to provide oxygen and a mixing device to keep the slurry solids in suspension.<br />
  <strong>b. Anaerobic wastewater treatment methods  </strong><br />
				  The generation and disposal of large  quantities of biodegradable waste without adequate treatment result in  widespread environmental pollution. Some waste streams can be treated by  conventional methods like aeration. Compared to the aerobic method, anaerobic  digestion proves to be more advantageous in terms of efficiency of treatment as  well as potential energy savings. Biomethanation is the process of conversion  of organic matter in the waste (liquid or solid) to biogas and manure by  microbial action in the absence of air. Methane<strong> </strong>produced by methanogenic bacteria is also another potential energy  source. Methane is used for generation of mechanical, heat and electrical  energy. Anaerobic decomposition of waste materials produces large amounts of  methane. Many sewage treatment plants produce this fuel. Efficient generation  of methane can be achieved by using algal biomass grown in pond cultures,  sewage sludge, municipal refuse, plant residue and animal waste. Methanogens  (Archaebacteria) are obligate anaerobes and produce CH4 by reducing  acetate and/or CO2. <strong>Biogas</strong>,  a mixture of different gases is produced by anaerobic microbes using domestic  and agricultural wastes. Bulk (about 50 – 70%) of biogas is <strong>methane</strong> (CH4) and other  gases are in low proportions. These include CO2 (25 – 35%), H2  (1 – 5%), N2 (2 – 7%) and O2 (0 – 0.1%). In India a large  number of <strong>gobar gas plants </strong>are  already in operation in rural areas. Left overs of these plants are good  fertilizers also. Animal waste is first hydrolyzed by hydrolytic bacteria. It  is followed by acid formation by a group of acetogenic bacteria, which convert  monomers into simple compounds like NH3, CO2 and H2.  Finally methanogens reduce acetate and/or CO2 to CH4. In  India, cattle dung is the chief source of biogas. <br />
				  Biomethanation requires  adequate infrastructural facilities. The first and the foremost among them is  the bioreactor in which the treatment is to be carried out,  since extremely large volumes of effluents are  encountered for treatment. Thus, an optimally designed bioreactor can decrease  the treatment time and increase the treatment efficiency leading to an overall  lowering of the treatment cost. Selection and design of bioreactors are  dictated by process kinetics. Conventional digesters such as sludge digesters  and anaerobic CSTR (Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor) have been used for many  decades in sewage treatment plants for stabilizing the activated sludge and sewage  solids. Interest in biomethanation as an energy-saving waste treatment has led  to the development of a range of anaerobic reactor designs. These high-rate  digesters are also known as retained biomass reactors since they are based on  the concept of retaining viable biomass by sludge immobilization.<br />

			    </div>
				<h2 align="justify">Upflow Anaerobic Sludge  Blanket Reactor</h2>
				<p align="justify">Developed  at Wageningen Agricultural University, Netherlands (Lettinga, 1978), the UASB  reactor employs anaerobic bacteria especially methanogens, which have a  propensity to form self-immobilized granular structures with good settling  properties inside the reactor. These anaerobic bacteria granules make a  &quot;blanket&quot; through which the effluent flows up the reactor. The  substrate present in the effluent diffuses into the sludge granules, where it  is degraded by the anaerobic route. Thus, these reactors due to their high  biomass concentrations can achieve conversions several folds higher than that  possible by conventional anaerobic processes and tolerate fluctuations in  influent feed, temperature and pH. Moreover, since no support medium is  required for attachment of the biomass it decreases the capital cost and  minimizes the possibility of plugging. The energy requirement is also small  because there is no mechanical mixing within the reactor, no recirculation of  sludge, and no high recirculation of effluent.<br />
                </p>
				<h2 align="justify">Anaerobic Fluidized Bed (AFB)  Reactors</h2>
				<p align="justify">In these reactors mixed culture  bacteria are made to grow as a film on the surface of some inert carrier  particle. These particles are then maintained inside in a &quot;fluidized&quot;  state using the energy of the incoming effluent stream. The linear velocity of  the effluent is kept above the minimum fluidization velocity so that the  film-covered particles are always in motion and the bed appears to be boiling.  The substrate present in the liquid phase diffuses into the biofilm and gets  converted to VFAs and ultimately to methane. These products then diffuse out  through the biofilm into the bulk liquid. The mixing and mass transfer achieved  in these reactors is excellent and the resulting conversions are comparable or  even superior to those obtained for UASB reactors. These reactors have typical  loading rates of 25 KgCOD/m3 days. However, as the biofilm grows,  the film-covered particles increase in size, which is accompanied by a decrease  in their composite density. This causes the particle to move up in the bed  ultimately resulting in its leaving the reactor, thereby leading to a reduction  in the carrier particle concentration inside the reactor. This problem can be  overcome by removing the biofilm from the carrier particle which has exited the  reactor and then recycling the carrier particle (minus the biofilm) to the  reactor. However, it is observed that the transport of solid particles as a  rule creates too many operational problems let alone maintain strict anaerobic  conditions within the reactor. Another drawback of AFB reactors is the high  energy requirement due to the large recycle rates employed in these systems.<br />
                    <br />
				  Many  improved reactor designs for high rate biomethanation are being tried out in  this context. In spite of several bottlenecks in the smooth and efficient  operation of both UASB and AFB systems, there is hope that these systems have  the potential to offer an extremely high rate of waste stabilization  accompanied by methane production. <br />

                    <strong>Membrane Bio </strong><strong>reactor</strong> (MBRs) brings a new age of  biological waste water treatment. With pure oxygen the benefits of MBRs are  enhanced resulting in even higher rate biological treatment systems which  provide the control of COD, microorganisms and VOCs in waste water. Oxy-Dependent  MBR can use high biomass concentrations, which for air-based  systems cause oxygen transfer limitations. High purity oxygen resolves  this, as well as the foaming and VOC issues associated with air-based systems.<br />
                    <strong>Phytoremediation </strong><br />
				  Plants show several response patterns to the  presence of  potentially toxic  concentrations of heavy metal ions. Most   are sensitive even to very low concentrations, others have developed  resistance and a reduced number behave as hyperaccumulators of toxic metals .  This particular capacity to accumulate and tolerate large  metal concentrations has opened up the  possibility to use phytoextraction for remediation of polluted soils and  waters  Plants with metal resistance  mechanisms based on exclusion can be efficient for phytostabilization  technologies. Hyperaccumulator plants, in contrast, may become useful for  extracting toxic elements and thus decontaminate and restore fertility in  polluted areas. <br />
				  1. Phytoextraction: This technique reduces metal  concentrations by cultivating plants with a high  capacity   for metal accumulation in shoots. Plants used for this purpose should  ideally combine high metal accumulation in shoots and high biomass production.  Many hyperaccumulator species fulfill the first. but not the second condition.  Therefore, species that accumulate lower metal concentrations but are high  biomass producers may also be useful. <br />
				  2. Rhizofiltration: This technique is used for cleaning  contaminated  surface waters or  wastewaters by  adsorption or  precipitation of metals onto roots or absorption by roots or other submerged  organs of metal-tolerant aquatic plants. For this purpose, plants must not only  be metal-resistant but also have a high adsorption surface and must tolerate  hypoxia.<br />
				  3. Phytostabilization: Plants are used for immobilizing  contaminant metals by root uptake,   adsorption onto roots or precipitation in the rhizosphere. By decreasing  metal mobility, these processes prevent leaching and groundwater pollution.  Bioavailability is reduced and fewer metals enter the trophic web.<br />
				  4. Phytodegradation: Elimination of organic pollutants by  decomposition through plant enzymes or products.<br />
				  5. Rhizodegradation: Decomposition of organic pollutants  by means of rhizosphere microorganisms<br />
				  .6. Phytovolatilization: Organic pollutants absorbed by  plants are released into the atmosphere by transpiration,  either in their original form or after  metabolic modification. In addition, certain metals can be absorbed and  volatilized by certain organisms.<br />
  <strong>Mercury Pollution</strong><br />
				  Mercury  enters water naturally as well as through industrial effluents. It is a potent  hazardous substance. Both, inorganic and organic forms are highly poisonous.  Methyl mercury gives off vapors. Mercury was responsible for the <strong>Minamata </strong>epidemic that caused several  deaths, in Japan and Sweden. The tragedy had occurred due to consumption of  heavily mercury-contaminated fish (27 to 102 ppm, average 50 ppm) by the  villagers.     Chloralkali plants seem to  be the chief source of mercury containing effluents. <br />
				  Effluents  of industries making switches, batteries, thermometers, fluorescent light tubes  and high intensity street lamps also contain mercury. From the effluents  mercury compounds enter the water body and at their bottom these are  metabolically converted into methyl mercury compounds by anaerobic microbes.  Methyl mercury is highly persistent and thus accumulates in food chain. Methyl  mercury is soluble in lipids and thus after being taken by animals it  accumulates in fatty tissues. The symptoms of Minamata include malaise,  numbness, visual disturbance, dysphasia, ataxia, mental deterioration,  convulsions and final death. Mercury readily penetrated the central nervous  system of children born in Minamata causing teratogenic effects.<br />
  <strong>Lead Pollution</strong><br />
				  Lead  poisoning is common in adults. The chief source of lead to water is the  effluents of lead and lead processing industries. Lead toys may be chewed by children.  Painters also have a risk of lead consumption. In some plastic pipes lead is  used as stabilizer. The water may become contaminated in these pipes. Lead is  also used in insecticides, food, beverages, ointments and medicinal concoctions  for flavouring and sweetening.<br />
				  Lead  pollution causes damage to liver and kidney, reduction in hemoglobin formation,  mental retardation and abnormalities in fertility and pregnancy, chronic lead  poisoning may cause three general disease syndromes (i) gastrointestinal  disorders (ii) neuromuscular effects – weakness, fatigue muscular atrophy, and  (iii) central nervous system effects or CNS syndrome – that may result to coma  and death. Lead poisoning also causes constipation, abdominal pain etc.<br />
  <strong>Fluoride Pollution</strong><br />
				  Fluorine  is also regularly present in water and soil besides air. In nature it is found  as fluoride. The crop plants grown in high-fluoride soils in agricultural,  non-industrial areas had a fluoride content as high as 300 ppm. In Haryana and  Punjab, consumption of fluoride-rich water from well caused endemic fluorosis.  In Andhra Pradesh also high fluoride content water caused dental fluorosis. On  an average, about 20-25 million Indian are affected with fluorosis. In our  country this problem has become more severe in Rajasthan.<br />
				  Fluoride  is not absorbed in the blood stream. It has an affinity with calcium and thus  gets accumulated in bones, resulting in the mottling of teeth, pain in the  bones and joint and outward bending of legs from the knees knock knee syndrome.  Fluoride levels more than 0.5 ppm over over a period of 5-10 years results in  fluorosis terminating in crippling or paralysis. In water of most villages of  Rajasthan fluoride level is higher than permissible limit of 1 mg/litre of  water. The toxic effects are staining, mottling and abrasion of teeth, high  fluoride levels in bone and urine, decreased milk production, and lameness,  Animal becomes lethargic.<br />
  <strong>B. Marine Pollution</strong><br />
				  The  marine water represents a different kind of habitat for microorganisms. The  very vastness of the oceans and the variety of microbial life present in these  make the study of these a special branch of microbiology called marine  microbiology. The marine water contains algae, protozoa, yeasts, moulds,  bacteria and viruses. The  microorganism  which are  free - floating are  collectively known as the plankton and may consist of algae (phytoplankton) and  protozoa and minute animals (zooplankton).   Bacteria and fungi may also form part of the plankton. The algae are the  primary producers as they can photosynthesize while others are consumers at  various levels of the food - chain. The microorganisms found at the bottom of  the ocean are called the benthos or benthic microorganisms. A variety of  microorganisms are found in the benthic region but the bacteria predominate. <br />
				  In  polluted areas of estuarine regions rich in organic nutrients, organisms such  as <em>Beggiatoa,</em> <em>Thiothrix, Thiovolum</em> and various species of <em>Thiobacillu</em>s may be predominant. The transient bacteria may include  species of <em>Bacillus, Corynebacterium,  Sarcina,</em> Actinomyces and Gram - negative v<em>ibrio</em> - like organisms. A terminally bispored species of <em>Clostridium</em> which is unique to the ocean  is named <em>Clostridium oceanicum</em>.  Photosynthetic purple sulphur bacteria usually occur below algal mats in  anaerobic environs, as most of the light and oxygen is absorbed by algae. <br />
				  In  polluted waters, there are large amounts of organic matter from sewage, feces  and industrial complex. The microbes are usually heterotrophic. The digestion  of organic matter by these organisms is incomplete, due to which there  accumulate acids, bases, alcohols and various gases. The major types of  bacteria are coliform bacteria, the Gram-negative nonspore forming bacilli  usually found in the intestine. This group includes <em>E. coli</em> and species of <em>Enterobacter</em>.  They ferment lactose to acid and gas. Noncoliform bacteria-<em>Streptococcus, Proteus</em> and <em>Pseudomonas</em> are also present. <br />
				  Under  some conditions, the polluting organisms multiply rapidly and consume most of  the available oxygen. For instance, nutrients enter the river from sources like  sewage treatment plants or urban/suburban runoff. Thus river suddenly develops  a high nutrient content. Under these conditions algae may bloom rapidly. This  leads to depletion of oxygen in water. There is very little oxygen available to  the protozoa, small animals, fish and plants. Due to this non-availability of  oxygen, a layer of dead organisms, mud and silt accumulate at the bottom and  anaerobic species of <em>Clostridium,  Desulfovibrio</em> etc. will flourish and they produce gases. One gas, H2S  combines with lead or iron to give a precipitate which makes the mud black and  the water poisonous. Due to complete depletion of oxygen, the suspended  bacteria die in their own waste products. There is hardly any life in water at  this stage. The gas bubbles from the anaerobes in the mud break the surface and  such processes lead to death of a river.<br />
				  All  that what is carried by rivers ultimately ends up in the seas. On their way,  rivers receive huge amounts of sewage, garbage, agricultural discharge,  biocides, including heavy metals. These all are added to sea. Besides these  discharge of oils and petroleum products and dumping of radionuclides waste  into sea also cause marine pollution. Huge quantity of plastic is being added  to sea and oceans. Over 50 million Ib plastic packing material is being dumped  in sea of commercial fleets.</p>
				<p align="justify">The pollutants in sea may become dispersed by turbulence  and ocean currents or concentrated in the food chain. They may sediment at the  bottom by processes like adsorption, precipitation and accumulation.  Bioaccumulation in food chain may result into loss of species diversity.<br />
                    <strong>Marine pollution</strong><br />
				  It is defined as the discharge of waste  substances into the sea, posing threat to living sources, hazard to human  health, hindrance to fishery and impairment of quality of sea water. Marine  pollution is associated with the change in physical, chemical and biological  conditions of the sea water.  Nearly 71%  of Earth surfaces is covered with Oceans, which comprise a total of  approximately 1.37 x 1039 litres. Ocean is an ideal place to dump  all the man wastes. <br />

				<p align="justify"><strong>Tanker  operations</strong><br />
				  Half the world production of crude oil ,  which is closed to three billion tones per year, is transported by sea. After a  tanker has unloaded its cargo of oil, it has to take on sea water as ballast  for the return journey. This ballast water is stored in the cargo compartments  that previously contained the oil. During the unloading f the cargo certain  amount oil remains clinging to the walls of the container and this may amount  to 800 tonnes in a 2 lakh s container. The ballast water thus becomes contaminated  with this oil. When a fresh cargo of oil is to be loaded, these compartments  are cleaned with water, which discharges the dirty ballast along with the oil  into the sea. <br />
				  Two techniques have substantially reduced  the oil pollution. In the load- on- top system, the compartments are cleaned by  high pressure jets of water. The oily water is retained in the compartment  until the oil floats to the top. The water underneath that contains only a  little oil is then discharged into the sea and the oil is transferred tot a  slope tank. At the loading terminal, fresh oil is loaded on top of the oil in  the tank and hence the name of the technique. In the second method, called  crude oil washing , the cling age is removed by jets of crude oil by the cargo  is being unloaded. Some Modern Tankers have segregated ballast, where the  ballast water does not come in contact with this oil. Thus with the  introduction of these new methods of the ballast, the amount t of oil entering  the sea has been considerable reduced.<br />
  <strong>Dry Docking</strong><br />
				  All ships need periodic dry docking for servicing repairs, cleaning  the hull etc. During this period when the cargo compartments are to be  completely emptied, residual oil finds its way into the sea.<br />
  <strong>Bilge and fuel oils</strong><br />
				  As ballast tanks take up valuable space, additional ballast is  sometimes carried in empty fuel tnaks. While being pumped overboard it carries  into the sea. Individually, the quantity of oil released may be small, but it  sometimes becomes a considerable amount when all the shipping operations are  taken into consideration.<br />
  <strong>Tanker accidents</strong><br />
				  A large number of oil tanker accidents happen every year. Sometimes  this can result in major disasters , such as that of Exxon Valdez on marine  environment.<br />
  <strong>Offshore Oil Pollution</strong><br />
				  The oil that has extracted from the sea bed  contains some water. even after it is passed through oil separators the water  that is discharges contains some oil, which adds to marine pollution. Drilling  mud, which are pumped down oil wells when they are being drilled, normally  contain 70 to 80 % of oil. They are dumped on the sea bed beneath the drilling  platform, thus heavily contaminating the water. In addition, the controlled  release of oil from the wells can be catastrophic events resulting in oil  pollution<br />

                    <strong>Oil Degradation by superbug</strong><br />
				  Although many microorganisms can  metabolize petroleum hydrocarbon no single microbe possesses the enzymatic  capability to degrade all, or even most of   the compounds in a petroleum mixture. Recombinant DNA technology has  created a <strong>‘superbug’</strong> that is able to  degrade many hydrocarbon structures, that is potentially useful in oil  pollution abatement programmes. This hydrocarbon-degrading microbe,<em> Pseudomonas putida</em> is the first organism for which a patent has been  granted in the U.S.A. <strong></strong><br />
				  Different  strains of this bacterium contain a plasmid, which has genes for enzymes that  digest a single family of hydrocarbon.   These plasmids are designated based on the hydrocarbon they  metabolize.   Plasmid <em>CAM</em> digests camphor, <em>XYL</em>- xylene and toluene, <em>NAH</em>- naphthalene and <em>OCT</em>- octane.  By crossing various strains of this bacterium  a super bug was created.  It carries the  plasmids <em>XYL, NAH</em> and a hybrid  plasmid having <em>CAM </em>and <em>OCT</em> genes.  This multi plasmid bacterium can grow on a  diet of crude oil.  It has a potential of  cleaning up of oil spills as it degrade all the four families of hydrocarbons. <br />
  <strong>Water quality standards</strong><br />
				  In  the urbanized and industrialized world of today, it is necessary to have a  legal basis for protecting water quality.   It takes human effort, energy and money to keep water clean enough for  the many different uses for which society requires it.  Without a legal frame work to allow the  enforcement of water quality standards, environmental quality and public health  would be in constant jeopardy.<br />
				  Water  quality standards are limits on the amount of physical, chemical, or  microbiological impurities allowed in water that is intended for a particular  use.  These are legally enforceable by  governmental agencies and include rules and regulations for sampling, testing  and reporting procedures. <br />
