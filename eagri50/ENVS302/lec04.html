				<p align="justify">Ecology  is the science that deals with the relationships between living organisms with  their physical environment and with each other.   Ecology can be approached from the viewpoints of (1) the environment and  the demands it places on the organisms in it or (2) organisms and how they  adapt to their environmental conditions.   An ecosystem consists of an assembly of mutually interacting organisms and  their environment in which materials are interchanged in a largely cyclical  manner.  An ecosystem has physical,  chemical, and biological components along with energy sources and pathways of  energy and materials interchange.  The  environment in which a particular organism lives is called its habitat.  The role of an organism in a habitat is  called its niche.<br />
                For the study of ecology it is  often convenient to divide the environment into four broad categories.  </p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Terrestrial  environment - The terrestrial environment is based on land and consists of  biomes, such as grasslands, one of several kinds of forests, savannas, or  deserts.  </li>
				    <li>Freshwater environment - The  freshwater environment can be further subdivided between <em>standing-water habitats (</em>lakes, reservoirs) and <em>running-water habitats (</em>streams, rivers).</li>
				    <li>Oceanic marine environment  - The oceanic marine environment is  characterized by saltwater and may be divided broadly into the shallow waters  of the continental shelf composing the neritic zone</li>
				    <li>Oceanic  region - The deeper waters of the ocean that constitute the oceanic region.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">Two  major subdivisions of modern ecology are </p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Ecosystem ecology -  which views ecosystems as large units, and </li>
				    <li>Population ecology - which attempts to  explain ecosystem behavior from the properties of individual units.  </li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">In practice, the two approaches are usually  merged.  Descriptive ecology describes  the types and nature of organisms and their environment, emphasizing structures  of ecosystems and communities and dispersions and structures of  populations.  Functional ecology explains  how things work in an ecosystem, including how populations respond to  environmental alteration and how matter and energy move through ecosystems.<br />
				  Ecosystems are broadly divided into natural  and artificial.  <em>Natural ecosystems </em>are those that are existing in nature; they are  further classified into terrestrial and aquatic.  Terrestrial includes hot desert, grass land,  tropical and temperate rainforest and <em>aquatic </em>includes ponds, river, streams, lakes, estuaries, oceans, mangroves, swamps  and bays etc.  However these two  ecosystems are self regulating, open system with a free exchange of inputs and  outputs with other systems. Artificial ecosystems are simple, human-made,  unstable and subjected to human intervention and manipulation.  Usually it is formed by clearing a part of  the forest or grassland e.g. crop field, agricultural land.<br />
  <strong>Structure and Function of an ecosystem </strong><br />
				  An ecosystem has two components  the biotic components consisting of living things, and the abiotic portion,  consisting of elements that are not alive. The non living constituents are said  to include the following category, habitat, gases, solar radiation,  temperature, moisture and inorganic and organic nutrients. The living organisms  may be sub divided into producers, consumers and decomposers. Abiotic  Components include basic inorganic and organic components of the environment or  habitat of the organism. The inorganic components of an ecosystem are carbon  dioxide, water nitrogen, calcium phosphate all of which are involved in matter cycle  (biogeochemical cycles). The organic components of an ecosystem are proteins,  carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids, all of which are synthesized by the  biota (flora and fauna) of an ecosystem and are reached to ecosystem as their  wastes, dead remains etc. the climate 'microclimate' temperature, light soil  etc. are abiotic components of the ecosystems.<br />
  <strong>Functions of an Ecosytem</strong><br />
				  Ecosystem function is the capacity of natural  processes and components to provide goods and services that satisfy human  needs, either directly or indirectly. Ecosystem functions are subset of  ecological processes and ecosystem structures. Each function is the result of  the natural processes of the total ecological sub-system of which it is a part.  Natural processes, in turn, are the result of complex interactions between  biotic (living organisms) and abiotic (chemical and physical) components of  ecosystems through the universal driving forces of matter and energy. <strong>There  are four primary groups of ecosystem functions</strong> (1) regulatory functions,  (2) habitat functions, (3) production functions and (4) information functions.  This grouping concerns all ecosystems, not only for forests. <br />
  <strong>General  characterization of ecosystem functions are:</strong> <br />
  <strong>(1) Regulatory functions:</strong> this group of functions relates to the capacity of natural and semi-natural  ecosystems to regulate essential ecological processes and life support systems  through bio-geochemical cycles and other biospheric processes. In addition to  maintaining the ecosystem (and biosphere health), these regulatory functions  provide many services that have direct and indirect benefits to humans (i.e.,  clean air, water and soil, and biological control services). <br />
  <strong>(2) Habitat functions:</strong> natural ecosystems provide refuge and a reproduction habitat to wild plants and  animals and thereby contribute to the (in situ) conservation of biological and  genetic diversity and the evolutionary process. <br />
  <strong>(3) Production functions:</strong> Photosynthesis and nutrient uptake by autotrophs converts energy, carbon  dioxide, water and nutrients into a wide variety of carbohydrate structures  which are then used by secondary producers to create an even larger variety of  living biomass. This broad diversity in carbohydrate structures provides many  ecosystem goods for human consumption, ranging from food and raw materials to  energy resources and genetic material.<br />
  <strong>(4) Information functions:</strong> Since most of human evolution took place within the context of an  undomesticated habitat, natural ecosystems contribute to the maintenance of  human health by providing opportunities for reflection, spiritual enrichment,  cognitive development, recreation and aesthetic experience. <strong></strong><br />
				  <strong>Components of an ecosystem:</strong> Complete ecosystem consists of four  basic components such as producers, consumers, decomposers and abiotic  components e.g. Pond.  If anyone of these  four components are lacking, then it is grouped under incomplete ecosystem e.g.  Ocean depth or a cave.<br />
  <strong>Productivity  in the Environment:</strong> The productivity of an ecosystem is  the rate at which solar energy is fixed by the vegetation of the ecosystem; it  is further classified into primary productivity, secondary productivity and net  productivity.<br />
				  Primary productivity refers to  the rate at which radiant energy is stored by photosynthetic and chemosynthetic  activity of producers; it is further distinguished as gross primary  productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP).  It is expressed in terms of weight (g/m2/yr)  or energy (kcal/m2). Secondary productivity refers to the rates of  energy storage at consumer levels. <br />
				  An understanding of ecology is  essential in the management of modern industrialized societies in ways that are  compatible with environmental preservation and enhancement. The branch of  ecology that deals with predicting the impacts of technology and development  and making recommendations such that these activities will have minimum adverse  impacts, or even positive impacts, on ecosystems   may be termed as Applied Ecology. It is a  multidisciplinary approach .<br />
				  Interactions  among living organisms are grouped into two major groups <em>viz</em>.,</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Positive interactions</li>
				    <li>Negative interactions</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>I.   Positive interactions </strong><br />
				  Here the populations help one  another, the interaction being either one way or reciprocal. These include (i)  Commensalism, (ii) Proto co-operation and (iii) mutualism.<br />
  <strong>1.   Commensalism </strong><br />
				  In  this one species derives the benefits while the other is unaffected.<br />
				  Eg.  (i)  Cellulolytic fungi produce a number  of organic acids from cellulose which serve as carbon sources for  non-cellulolytic bacteria and fungi.<br />
				  (ii)  Growth factors are synthesised by certain  microorganisms and their excretion permits the proliferation of nutritionally  complex soil inhabitants.<br />
  <strong>2. Proto-cooperation </strong><br />
				  It is also called as non-obligatory  mutualism. It is an association of mutual benefit to the two species but  without the co-operation being obligatory for their existence or for their  performance of reactions.<br />
				  Eg.   N2 can be fixed by <em>Azotobacter</em> with cellulose as energy source provided     that a cellulose decomposer is present to  convert the cellulose to simple sugars or organic acids.<br />
  <strong>3.   Mutualism </strong><br />
				  Mutually beneficial  interspecific interactions are more common among organisms. Here both the  species derive benefit. In such association there occurs a close and often  permanent and obligatory contact more or less essential for survival of each.<br />
				  Eg.          (i)  Pollination by animals. Bees, moths, butterflies etc. derive food from hectar,  or other plant product and in turn bring about         pollination.<br />
				  (ii)   Symbiotic nitrogen fixation:<br />
				  Legume  - <em>Rhizobium</em> symbiosis. Bacteria  obtain food from legume and in turn fix gaseous nitrogen, making it available  to plant.<br />
  <strong>II. Negative interactions </strong><br />
				  Member of one population may eat  members of the other population, compete for foods, excrete harmful wastes or  otherwise interfere with the other population. It includes (i) Competition,  (ii) Predation, (iii) Parasitism and (iv) antibiosis.<br />
  <strong> (i)   Competition </strong><br />
				  It is a condition in which there  is a suppression of one organism as the two species struggle for limiting  quantities of nutrients O2 space or other  requirements.<br />
				  Eg.          Competition between <em>Fusarium oxysporum</em> and  <em>Agrobacterium   radiobacter</em>.<br />
  <strong>(ii)   Predation </strong> <br />
				  A predator is free living which  catches and kills another species for food. Most of the predatory organisms are  animals but there are some plants (carnivorous) also, especially fungi, which  feed upon other animals.<br />
				  Eg.          (i)             Grazing and browsing by animals on  plants.<br />
				  (ii)            Carnivorous plants such as <em>Nepenthes, Darligtoria, Drosera</em> etc.  consume                                           insects and other small animals  for food.<br />
				  (iii)          Protozoans feeding on bacteria.</p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>(iii.)   Parasitism</strong><br />
				  A parasite is the organism  living on or in the body of another organisms and deriving its food more or  less permanently from its tissues. A typical parasite lives in its host without  killing it, whereas the predator kills its upon which it feeds.<br />
				  Eg.   Species of <em>Cuscuta</em> (total stem  parasite) grow on other plants on which they depend for nourishment. <br />
				  Parasitism  may occur even with in the species. Hyperparasites which are chiefly fungi  growing parasitically on other parasites, (ie) Parasite on a parasite.<br />
				  Eg.           <em>Cicinnobolus cesatii</em> is found as hyperparasite on a number of powdery  mildew fungi.<br />
  <strong>(iv)   Antibiosis  </strong><br />
				  The phenomenon of the production  of antibiotic is called as antibiosis. Antibiotic is an organic substance  produced by one organism which in low concentration inhibits the growth of  other organism.<br />
				  Eg.          Streptomycin -   <em>S.griseus  , </em>          Penicillin  - P<em>.  notatum</em> , <em>Trichoderma harzianum</em> inhibits the       growth of  <em>Rhizoctonia</em> sp.</p>
				<strong>Matter and cycles of matter</strong>
				<p align="justify">                Biogeochemical cycles describe  the circulation of matter, particularly plant and animal nutrients, through  ecosystems.  These cycles are ultimately  powered by solar energy, fine-tuned and directed by energy expended by  organisms.  In a sense, the  solar-energy-powered hydrologic cycle acts as an endless conveyer belt to move  materials essential for life through ecosystems.<br />
                    <br />
				  Most  biogeochemical cycles can be described as elemental cycles involving nutrient  elements such as carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus.  Many are gaseous cycles in which the element  in question spends part of the cycle in the atmosphere – O2 for  oxygen, N2 for nitrogen, CO2 for carbon.  Others, notably the phosphorus cycle, do not  have a gaseous component and are called sedimentary cycles.                  All  sedimentary cycles involve salt solutions or soil solutions that contain  dissolved substances leached from weathered minerals that may be deposited as  mineral formations or they may be taken up by organisms as nutrients.  The sulfur cycle, which may have H2S  or SO2 in the gaseous phase or minerals (CaSO4 2H2O)  in the solid phase, is a combination of gaseous and sedimentary cycles.<br />
  <strong>Carbon Cycle</strong><br />
				  Carbon, the basic building block  of life molecules, is circulated through the carbon cycle.  This cycle shows that carbon may be present  as gaseous atmospheric CO2, dissolved in groundwater as HCO3  or molecular CO2 (aq), in underlying rock strata as limestone (CaCO3),  and as organic matter, represented in a simplified manner as (CH2O).  Photosynthesis fixes inorganic carbon as  biological carbon, which is a constituent of all life molecules.<br />
				  An important aspect of the  carbon cycle is that it is the cycle by which energy is transferred to  biological systems.  Organic or  biological carbon, (CH2O), is an energy-rich molecule that can react  biochemically with molecular oxygen, O2, to regenerate carbon  dioxide and produce energy.  This can  occur in an organism as shown by the “decay” reaction or it may take place as  combustion, such as when wood is burned.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Oxygen Cycle</strong><br />
			    The oxygen cycle involves the  interchange of oxygen between the elemental form of gaseous O2 in  the atmosphere and chemically bound O in CO2, H2O, and  organic matter.  Elemental oxygen becomes  chemically bound by various energy-yielding processes, particularly combustion  and metabolic processes in organisms.  It  is released during  photosynthesis.<br />
                </p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Nitrogen Cycle</strong><br />
				  Nitrogen, though constituting  much less of biomass than carbon or oxygen, is an essential constituent of  proteins.  The atmosphere is 78% by  volume elemental nitrogen, N2 and constitutes an inexhaustible  reservoir of this essential element.  The  N2 molecule is very stable so that breaking it down to atoms that  can be incorporated in inorganic and organic chemical forms of nitrogen is the  limiting step in the nitrogen cycle.   This does occur by highly energetic processes in lightning discharges  such that nitrogen becomes chemically combined with hydrogen or oxygen as  ammonia or nitrogen oxides.  Elemental  nitrogen is also incorporated into chemically bound forms or fixed by  biochemical processes mediated by microorganisms.  The biological nitrogen is returned to the  inorganic form during the decay of biomass by a process called mineralization.</p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Phosphorus cycle</strong><strong> </strong><br />
				  The phosphorus cycle is crucial  because phosphorus is usually the limiting nutrient in ecosystems.  There are no common stable gaseous forms of  phosphorus, so the phosphorus cycle is strictly sedimentary.  In the geosphere phosphorus is held largely  in poorly soluble minerals, such as  hydroxyapatite, a calcium salt.  Soluble  phosphorus from these minerals and other sources, such as fertilizers, is taken  up by plants and incorporated into the nucleic acids of biomass.  Mineralization of biomass by microbial decay  returns phosphorus to the salt solution from which it may precipitate as  mineral matter.<br />
                  <strong>Phosphorus cycle</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>Sulfur  cycle</strong><br />
				  The sulfur cycle is relatively complex. It  involves several gaseous species, poorly soluble minerals, and several species  in solution.  It is involved with the  oxygen cycle in that sulfur combines with oxygen to form gaseous sulfur di  oxide (SO2) an atmospheric pollutant, and soluble sulfate ion, (SO42-).  Among the significant species involved in the  sulfur cycle are gaseous hydrogen sulfide, H2S; mineral sulfides,  such as PbS; sulfuric acid, H2SO4, the main constituent  of acid rain; and biologically bound sulfur in sulfur-containing proteins.<br />
                  <strong>Sulfur cycle</strong><br />
                  <br />
				  <br />
				  It should be obvious that material cycles,  often based on elemental cycles, are very important in the environment.<br />
                  <strong>Energy  and cycles of energy</strong><br />
				  Biogeochemical cycles and  virtually all other processes on Earth are drive by energy from the sun.  The sun acts as a blackbody radiator with an  effective surface temperature of 5780 K (Celsius degrees above absolute  zero).  It transmits energy to earth as  electromagnetic radiation.  The maximum  energy flux of the incoming solar energy is at a wavelength of about 500  nanometers, which is in the visible region of the spectrum.  A 1 square meter area perpendicular to the  line of solar flux at the top of the atmosphere receives energy at a rate of  1,340 watts, sufficient, for example, to power an electric iron.  This is called solar flux.<br />
				  Energy in natural systems is  transferred by heat, which is the form of energy that flows between two bodies  as a result of their difference in temperature, or by work, which is transfer of  energy that does not depend upon a temperature difference, as governed by the  laws of thermodynamics.  The first law of  thermodynamics states that, although energy may be transferred or transformed,  it is conserved and is not lost.   Chemical energy in the food ingested by organisms is converted by  metabolic processes to work or heat that can be utilized by the organisms, but  there is no net gain or loss of energy  overall.  The second law of  thermodynamics describes the tendency toward disorder in natural systems.  It demonstrates that each time energy is transformed;  some is lost in the sense that it cannot be utilized for work, so only a  fraction of the energy that organisms derive from metabolizing food can be  converted to work; the rest is dissipated as heat.<br />
                  <strong>Energy Flow and Photosynthesis</strong><br />
			    Whereas  materials are recycled through ecosystems, the flow of useful energy may be  viewed as essentially a one-way process.   Incoming solar energy can be regarded as high-grade energy because it  can cause useful reactions to occur, the most important of which in living  systems is photosynthesis.  Solar energy  captured by green plants energizes chlorophyll, which in turn powers metabolic  processes that produce carbohydrates from water and carbon dioxide.  These carbohydrates represent stored chemical  energy that can be converted to heat and work by metabolic reactions with  oxygen in organisms.  Ultimately, most of  the energy is converted to low-grade heat, which is eventually re-radiated away  from Earth by infrared radiation.</p>
				<strong>Succession</strong>
				<p align="justify">                Environment is always kept on  changing over a period of time due to (1) variations in climatic and  physiographic factors, (2) the activities of the species of the communities  themselves. These influences bring about marked changes in the dominants of the  existing community, which is thus sooner or later replaced by another community  at the same place. This process continues and successive communities develop  one after another over the same area until the terminal final community again  becomes more or less stable for a period of time. It occurs in a relatively  definite sequence. This orderly change in communities is referred as  succession. Odum called this orderly process as ecosystem  development/ecological succession.<br />
				  Succession is an orderly process  of community development that involves changes in species structure and  community processes with time and it is reasonably directional and therefore  predictable. Succession is community controlled even though the physical  environment determines the pattern. <br />
  <strong>Causes of succession </strong><br />
				  Succession is a  series of complex processes, caused by  (I) Initial/initiating cause: Both climatic as  well as biotic. (II) Ecesis/continuing process ecesis, aggregation, competition  reaction etc. (III) Stabilizing cause: Cause the stabilization of the community.   Climate is the chief cause of  stabilization and other factors are of secondary value.<br />
  <strong>Types of succession </strong></p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Primary succession: Starts from the  primitive substratum where there was no previously any sort of living matter.  The first group of organisms establishing there are known as the pioneers,  primary community/primary colonizers. Very slow is the series of community  changes that takes place in disturbed areas that have not been totally stripped  their soil and vegetation.</li>
				    <li>Secondary succession:  Starts from previously built up substrata  with already existing living matter. Action of and external force, as a sudden  change in climatic factors, biotic intervention, fire etc, causes the existing  community to disappear. Thus area becomes devoid of living matter but its  substratum, instead of primitive is built up. Such successions are  comparatively more rapid.</li>
				    <li>Autogenic succession: Community -  result of its reaction with the environment, modified its own environment and  thus causing its own replacement by new communities. This course of succession  is autogenic succession.</li>
				    <li>Allogenic succession: Replacement of  the existing community is caused largely by any other external condition and  not by the existing organisms. </li>
				    <li>Autotrophic succession: Characterized  by early and continued dominance of autotrophic organisms like green plants.  Gradual increase in organic matter content supported by energy flow.</li>
				    <li>Heterotrophic succession:  Characterized by early dominance of heterotrophs, such as bacteria,  actinomyces, fungi and animals. There is a progressive decline in the energy  content.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>General Process of succession </strong><br />
				  (i)  Nudation:      Development of barren area  without any form of life. Cause of nudation: It may be (a) Topographic soil  erosion by wind (b) Climatic - storm, frost etc. (c) Biotic - man, disease and  epidemics.<br />
				  (ii) Invasion: Successful establishment of a  species in a barren area. This species actually reaches this new site from any  other area by (i) Migration, (ii) Ecesis and (iii) Aggregation.</p>

				<p align="justify"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Retrogressive succession:</strong><br />
				  Continuous biotic influences  have some degenerating influence on the process. Due to destructive effects of  organisms, the development of disturbed communities does not occur. Process of  succession, instead of progressive, it becomes retrogressive. (Eg.) Forest may  change to shrubby or grassland community.<br />
  <strong>Deflected succession:</strong><br />
				  Sometimes due to changes in  local conditions as soil character or microclimate the process of succession  becomes deflected in a different direction than that presumed under climatic  conditions of the area. Thus the climax communities are likely to be different  from the presumed climatic climax community.<br />
				  In India, with a monsoon type of climate, in  some habitats like temporary ponds, Pools etc. It is common to observe each  year, the development of different kinds of communities in different seasons of  the year - seasonal succession. But such changes are simply recurrent and not  developmental and should not be designated as successful. Species do not remain  unchanged indefinitely. In course of time many species become extinct and  disappeared forever. Or a species may form one or more new species that differ  from the original one. All these changes are result of evolution (ie) by the  process of evolution organism arise by modification from ancestral forms of  life.</p>
