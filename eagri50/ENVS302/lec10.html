				<p align="justify"><strong>Soil Pollution</strong><br />
				  Soil is the  loose and unconsolidated outer layer of earth’s crust that is powdery in nature  and made up of small particles of different sizes.  Soil ecosystem includes inorganic and organic  constituents, and the microbial groups.   Soil microorganisms are the active agents in the decomposition of plant  and animal solid wastes and said to be nature’s garbage disposal system.  The soil microbes keep our planet earth free  of unwanted waste materials and recycle the elements (C, N, and P) through  mineralization.  Soil microbes decompose  a variety of compounds, cellulose, lignin, hemi cellulose, proteins, lipids,  hydrocarbons etc.  The soil microbial  community has little or no action on many man made synthetic polymers.  The persistent molecules that fail to be metabolized  or mineralized have been termed as recalcitrants. <br />
  <strong>Soil pollutants</strong></p>
				<h2 align="justify">Pesticide pollution</h2>
				<p align="justify">                In modern  agriculture the use of various agrochemicals is a common practice.  These include pesticides, herbicides,  insecticides, fungicides and others.   Pesticides applied on seed or foliage ultimately reach the soil.  Accumulation of pesticide residues in the biosphere creates ecological stress  causing contamination of soil, water, and food.   Persisting chemicals may also be hazardous  to human health and should be eliminated. Persistent pesticides may accumulate  in the bodies of animals and over a period of time increase in concentration if  the animal is unable to flush leading to bioaccumulation. When an affected  animal is eaten by a carnivore, the pesticide is further concentrated in the  carnivore. This phenomenon ie. Increasing in the concentration of a  nondegradable substance along the food chain is called Biomagnification.<br />
				  Another problem  associated with insecticides is the ability of insects become resistant. Most  pesticides kill beneficial predators and parasites. The short term and long  term health effects to the persons using the pesticides and public that  consumes the food are the major concerns. Exposure to small quantities for longer  time causes mutations leads to cancer. Pesticides or their metabolites affect  many soil microbes and their activities.   Seed treatment with mercuric fungicides are found to be inhibitory to <em>Rhizobium </em>(nodulation and nitrogen fixation), <em>Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter </em>(nitrification). </p>
				<h2 align="justify">Fertilizer pollution</h2>
				<p align="justify">                The  agricultural production depends on chemical fertilizer application, as most of  our high yielding varieties are fertilizer responsive.  Continuous application of chemical  fertilizers alone lead to deterioration of soil properties and cultivated soils  loose their natural characteristics.   Fertilizers like ammonium sulphate, ammonium chloride and urea reduce  the soil pH.  Many crops, like potato,  grapes, citrus, beans are sensitive to chloride toxicity. In integrated  nutrient management, to sustain the productivity of our soils, organic manures  and bio fertilizers are recommended as supplements to chemical fertilizers.<br />
                    <strong>Nitrate pollution</strong><br />
				  Nitrogen occurs  in many forms in the environment and takes part in many biochemical  reactions.  The four forms of nitrogen  that are of particular significance in environmental technology are organic  nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen.  In water contaminated with sewage, most of  the nitrogen is originally present in the form of complex organic molecules  (protein) and ammonia (NH3).   These substances are eventually broken down by microbes to form nitrites  and nitrates.  <br />
				  Nitrogen,  particularly in the nitrate form, is a basic nutrient that is essential to the  growth of plants.  Excessive nitrate  concentrations in surface waters encourage the rapid growth of microscopic  plants called algae andexcessive  growth of algae degrades water quality.  <br />
				  Nitrates can  enter the ground water from chemical fertilizers used in agricultural  areas.  Excessive nitrate concentrations  in drinking water pose an immediate and serious health threat to infants under  3 months of age. The nitrate ions react with blood hemoglobin, reducing the  blood’s ability to carry oxygen and this produces a disease called <strong><em>blue  baby</em></strong>or<em> methemoglobinemia. </em></p>

				<p align="justify"><strong>Excess  Salts and Water</strong><br />
				  Irrigation water helps to produce more yield  than rain fed land. Irrigation water contains dissolved salts and in dry season,  water is in the form of saline solution evaporates leaving its salts such as  NaCl in the top soil. This saline soil causes stunted plant growth, lower  yield. Flushing out salts reduces the salinity but makes downstream irrigation  water, saltier. Another problem is water logging.</p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Heavy metal pollution </strong><br />
				  Heavy metals  include all metals with atomic numbers greater than 23 (with few exceptions) or  more than 5 gm per ml. (eg. Hg, 70 gm ml-1).  Heavy metals are hazardous, not acceptable to  biological system.  They are toxic to man  and other life forms.  Most of them are  slow poisons as they accumulate in the body and cause serious disorders.  Mercury, lead, arsenic, chromium and cadmium  are the five most common toxic heavy metals and they have serious effects on  human health .</p>

                <p align="justify">                The unique  physical, chemical and toxic properties of heavy metals have promoted their  wide use in industrial processes and as biocides (fungicide and  herbicide).  As a result, higher  concentration of these heavy metals accumulates in the environment, causing  public health hazards and ecological problems.   Removal of these metals is therefore a challenge to environmental  management.  The metals are generally removed  by ion exchange and sorption to resins and precipitation as metal sulphides. Biodegradation  of metals is not possible, because unlike organic pollutants, metals as  elements cannot be mineralized to non-toxic compounds such as H2O  and CO2.   However,  biomobilization is a valid concept in the management of metal pollution.  Eukaryotic organisms detoxify heavy metals by  binding to polythiols and bacteria have developed different and efficient  mechanisms for tolerating heavy metals.   They carry the genes controlling metal resistance on chromosome and  plasmids, plasmids often contain genes resistance to several metals (Hg, Pb,  As, Cr, Cd, Mo, U). As a result of biological action, metals undergo changes in  valency and or conversion into organo metallic compounds.<br />
                    <strong>Industrial Wastes: </strong>Indiscriminate dumping of untreated or inadequately treated  domestic, mining and industrial wastes on and is an important source of soil  pollution. Fall out of gaseous and particulate air pollutants from mining and  smelting operations, smoke stacks etc. are the major source of soil pollutants  in nearby areas.</p>

                          <p>Soil washing is a water-based process for    scrubbing soils ex situ to remove contaminants. The process removes    contaminants from soils in one of the following two ways:</p>
                        <ul type="disc">
                            <li>By dissolving or suspending         them in the wash solution (which can be sustained by chemical         manipulation of pH for a period of time); or </li>
                          <li>By concentrating them into a         smaller volume of soil through particle size separation, gravity         separation, and attrition scrubbing (similar to those techniques used in         sand and gravel operations). </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The concept of reducing soil    contamination through the use of particle size separation is based on the    finding that most organic and inorganic contaminants tend to bind, either    chemically or physically, to clay, silt, and organic soil particles. The silt    and clay, in turn, are attached to sand and gravel particles by physical    processes, primarily compaction and adhesion. Washing processes that separate    the fine (small) clay and silt particles from the coarser sand and gravel    soil particles effectively separate and concentrate the contaminants into a    smaller volume of soil that can be further treated or disposed of. Gravity    separation is effective for removing high or low specific gravity particles    such as heavy metal-containing compounds (lead, radium oxide, etc.).    Attrition scrubbing removes adherent contaminant films from coarser    particles. However, attrition washing can increase the fines in soils    processed. The clean, larger fraction can be returned to the site for    continued use. Soil washing is generally considered a media transfer    technology. The contaminated water generated from soil washing are treated    with the technology(s) suitable for the contaminants. The duration of soil    washing is typically short- to medium-term. </p></td>

The drainage itself may be treated in a bioreactor  before recycling. Vendors have developed proprietary nutrient and additive  formulations and methods for incorporating the formulation into the soil to  stimulate biodegradation. The formulations are usually modified for  site-specific conditions.<br />
				  Soil piles and cells commonly have an  air distribution system buried under the soil to pass air through the soil  either by vacuum or by positive pressure. The soil piles in this case can be up  to 20 feet high (generally not recommended, 2-3 meters maximum). Soil piles may  be covered with plastic to control runoff, evaporation, and volatilization and  to promote solar heating. If there are VOCs in the soil that will volatilize  into the air stream, the air leaving the soil may be treated to remove or  destroy the VOCs before they are discharged to the atmosphere. It  is a short-term technology. Duration of  operation and maintenance may last a few weeks to several months. <strong></strong></p>

				<p align="justify"><strong>Organic /  Sustainable Agriculture</strong></p>
				<p align="justify">Organic  farming is a holistic approach which aims for the production of quality and  safe agriculture products for consumption. This system requires less financial  and external inputs and provides sustainable income to the farming community.  Organic farming aims at production of quality and safe agricultural products  which contain no chemical residues due to the adoption of eco-friendly  production methods and farming systems that restore and maintains soil  fertility. <br />
				  Organic farming is a production method which  does not pollute the soil and ground water with chemical residues and provides  safe and quality food for consumption. It also increases the biological  diversity of plants and animals that helps to maintain the natural eco balance.  This approach also aims to recycle only the natural resources and restricts the  use of external inputs which indirectly helps to reduce the energy consumption  in the farming system considerably. <br />
				  The  vision of organic farming in India has necessitated the government to launch  the National programme for organic production (NPOP) during 2000. By National  accreditation policy and programme, the government has also implemented the  National standards for various organic farming activities. Hence organic  farming has to be promoted in a big way to provide quality and safe food to the  growing population and also to protect the environmental degradation. <strong></strong><br />
  <strong>Concepts of Organic Farming</strong><br />
				  Organic  farming aspires to a complex mix of agronomic, environmental,  agricultural and processing and are based on  a number of principles. They are:</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>To produce food of high quality and safety</li>
				    <li>To interact in a constructive and life-enhancing way with natural  systems and cycles</li>
				    <li>To consider the wider social and ecological impact of the organic  production and processing system</li>
				    <li>To encourage and enhance biological cycles within the farming systems,  involving microorganisms, soil flora and fauna, plants and animals</li>
				    <li>To develop a valuable and sustainable aquatic ecosystem</li>
				    <li>To maintain and increase the long term fertility of soils</li>
				    <li>To promote the healthy use and proper care of water, water resources,  and all life therein</li>
				    <li>To use, as far as possible, renewable resources in locally organized  production systems</li>
				    <li>To create a harmonious balance between crop production and animal  husbandry</li>
				    <li>To minimize all forms of pollution</li>
				    <li>To process organic products using renewable resources</li>
				    <li>To produce fully biodegradable organic products.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">These principles are given equal importance as that of other  economically viable production technologies.<br />
                    <strong>Organic Farming Requirements </strong><br />
				  Achieving  the above mentioned principles of organic farming needs a holistic farming  system with integrated approach in all aspects.   The basic principle of organic farming in enhancing the soil fertility  can be achieved through proper recycling of organic wastes, versatile crop  rotation and cropping systems, a wide range of biological methods for control  of pests, diseases and weeds and to avoid the use of synthetic fertilizers,  chemical pesticides and herbicides. Habitat development is the key factor in  restoring the natural eco-system which in turn facilitates the symbiotic  co-existence of fauna and flora apart from promoting natural predators,  parasites etc.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ol start="1" type="a">
				    <li><strong>Maintaining       soil fertility</strong></li>
			      </ol>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">Depletion  of soil organic matter under intensive cropping system is the key factor in  altering biological equilibrium of the soil ecosystem. It is essential to  maintain the soil food web, where all the soil organisms viz, bacteria, fungi,  actinomycetes, protozoa, earthworms etc, and they flourish in population in the  presence of sufficient amount of soil organic matter.   In order to maintain the soil fertility, the  following farming practices are recommended.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ol start="1" type="a">
				    <ul type="disc">
				      <li>Increased        use of organic manures, green manures<strong></strong></li>
				      <li>Enriched        vermicompost and bio composts<strong></strong></li>
				      <li>Use        of bio fertilisers<strong></strong></li>
				      <li>Crop        rotation with high and low biomass crops</li>
				      <li>Avoiding        the use of chemical fertilizers</li>
			        </ul>
				    <li><strong>Plant       Protection methods</strong></li>
			      </ol>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">        Indiscriminate use of chemical pesticides  and herbicides leads to soil and ground water contamination which causes health  problems in living systems. The accumulation of toxic residues in the food  products has created considerable awareness among the producers and consumers.  The reports on the pesticides residue in food products revealed that, most of  the food products from conventional agriculture contain more than 70 per cent  residues. In addition, it also impairs the soil microflora that is essential to  maintain soil fertility. These problems can be solved by adopting organic  farming practices which uses only the natural bio pesticides for plant  protection. Generally bio pesticides, bio control agents, plant extracts etc  are used for controlling the pest and disease problems.<br />
				  <strong>c. Animal husbandry</strong><br />
				  The  basis for including animal husbandry in the system is to respect the  physiological and ecological needs of animals. This is achieved by providing  sufficient quantities of good quality organic fodder, Shelters according to  their behavioral needs and also by proper veterinary treatment. Animals are an  important part of organic system because they act as the agents for recycling  of byproducts with value addition. Further contribute to complete the nutrient  cycle and maintaining soil fertility. They also contribute draught energy for  agricultural operations and provide essential manure for soil nutrition and  urine for pesticides.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <ul>
				      <li><strong>Processing of organic products</strong></li>
			        </ul>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">The basis of processing organic products is  that as far as possible the vital qualities of the products are maintained  throughout each step of the process. This is achieved by choosing and  developing methods which are adequate to the specifications of the ingredients  and by developing standards which emphasize careful processing methods, limited  refining, energy saving technologies, minimal use of additives and processing  aids etc. The production and handling of organic products in a safe way can be  achieved by adopting existing standards or by developing new standards, which  define the safe methods of waste management in the form of products besides  packing systems and energy saving systems in processing and transport.<br />
				  The Indian domestic market being quite large,  there is ample opportunity for marketing the products especially the organic  products in the country. Greater opportunities are also available for exporting  certified organic products to counties like USA, Japan and European Union.  Although some farmers are practicing organic agriculture, their awareness on  certification is limited and they are yet to recognize the importance of  certification.</p>
