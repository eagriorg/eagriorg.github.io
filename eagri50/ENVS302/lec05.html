				<p align="justify">Our environment consisting of both  living and non-living systems, influence each other in form, function and  property which is necessary to maintain life.   The composition of the living and the non-living systems are the  building blocks of an ecosystem. <br />
                    <strong>Producers</strong><br />
				  In an ecosystem, producers are those organisms  that use photosynthesis to capture energy by using sunlight, water and carbon  dioxide to create carbohydrates, and then use that energy to create more  complex molecules like proteins, lipids and starches that are crucial to life  processes. Producers, which are mostly green plants, are also called  autotrophs. <br />
  <br />
				  Producers funnel  into the ecosystem the energy needed for its biological processes. The  carbohydrates and other organic chemicals formed by the producers are utilized  by the heterotrophs, or consumers; first by the herbivores who eat the  plants--the primary consumers--then by the predators who eat the  herbivores--the secondary, tertiary, and so on consumers. But at each step,  much energy is lost. Less than 10 percent of the energy stored in plants is  converted to herbivore mass. The loss from herbivore to predator is similar.  Thus energy needs to be added to the ecosystem continuously. <br />

				<p align="justify"><strong>Consumers</strong><br />
				  Consumers are organisms (including humans)  that get their energy from producers, regarding the flow of energy through an  ecosystem. For example, producers, (such as plants), make their own food by the  process of photosynthesis. An organism ate this plant, than it would be a  primary consumer. The animal that eats <em>this</em> animal is known as the second order consumer. Scientifically, all consumers are  either herbivores, carnivores, omnivores or detrivores (decomposers and other  organism that break down organic matter). These 'orders' are known as trophic  levels.<br />
  <br />

                </div>
                <p align="justify"><strong>Decomposers</strong><br />
				  Decomposers eventually convert all organic  matter into carbon dioxide (which they respire) and nutrients. This releases  raw nutrients (such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and magnesium) in a a form usable  to plants and algae, which incorporate the chemicals into their own cells. This  process resupplies nutrients to the ecosystem, in turn allowing for greater  primary production. Although decomposers are generally located on the bottom of  ecosystem diagrams such as food chains, food webs, and energy pyramids,  decomposers in the biosphere are crucial to the environment. By breaking down  dead material, they provide the nutrients that other organisms need to survive.  As decomposers feed on dead organisms, they leave behind nutrients. These  nutrients become part of the soil. Therefore, more plants can grow and thrive.</p>

				<p align="justify"><strong>Ecological  pyramids </strong><br />
				  The trophic structure and  function at successive trophic levels, i.e. producers - herbivores -  carnivores, may be shown graphically by means of ecological pyramids where the  first or producer level constitutes the base of the pyramid and the successive  levels, the tiers making the apex. <br />
				  The graphic  expression of the trophic structure and function at successive trophic level is  referred as “Ecological Pyramids”. Ecological Pyramids are of three types;<br />
				  i)             Pyramid of numbers refers to number of individual organisms  at each    level.<br />
				  ii)            Pyramid of biomass refers to total dry weight of total  amount of living matter</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Pyramid of  energy shows the rate of energy flow/productivity at successive energy level.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">                The pyramids of numbers and  biomass may be upright or inverted depending upon the nature of the food chain  in the particular ecosystem, whereas pyramids of energy are always upright.<br />
				  Tertiary  consumers (carnivores)<br />
				  Secondary consumers<br />
				  Primary consumers (herbivores)<br />
				  Producers</p>
				<h5 align="justify">Pyramid of numbers </h5>
				<p align="justify">                It shows the relationship  between producers, herbivores and carnivores at successive trophic level in  terms of their numbers. In grassland ecosystem, producers are maximum in  number. This number then shows a decrease towards apex as the primary  consumer/herbivore are lesser in number than producers and tertiary consumers  are least in number. So pyramid becomes upright. But in forest ecosystem,  producers are lesser in number, which forms the base of pyramid. Herbivores -  fruit/eating birds, elephants, deers etc. are more in number than producers.<br />
				  In parasitic food chain,  pyramids are always inverted. Number of organisms gradually shows an increase  making the pyramid inverted. <br />
  <strong>Pyramids of Biomass </strong><br />
				  In grassland and forest  ecosystems, the pyramid of biomass shows an upright position. But in ponds and  other aquatic systems, producers are small organisms and biomass is also least.  This value shows an increase towards the apex of the pyramid and making the  pyramid inverted.<br />
  <strong>Pyramids of Energy </strong><br />
				  Of the three types of ecological  pyramid, this energy of pyramid gives the best picture of overall nature of the  system. It is a picture of the rates of passage of food mass through food  chains. So it’s shape is always upright. Because there is always a gradual  decrease in the energy content at successive trophic levels from the producers to  various consumer.<br />
                </p>
				<p align="justify"><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong>Energy flow models</strong><br />
				  The behaviour of energy in an ecosystem  can be termed, as energy flow. It is always unidirectional. From energetics  point of view it is essential to understand for an ecosystem  (i)   the efficiency of the producers in absorption and conversion of solar  energy. (ii) the use of this converted chemical form of energy by the consumers.  (iii) the total input of energy in form of food and its efficiency of  assimilation. (iv) the loss through respiration heat, excretion etc., and (v)  the gross net production.<br />
				  There  are two models to explain the flow of energy.<br />
				  1. Single channel energy models  (SCEM)<br />
				  2. ‘Y’ shaped/2 channel energy  flow models<br />
  <strong>Single channel energy model</strong><br />
				  This model explains the  unidirectional flow of energy. Whatever the energy captured by the autotrophs  does not revert back to solar input. As it moves progressively through the  various trophic levels, it is no longer available to the previous level. </p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul type="disc">
				    <li>the system would collapse if the primary       source, the sun, were cut off. </li>
				    <li>there is a progressive decrease in energy       level at each trophic level. </li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">So,  shorter the food chain, greater would be the available food energy.  <br />
                    <strong>“Y” shaped energy flow model</strong><br />
				  It is applicable to both  terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In this energy model, one arm represents  herbivore food chain and the other arm represents the decomposer (detritus)  food chain. The primary producers are entirely different for each arms.  This model also indicates that two food  chains are infact, under natural conditions, not completely isolated from one  another. </p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>it confirms to the basic stratified  structure of ecosystem. </li>
				    <li>it separates the grazing and detritus  food chains in both time and space, and</li>
				    <li> micro consumers and macro consumers differ  greatly in size and metabolic relations.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"> <br />
                    <strong> </strong> <br />
                    <strong>Universal model of energy flow </strong><br />
				  Proposed by Odum. It is applicable to any  living component whether a plant, animal /microorganisms or individual/population  or a trophic group. It may depict food chain as shown in single/Y shaped energy  flow system or bioenergetics of entire system.<br />
				  These  models depict the basic pattern of energy flow in ecosystem. Under natural  conditions, these organisms are inter related in a way that several food chains  become interlocked this results into a complex food web. Complexity of food web  depends on the length of the food chain. Thus in nature, there operate multi  channel energy flows. But in these the channels belong to either of the two  basic food chains - Grazing or Detritus. Interlocking pattern of such several  chains in food web of an ecosystem would lead to a multi channel flow of  energy. Thus in practice, under food conditions, it is difficult to measure the  energetics of the ecosystem.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Food  Chain</strong><br />
				  A <strong>food chain</strong> shows how each living thing gets its food. Some animals eat  plants and some animals eat other animals. For example, a simple food chain  links the trees &amp; shrubs, the giraffes (that eat trees &amp; shrubs), and  the lions (that eat the giraffes). Each link in this chain is food for the next  link. A food chain always starts with plant life and ends with an animal.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ol start="1" type="1">
				    <li>Plants are called <strong>producers</strong> because they are able to use light energy from the Sun to produce food       (sugar) from carbon dioxide and water.</li>
				    <li>Animals cannot make their own       food so they must eat plants and/or other animals. They are called <strong>consumers</strong>.       There are three groups of consumers.</li>
				    <ol start="1" type="a">
				      <li>Animals that eat ONLY PLANTS are        called <strong>herbivores</strong> (or primary consumers).</li>
				      <li>Animals that eat OTHER ANIMALS        are called <strong>carnivores</strong>.</li>
				      <ul type="square">
				        <li>carnivores that eat herbivores         are called secondary consumers</li>
				        <li>carnivores that eat other         carnivores are called tertiary consumers<br />
				          e.g., killer whales in an ocean food web ... phytoplankton → small         fishes → seals → killer whales</li>
			          </ul>
			        </ol>
				    <li>Animals and people who eat BOTH       animals and plants are called <strong>omnivores</strong>.</li>
				    <li>Then there are decomposers (bacteria and fungi)       which feed on decaying matter. These decomposers speed up the decaying       process that releases mineral salts back into the food chain for       absorption by plants as nutrients.</li>
			      </ol>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">                The consumer organisms are  heterotrophic. Unlike the autotrophic plants, which manufacture their own food  from simple inorganic chemicals, the herbivores must utilize the energy-rich  compounds synthesized by the plants. In turn, the carnivores obtain energy for  their metabolism when they consume the herbivores. <br />

  <strong>Food  Web </strong><br />
				  There cannot be too many links in a single  food chain because the animals at the end of the chain would not get enough  food (and hence energy) to stay alive. Most animals are part of more than one  food chain and eat more than one kind of food in order to meet their food and  energy requirements. These interconnected food chains form a <strong>food web</strong> ie.  Interlocking pattern of food chain is called  food web.<strong></strong><br />
  <strong> </strong></p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p align="justify"> This interdependence of the populations within a  food chain helps to maintain the balance of plant and animal populations within  a community. For example, when there are too many zebras; there will be  insufficient shrubs and grass for all of them to eat. Many zebras will starve  and die. Fewer zebras means more time for the shrubs and grass to grow to  maturity and multiply. Fewer zebras also mean less food is available for the  lions to eat and some lions will starve to death. When there are fewer lions,  the zebra population will increase. </p>

				<h2 align="justify">Ecosystems</h2>
				<p align="justify">The first steps  in the evolution of agriculture were the tending of particular plant species  and the taming of useful animal species. The next steps were (a) domestication  of these species so as to gain control of their reproduction thereby enabling selective  breeding of more productive types and (b) creation of special environmental  conditions which would enable these improved types to realize their higher  production potential. These environmental modifications involve soil tillage,  soil water management, weeding and pest control. The resulting combination of  humans, domesticated plant and animal species and their modified environments  is an <em>agro-ecosystem</em>, in contrast to natural ecosystems in which humans  play no special role. In agro-ecosystems, the farmer is an essential ecological  variable, influencing or determining the composition, functioning and stability  of the system.<br />
				  Agro-ecosystems  may be viewed as food procurement systems in which the natural ecosystem has  been modified to various degrees in order to increase output of food and other  useful products of value to humans. The dominants in agro-ecosystems are  selected plant and animal species which are tended and harvested by humans for  particular purposes. According to the nature of the modifications,  agro-ecosystems range from shifting agriculture, nomadic pastoralism, and  non-industrial continuous agriculture to ranching, industrial agriculture and  feedlot animal production. The first three systems are practiced primarily for  subsistence, and may therefore be called <strong>subsistence agro-ecosystems</strong>,  while the last three are <strong>industrial agro-ecosystems</strong> which are geared to  a market economy. Agro-ecosystems which involved field crop husbandry <em>viz</em>.,  shifting agriculture, non-industrial continuous agriculture and industrial  agriculture are also referred to as field crop ecosystems.<br />
  <strong>Intensive and extensive agro  ecosystems</strong><br />
				  Agro-ecosystems  are classifiable according to whether they are extensive or intensive.  Extensive systems may be defined as those where the annual output of consumable  nitrogen is less than 20 kg per ha. Outputs of crop or livestock products per  unit area are low, and these outputs are dependent largely on natural soil  nutrient reserves and management which conserves these reserves. Forms of  subsistence agriculture such as nomadic pastoralism and shifting agriculture  are widespread examples.<br />
				  In  intensive agro-ecosystems, very high outputs are maintained by large inputs of  nutrients. Both the volume and rate of nutrient cycling are much higher than in  extensive systems, particularly in industrial agriculture. Since nutrient  inputs are almost entirely in the form of inorganic fertilizers, nitrogen  fixation and soil organic matter are both depressed to very low levels. Losses  of nutrients from the system through exports of produce are great, while  considerable leaching losses, of both soil nutrient reserves and nutrient  inputs occur particularly in wetter environments when land is bare during part  of the growing season.<br />
				  Agro-ecosystems  which involve a significant livestock sub-system as well as a cropping  sub-system are known as <em>mixed farming</em> systems. They are usually  intermediate in intensity between extensive and intensive agro-ecosystems.<br />
  <strong>Shifting agriculture</strong> <br />
				  Shifting  agriculture is a very widespread agro-ecosystem in the tropics. It includes a  wide range of different localized systems which have developed in response to  local environmental and cultural conditions. The essential features of the  agro-ecosystem are that fields are rotated rather than crops, and a fallow  period restores soil fertility. Disturbance to the soil is also negligible  since there is no soil tillage. The system is well suited to nutrient poor  soils in areas of low population density. Provided the fallow period is long enough,  relative to the cropping period, the agro-ecosystem is sustainable  indefinitely. The cropping phase is just another human induced and managed  disturbance in the natural, continuing pattern of gap creation and secondary  succession in forest. The cleared area, during the period of cropping, is often  referred to as a swidden.<br />
				  Because  of their great age and highly leached condition, most soils in the moist  tropics are too poor to sustain high levels of crop production without  fertilizer application. In shifting agriculture, the fertilizer requirement is  provided in the form of ash by felling and burning the forest vegetation prior  to cropping. When the land is abandoned after one to three years of cropping,  soil regains its original fertility characteristics through forest  regeneration, provided the fallow period is of sufficient duration.<br />
  <strong>Nomadic Pastoralism</strong> <br />
				  Nomadic  pastoralism is a subsistence agro-ecosystem which usually prevails in semi-arid  or arid regions which are too dry to sustain rain fed, field crop ecosystems.  Human densities associated with nomadic pastoralism are low, much lower than in  shifting agriculture. This is largely due to two reasons <em>viz</em>., (a) low  and unpredictable primary production caused by low and highly erratic rainfall  and (b) dependence on secondary production by warm blooded herbivores. This  result is only a small proportion of the energy fixed in primary production  being available to humans, who are secondary consumers in this agro-ecosystem.  Pastoralism however allows conversion of low quality, inedible plant biomass <em>viz</em>.,  grass, to high quality foods <em>viz</em>., meat and milk, in regions which would  not support any people on the basis of crop production. <br />
				  In range grazing,  a high proportion of nutrients is recycled via plant residues since the  proportion of available herbage consumed by livestock or other herbivores is  low. The nutrient cycle is thus small in magnitude and highly dependent on  release of nutrients by organic matter decomposition. The rate of this process  is impeded by the lack of soil moisture over a large part of the year. The  practice of burning speeds up nutrient turnover but it also increases losses of  nitrogen. All nutrients are also subject to loss by runoff due to heavy  rainfall intensities during the short wet season. Nitrification is also very  slow. In nomadic pastoralism, manipulation of the environment is usually  limited to selection of grazing routes and watering sites. The environment is  manipulated to a greater extent where wells are provided to improve water  supplies for cattle and where fires are set off to improve the quality and  quantity of natural grazing.<br />
  <strong>Non-industrial and semi-industrial  continuous agriculture</strong> <br />
				  Eco-systems  created by humans and characterized by continuous field crop husbandry are  often termed <em>field crop ecosystems</em>. They are cultivated plant  communities which are managed to achieve goals such as the production of food  and other useful agricultural commodities; financial gain; and personal  satisfaction. Usually, they are managed to achieve a combination of these  goals. Field crop ecosystems fall into two main categories <em>viz</em>.,  non-industrial agriculture and industrial agriculture. Those in the former  category are largely self contained agro-ecosystems, while those in the latter category  are part of, and dependent upon, other elements within larger agro-ecosystems. Field  crop ecosystems differ from natural ecosystems in several plant and community  characteristics as well as in their functioning. These differences are  summarized below <br />

				<p align="justify">Field crop  ecosystems may be categorized as monocultural systems when they are dominated  by a single crop species and as multi-crop systems when no single crop species  is dominant. There is a continuous gradient from high input monocultural  systems at one end of the spectrum to low input multi-crop system at the other.  Mixed farming systems, in which cropping and livestock subsystems are  integrated within a single agro-ecosystem, constitute  a special category of multi-cropping systems,  in which one or more of the crops grown are grazed or used as fodder. Besides  outputs in various forms such as meat and milk, the livestock subsystem also  provides the cropping subsystem with (a) fertilizer in the form of manure and  (b) a source of power for various operations such as soil tillage, weeding and  irrigation of crops, and transport and processing of crop harvests. Energy use  efficiency is however lowered where the agro-ecosystem includes a livestock  subsystem.<br />
                    <strong>Industrial Agriculture</strong> <br />
				  Industrial  agriculture is primarily distinguished by the substitution of fossil fuel  energy for human labour and animal power. Two persons may be employed per ha in  non-industrial continuous agriculture, whereas only 0.1 person may be needed  per ha in industrial agriculture. The fossil fuel energy subsidy is used to  produce agro-chemicals such as fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides; to  manufacture farm machinery; to operate this machinery in the performance of  work such as soil tillage, planting and harvesting of crops, and application of  fertilizers or pesticides and for irrigation and transport.<br />
				  Because  of the massive amounts of energy required to produce chemical fertilizers,  pesticides and weedicides on the one hand, and to manufacture and operate agricultural  machinery on the other; industrial agriculture is highly intensive in its use  of energy subsidies. The increased use of energy subsidies is associated with  increase in energy output per unit area and per man-hour, but the ratio of  energy output to energy input decreases. Efficiency of energy use in  semi-industrial and industrial agriculture is therefore considerably lower than  in non-industrial agriculture with efficiency decreasing sharply as the energy  subsidy increases.<br />
				  In  industrial agriculture, a primary objective is to maximize yields, and this is  achieved largely through increasing use of chemical fertilizers. A major  disadvantage of reliance on chemical fertilizers, apart from their cost to  subsistence farmers, is their role in further depleting the already low organic  matter content of tropical soils.                Control  of pests and pathogens in industrial agriculture relies heavily on the use of  chemical pesticides. Pesticide use has however created almost as many problems  as it was designed to solve.<br />
				  Industrial  agriculture displays many of the characteristics of manufacturing industry such  as high capital expenditure on buildings and machinery; specialization of  production; and large outputs of wastes which are not recycled within the  system. Wastes from industrial agriculture, such as chemicals leached in  drainage, are significant pollutants of other ecosystems. The most harmful  effects of industrial agriculture on the environment are however due to soil  tillage and undue exposure of bare soil, resulting in accelerated soil erosion  and consequent depletion of the soil resource base. </p>
