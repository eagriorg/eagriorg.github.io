The community  has joint agricultural and scientific programmes. It has programmes of framing  and implementation of coordinated policy for environmental improvement and conservation  of natural resources. CPCB, India has taken up projects on air quality  monitoring with assistance of EEC.<br />
                  <strong>5. Human Exposure Assessment Location (HEAL). </strong>The  project is a part of the Health Related Monitoring Programme by WHO in  co-operation with UNEP. This project has three components, viz., (i) air  monitoring (ii) water quality monitoring and (iii) food contamination  monitoring on a global basis. <br />
                  <strong>6. International Council of Scientific Unions  (ICSU). </strong>A non-government organization based in Paris, that encourages the  exchange of scientific information, initiates programmes requiring  international scientific cooperation and studies and reports on matters related  to social and political responsibilities in treatment of scientific community.<br />
                  <strong>7. International Union for Conservation of Nature  and Natural Resources (IUCN). </strong>An autonomous body, founded in 1948 with its  Headquarters at Morges, Switzerland, that initiates and promotes scientifically  based conservation measures. It also cooperates with United Nations and other  intergovernmental agencies and sister bodies of World Wide Fund for Nature  (WWF).<br />
  <strong>                8. International Marine Consultative organization  (IMCO)</strong>. It  regulates the operation of ship in high seas, from marine water pollution  viewpoint.<br />
  <strong>                9. South Asia co-operative Environment Programme  (SACEP).</strong> This has been recently set up for exchange of professional knowledge and  expertise on environmental issues among member countries – Afghanistan,  Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Iran, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.<br />
  <strong>                10. United Nations Educational, Scientific and  Cultural Organization (UNESCO). </strong>An United Nations agency, found in 1945 to support and  implement the efforts of member states to promote education, scientific  research and information, and the arts to develop the cultural aspects of world  relations. It also holds conferences and seminars, promotes research and  exchange of information and provides technical support. Its Headquarters are in  Paris. Independently as well as in collaboration with other agencies like UNEP,  it supports activities related to environmental quality, human settlements,  training to environmental engineers and other socio-cultural programmes related  to environment.<br />
  <strong>                11. United Nations Environment programme (UNEP). </strong>A UN agency, responsible for  co-operation of inter-governmental measures for environmental monitoring and  protection. It was set up in 1972. There is a voluntary United Nations  Environment Fund to finance environmental projects. There is an Environmental  Coordination Board, to coordinate the UNEP programmes. Its Headquarters are in  Nairobi, Kenya. UNEP was founded to study and formulate international  guidelines for management of the environment. UNEP is assisting many such  programmes in India.<br />
                  <strong>12. World Commission on environment and  Development (WCED). </strong>This is a 23 member commission, set up in 1984 in  pursuance to a UN General Assembly resolution in 1983 to re-examine the  critical environmental and development issues and to formulate proposals for  them. This is a call for political action to manage better environmental  resources to ensure human progress and survival. The commission makes an  assessment of the level of understanding and commitment of individuals,  voluntary organizations and governmental bodies on environmental issues.<br />
  <strong>                13. Earthwatch Programme</strong>. A world wide programme, established  in 1972 under the terms of the Declaration on the Human Environment. It  monitors trends in the environment, based on a series of monitoring stations.  Its activities are coordinated by UNEP.<br />
  <strong>                14. Project Earth. </strong>Developed in collaboration with UNEP  to inspire and educate young people worldwide on the crucial issues facing the  Earth's Environment. <br />
  <strong>                15. Man and Biosphere Programme (MAB)</strong>.The programme is the  outcome of International Biological Programme (IBP) that has already concluded  its activities. MAB was formerly launched by UNESCO in 1971. <br />
  <strong>Man and the Biosphere  Programme (MAB)</strong><br />
                  MAB is the outcome of the experience of those  involved in the International Biological Programme (IBP). It was realized that  several problems require collaboration of natural and social scientists,  planners and managers and the local people. MAB was conceived at the  International Biosphere Conference of UNESCO in 1968 and was officially given  shape by General Conference at its 16th Session in 1970. The  programme was formally launched by UNESCO in November 1971, when the MAB  International Coordinating Council held its first session and identified 13  project areas of cooperative research. One more project area was added in 1974.<br />
  <strong>National Organizations</strong><br />
                  There are a number of governmental as well as  non-governmental organizations, agencies and programmes engaged in  environmental studies. A number of non-governmental, voluntary organizations  have been doing good job in this area.<br />
                  Most of the governmental bodies involved in  environmental studies are either put under the administrative control of, or  assisted by the Department of Environment, Forests and Wildlife in the Ministry  of Environment Forests, Government of India.    <strong></strong><br />
  <strong>Department of Environment,  Forests and Wildlife of India</strong><br />
                  Department of Environment was set up in 1980 to serve  as the local point in the administrative structure of the Government for  planning, promotion and coordination of environmental programmes. <br />
                  The present integrated Department of Environment,  Forests and Wildlife in the Ministry of Environment and Forests was created in  September 1985. The Ministry serves as the local point in the administrative  structure of the Central Government of the planning, promotion and coordination  of environmental and forestry programmes. The Ministry's main activities are,  the survey and conservation of flora, forests and wildlife, prevention and  control of pollution, afforestation and regeneration of the degraded areas of  the environment.<br />
  <strong>Other National Organization</strong><br />
                  There are other governmental and non-governmental  organizations / agencies involved in environmental issues. Some of the  important ones are as follows:<br />

  <strong>Environmental Impact Assessment</strong>         <br />
                  Environmental  impact assessment is a written analysis or process that describes and details  the probable and possible effects of planned industrial or civil project  activities on the ecosystem, resources, and environment. The National  Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) first promulgated guidelines for environmental  impact assessments with the intention that the environment receives proper  emphasis among social, economic, and political priorities in governmental  decision-making. This act explains the importance of environmental impact  assessments for major federal actions affecting the environment. Many states  now have similar requirements for state and private activities. Such written  assessments are called Environmental Impact Statements or EISs.<br />
  <strong>Environmental Impact  Statement</strong> (EIS) is a formal process used to predict how a development project or proposed  legislation will affect such natural resources as water, air, land, and  wildlife. The environmental impact statement was first introduced in 1969 in  the United States as a requirement of the National Environmental Policy Act.  Since then, an increasing number of countries have adopted the process,  introducing legislation and establishing agencies with responsibility for its  implementation.<a href="lec16.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1"> </a><br />
                  EISs range from brief statements to extremely  detailed multi-volume reports that require many years of data collection and  analysis. In general, the environmental impact assessment process requires  consideration and evaluation of the proposed project, its impacts, alternatives  to the project, and mitigating strategies designed to reduce the severity of  adverse effects. The assessments are completed by multidisciplinary teams in government  agencies and consulting firms.<br />
                  The content of the assessments generally follows  guidelines in the National Environmental Policy Act. Assessments usually  include the following sections:<br />
                  1)            Background  information describing the affected population and the environmental setting,  including archaeological and historical features, public utilities, cultural  and social values, topography, hydrology, geology and soil, climatology,  natural resources, and terrestrial and aquatic communities ;<br />
                  2)            Description  of the proposed action detailing its purpose, location, time frame, and  relationship to other projects;<br />
                  3)            The  environmental impacts of proposed action on natural resources, ecological  systems, population density, distribution and growth rate, land use, and human  health. These impacts should be described in detail and include primary and  secondary impacts, beneficial and adverse impacts, short and long term effects,  the rate of recovery, and importantly, measures to reduce or eliminate adverse  effects;<br />
                  4)            Adverse  impacts that cannot be avoided are described in detail, including a description  of their magnitude and implications;<br />
                  5)            Alternatives  to the project are described and evaluated. These must include the &quot;no  action&quot; alternative. A comparative analysis of alternative permits the  assessment of environmental benefits, risks, financial benefits and costs, and  overall effectiveness;<br />
                  6)            The  reason for selecting the proposed action is justified as a balance between  risks, impacts, costs, and other factors relevant to the project;<br />
                  7)            The  relationship between short and long term uses and maintenance is described,  with the intent of detailing short and long term gains and losses;<br />
                  8)            Reversible  and irreversible impacts;<br />
                  9)            Public  participation in the process is described;<br />
                  10)          Finally,  the EIS includes a discussion of problems and issues raised by interested  parties, such as specific federal, state, or local agencies, citizens, and  activists.<br />
                  The environmental impact assessment process provides  a wealth of detailed technical information. It has been effective in stopping,  altering, or improving some projects. However, serious questions have been  raised about the adequacy and fairness of the process. For example, assessments  may be too narrow or may not have sufficient depth. The alternatives considered  may reflect the judgment of decision makers who specify objectives, the study  design, and the alternatives considered. Difficult and important questions  exist regarding the balance of environmental, economic, and other interests.  Finally these issues often take place in a politicized and highly charged  atmosphere that may not be amenable to negotiation. Despite these and other  limitations, environmental impact assessments help to provide a systematic  approach to sharing information that can improve public decision-making.<br />
  <strong>Environmental Laws And  Regulation</strong><br />
                  Man has drawn so much from  nature for the satisfaction of his   needs,  desires and ambitions  resulting in the immediate need for proper environmental management. The proper  environmental management requires that society and man’s demands should be so  regulated that natural environment is able to sustain the need for development.  The question of environmental protection would essentially be a question of  re-allocation of priorities among various needs and choosing among diverse  means for meeting them. The environmental protection is the concern of  everyone. The fundamental question before the world today is whether we can  allow the destruction of the environment leading to the destruction of all life  on the earth. Hence protection of environment is of paramount importance.<br />
  <strong>Environmental  laws</strong><br />
                  Major  legislations directly dealing with the protection of environment in India are <br />
                  1.    The wild life protection Act,  1972.<br />
                  2.    The forest conservation Act,  1980.<br />
                  3.    The water (Prevention and  control of pollution) Act, 1974.<br />
                  4.    The air (Prevention and  control of pollution) Act, 1981. <br />
                  5.    The Environment (Protection)  Act, 1986.<br />
                  6.    The Public Liability  Insurance Act, 1991.<br />
                  7.    The National Environment  Tribunal Act, 1995. <br />
                  The wild life protection Act, 1972 provides for rational  and modern wildlife management, while the forest protection Act, 1980 has been  enacted to check indiscriminate deforestation and diversion of forest land for  non-forest purposes. The water and air Acts are the major instruments for the  control of water and air pollution and these have provided for the  establishment of the Central and State Pollution Control Boards. </p>
                <h1 align="justify">Environmental protection under Indian  constitution</h1>
                <p align="justify">The 42nd Amendment  to the constitution brought about in the year 1974 inserted two new Articles  namely. <br />
                  (I)  Art. 48-A  under Directive principles of State Policy, making it the responsibility of the  State Government to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the  forests and wildlife of the country. <br />
                  (II)  Art. 51-A (g)  under Fundamental duties of citizens; making it the fundamental duty of every  citizen to protect and improve the natural environment including forests,  lakes, rivers and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures. <br />
                  The Environment (Protection)  act, (EPA) 1986 is a landmark legislation which provides for a single focus in  the country for the protection of environment and aims at plugging the  loopholes in the existing legislation. It is a comprehensive legislation to  deal with water, air and land pollution and hazardous wastes and handling,  storage and transportation of hazardous chemicals and wastes. </p>

                  (f)           Procedures and safeguards for the  prevention of accidents which may cause environmental pollution and for  providing  remedial measures for such  accidents. <br />
  <strong>The  Public liability Insurance Act, 1991</strong>, provides mandatory insurance for the  purpose of providing immediate relief to the persons affected by accidents  occurring while handling any hazardous substance. <br />
  <strong>The  National Environmental Tribunal Act, 1995,</strong> seeks to constitute a tribunal with  Benches to award compensation for damage to persons, property and the  environment arising out of any activity involving hazardous substances. All  these Acts are amended from time to time to rationalize and expand their scope,  coverage and penal provisions.<br />
  <strong>Environmental Education</strong><br />
  <strong>Environmental education</strong> (&quot;EE&quot;) refers to organized efforts  to teach about how natural environments function and, particularly, how human  beings can manage their behavior and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystems</a> in order to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_living" title="Sustainable living">live  sustainably</a>. The term is often used to imply education  within the school system, from primary to post-secondary. However, it is  sometimes used more broadly to include all efforts to educate the public and  other audiences, including print materials, websites, media campaigns, etc.  Related disciplines include outdoor education and experiential education. The  United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Environment_Program" title="United Nations Environment Program">United Nations Environment Program</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNEP" title="UNEP">UNEP</a>) created three major  declarations that have guided the course of environmental education.</p>
                <h3 align="justify"><a name="Stockholm_Declaration" id="Stockholm_Declaration"></a>Stockholm  Declaration </h3>
                <p align="justify">June 5-16, 1972 - The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Declaration_of_the_United_Nations_Conference_on_Human_Environment&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Declaration of the United Nations Conference on Human Environment (page does not exist)">Declaration  of the United Nations Conference on Human Environment</a>. The document was made up  of 7 proclamations and 26 principles &quot;to inspire and guide the peoples of  the world in the preservation and enhancement of the human environment.</p>
                <h3 align="justify"><a name="The_Belgrade_Charter" id="The_Belgrade_Charter"></a>The Belgrade  Charter </h3>
                <p align="justify">October 13-22,  1975 - The  Belgrade Charter was the outcome of the International Workshop on Environmental  Education held in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The Belgrade Charter was built upon the  Stockholm Declaration and adds goals, objectives, and guiding principles of  environmental education programs. It defines an audience for environmental  education, which includes the general public.</p>
                <h3 align="justify"><a name="The_Tbilisi_Declaration" id="The_Tbilisi_Declaration"></a>The Tbilisi  Declaration </h3>
                <p align="justify">October 14-26, 1977 - The Tbilisi Declaration noted the unanimous accord  in the important role of environmental education in the preservation and  improvement of the world's environment, as well as in the sound and balanced  development of the world's communities. The Tbilisi Declaration updated and  clarified The Stockholm Declaration and The Belgrade Charter by including new goals,  objectives, characteristics, and guiding principles of environmental education.</p>
                <h2 align="justify"><a name="Antecedents" id="Antecedents"></a>Antecedents </h2>
                <p align="justify">In the United States some of the antecedents of Environmental Education  were Nature Studies, Conservation Education and School Camping. Nature studies  integrated academic approach with outdoor exploration. Conservation Education  brought awareness to the misuse of natural resources. The governmental agencies  like the Forestry Service and the EPA were also pushing a conservation agenda.  Conservation ideals still guide environmental education today. School Camping  was exposure to the environment and use of resources outside of the classroom  for educational purposes. The legacies of these antecedents are still present  in the evolving arena of environmental education.<br />
                    <a name="About" id="About"></a>Environmental education has been considered  an additional or elective subject in much of traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-12" title="K-12">K-12</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum" title="Curriculum">curriculum</a>. At the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_school" title="Elementary school">elementary  school</a> level, environmental education can take the  form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science" title="Science">science</a> enrichment curriculum, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history" title="Natural history">natural  history</a> field trips, community service projects, and  participation in outdoor science schools. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school" title="Secondary school">secondary  school</a>, environmental curriculum can be a focused  subject within the sciences or is a part of student interest groups or clubs.  At the undergraduate and graduate level, it can be considered its own field  within education, environmental studies, environmental science and policy,  ecology, or human/cultural ecology programs.<br />
                  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=North_American_Association_for_Environmental_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="North American Association for Environmental Education (page does not exist)">North  American Association for Environmental Education</a>  has established the following  &quot;Guidelines for Excellence&quot; for environmental education:<br />
                  1. Fairness and accuracy: EE materials should  be fair and accurate in describing environmental problems, issues, and  conditions, and in reflecting the diversity of perspectives on them. </p>
                <div align="justify">
                  <ul>
                    <li>Factual accuracy.</li>
                    <li>Balanced presentation of differing viewpoints and theories. </li>

                  </ul>
                </div>
                <p align="justify">2. Depth: EE materials  should foster an awareness of the natural and built environment, an  understanding of environmental concepts, conditions, and issues, and an  awareness of the feelings, values, attitudes, and perceptions at the heart of  environmental issues, as appropriate for different developmental levels.</p>
                <div align="justify">
                  <ul>
                    <li>Awareness</li>
                    <li>Focus on concepts</li>

                </div>
                <p align="justify">3. Emphasis on skills building: EE materials  should build lifelong skills that enable learners to address environmental issues.</p>
                <div align="justify">
                  <ul>

                </div>
                <p align="justify">4. Action orientation: EE materials should  promote civic responsibility, encouraging learners to use their knowledge,  personal skills, and assessments of environmental issues as a basis for  environmental problem solving and action. </p>
                <div align="justify">
                  <ul>
                    <li>Sense of personal stake and responsibility</li>

                </div>
                <p align="justify">6. Usability: EE materials  should be well designed and easy to use. </p>
                <div align="justify">

                <h2 align="justify"><a name="Related_disciplines" id="Related_disciplines"></a>Related disciplines </h2>
                <p align="justify">Environmental education has crossover with the disciplines of outdoor  education and experiential education. Both disciplines complement environmental  education yet have unique philosophies.</p>
                <div align="justify">
                  <ul type="disc">
                    <li>Outdoor education means learning &quot;in&quot; and       &quot;for&quot; the outdoors. It is a means of curriculum extension and       enrichment through outdoor experiences. Environmental education is often       taught or enhanced through outdoor experiences. The out of doors       experience while not strictly environmental in nature often contain       elements of teaching about the environment. </li>
                    <li>Experiential education is a process through which a learner       constructs knowledge, skill, and value from direct experiences.       Experiential education can be viewed as both a process and method to       deliver the ideas and skills associated with environmental education. </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <p align="justify">While each of these  disciplines have their own objectives, there are points where both disciplines  overlap with the intentions and philosophy of environmental education.</p>
                <h2 align="justify"><a name="Trends" id="Trends"></a>Trends </h2>
                <p align="justify">One of the current trends within environmental education seeks to move  from an approach of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology" title="Ideology">ideology</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activism" title="Activism">activism</a> to one that allows  students to make informed decisions and take action based on experience as well  as data. Within this process, environmental curricula have progressively been  integrated into governmental education standards. Some environmental educators  find this movement distressing and a move away from the original political and  activist approach to environmental education while others find this approach  more valid and accessible.</p>
                <h2 align="justify"><a name="Movement" id="Movement"></a>Movement </h2>
                <p align="justify">There is a movement that  has progressed since the relatively recent founding (1960s) of the idea of  environmental education in industrial societies, which has transported the  participant from nature appreciation and awareness to education for an  ecologically sustainable future. This trend may be viewed as a microcosm of how  many environmental education programs seek to first engage with participants  through developing a sense of nature appreciation which is then translated into  actions that affect conservation and sustainability.</p>
                <h1 align="justify">Clean Development Mechanism</h1>
                <p align="justify">The <strong>Clean Development Mechanism</strong> (<strong>CDM</strong>) is an arrangement  under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto  Protocol</a> allowing industrialized countries with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse  gas</a> reduction commitment (called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change#Annex_I_countries" title="United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change">Annex  1</a> countries) to invest in projects that reduce emissions in developing countries  as an alternative to more expensive emission reductions in their own countries.  A crucial feature of an approved CDM <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_project" title="Carbon project">carbon  project</a> is that it has established that the planned  reductions would not occur without the additional incentive provided by  emission reductions credits, a concept known as &quot;additionality&quot;.<br />
                  The CDM allows net global greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced at a  much lower global cost by financing emissions reduction projects in developing  countries where costs are lower than in industrialized countries. However, in  recent years, criticism against the mechanism has increased. Critics claim many  approved projects are not actually additional.<br />
                  The CDM is supervised by the CDM Executive Board (CDM EB) and is under  the guidance of the Conference of the Parties (COP/MOP) of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change" title="United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change">United  Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> (UNFCCC).<br />
                </p>
                <h2 align="justify"><a name="CDM_project_process" id="CDM_project_process"></a><a name="Outline_of_the_project_process" id="Outline_of_the_project_process"></a><a name="CDM_projects_to_date" id="CDM_projects_to_date"></a>CDM projects to date </h2>
                <p align="justify">As of 21 July 2008, 1128 projects have been registered by the CDM  Executive Board as CDM projects. These projects reduce green house gas  emissions by an estimated 220 million ton CO2 equivalent per year.  There are about 4,000 projects yet to be certified. These projects would reduce  CO2 emissions by over 2.5 billion tons until the end of 2012.  However, the previous adoption rate suggests that only a fraction of these  projects will be certified.</p>
