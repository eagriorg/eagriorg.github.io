  <strong>The Wildlife Protection Act ,  1972 </strong><br />
                  The Wildlife  Protection Act of 1972 refers to a sweeping package of legislation  enacted in 1972 by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India" title="Government of India">Government  of India</a>. Before 1972, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> only had five designated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_parks_of_India" title="National parks of India">national  parks</a>. Among other reforms, the Act established  schedules of protected plant and animal species; hunting or harvesting these  species was largely outlawed.<br />
                  The Act provides for the protection of wild animals,  birds and plants; and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or  incidental thereto. It extends to the whole of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>, except the State of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu" title="Jammu">Jammu</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir" title="Kashmir">Kashmir</a> which has its own wildlife act. It has six schedules  which give varying degrees of protection. <a href="http://envfor.nic.in/legis/wildlife/wildlife2s1.html">Schedule I</a> and part II of <a href="http://envfor.nic.in/legis/wildlife/wildlife2s2.html">Schedule II</a> provide absolute protection - offences under these are  prescribed the highest penalties. Species listed in <a href="http://envfor.nic.in/legis/wildlife/wildlife2s3.html">Schedule III</a> and <a href="http://envfor.nic.in/legis/wildlife/wildlife2s4.html">Schedule IV</a> are also protected, but the penalties are much lower. <a href="http://envfor.nic.in/legis/wildlife/wildlife2s5.html">Schedule V</a> includes the animals which may be hunted. The plants in <a href="http://envfor.nic.in/legis/wildlife/wildlife2s6.html">Schedule VI</a> are prohibited from cultivation and planting. The  hunting to the Enforcement authorities have the power to compound offences  under this Schedule (i.e. they impose fines on the offenders). Up to April 2010  there have been 16 convictions under this act relating to the death of tigers.<br />
                  Government of India enacted a comprehensive legislation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_Protection_Act_of_1972" title="Wildlife Protection Act of 1972">Wildlife  Protection Act of 1972</a> with the objective of  effectively controlling poaching and illegal trade in wildlife and its  derivatives. This has been amended (and signed) in January, 2003 and punishment  and penalty for offences under the Act have been made more stringent.<br />
  <strong>Offences pertaining to hunting of endangered species and  altering of boundaries of protected areas</strong><br />
                  For offences relating to wild animals (or their parts and  products) included in schedule-I or part II of Schedule- II and those relating  to hunting or altering the boundaries of a sanctuary or national park the  punishment and penalty have been enhanced, the minimum imprisonment prescribed  is three years which may extend to seven years, with a minimum fine of Rs.  10,000/-. For a subsequent offence of this nature, the term of imprisonment  shall not be less than three years but may extend to seven years with a minimum  fine of Rs. 25,000. Also a new section (51 - A) has been inserted in the Act,  making certain conditions applicable while granting bail: 'When any person  accused of the commission of any offence relating to Schedule I or Part II of  Schedule II or offences relating to hunting inside the boundaries of National  Park or Wildlife Sanctuary or altering the boundaries of such parks and  sanctuaries, is arrested under the provisions of the Act, then not withstanding  anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, no such person who  had been previously convicted of an offence under this Act shall be released on  bail unless -<br />
                  (a) The Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity  of opposing the release on bail; and<br />
                  (b)  Where the Public Prosecutor opposes the application, the Court is satisfied  that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such  offences and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail&quot;.<br />
                  In order to improve the intelligence gathering in  wildlife crime, the existing provision for rewarding the informers has been  increased from 20% of the fine and composition money respectively to 50% in  each case. In addition to this, a reward up to Rs. 10,000/- is also proposed to  be given to the informants and others who provide assistance in detection of  crime and apprehension of the offender.<br />
                  At present, persons having ownership certificate in  respect of Schedule I and Part II animals, can sell or gift such articles. This  has been amended with a view to curb illegal trade, and thus no person can now  acquire Schedule I or Part II of Schedule II animals, articles or trophies  except by way of inheritance (except live elephants).<br />
                  Stringent measures have also been proposed to forfeit the  properties of hardcore criminals who have already been convicted in the past  for heinous wildlife crimes. These provisions are similar to the provisions of  'Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985'. Provisions have also  been made empowering officials to evict encroachments from Protected Areas.<br />
  <strong>Forest ( Conservation ) Act,1980</strong><br />
                  Earlier the Indian Forest Act,  1927 was adopted to include reserved forests, village forests, protected  forests and non-Govt. forests. This act regulated the duty levied on timber and  other forest producers. But this act does not in to consideration about conservation  protection of forests. In addition this act does not consider or include the tribal  who were the most conservators and protectors of forest. Hence the forests  (conservation) Act, 1980 was adopted. This act has different sections to deal  with various concepts related to conservation of forests.<br />
                  1.  This  Act has the main aim to protect all types of forests.<br />
                  2.  Thus  indirectly help to maintain the ecosystem and biological diversity.<br />
                  3.  This  Act, stresses that the state government would be empowered to declare a reserve                          forests as  unreserved  and any forest land cannot be  used for non-forest  purpose i.e., any             purpose other than afforestation.<br />
                  4.  This  act further checks the operations that must be carried out in forests such as  mining which will cause ecological imbalance leading to environmental  deterioration.<br />
                  5.    According to this act the central government has the authority to  maintain an ecological balance in the forest extending from the tropical to  temperate regions.<br />
                  6.  This  act was enacted and strictly followed on the basis of the fact that forest is a  valuable treasure. Forest is defined as an ecosystem in which trees are  dominant form of vegetation, the plants, animals and the soil play an important  role.<br />
                  7.  This  act comprises of five important sections</p>
