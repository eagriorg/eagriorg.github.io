				<p align="justify">Environment is  derived from the French word Environner, which mean encircle or surrounding. Environment is a complex of many variables,  which surrounds man as well as the living organisms.  Environmental studies describe the interrelationships among organisms, the  environment and all the factors, which influence life on earth, including  atmospheric conditions, food chains, the water cycle, etc. It is a basic  science about our earth and its daily activities, and therefore, this science  is important for one and all.</p>

                  Man and nature have lived together and  as long as man’s wants were in conformity with nature, there was no problem.  But unfortunately, man’s ambition for limitless enjoyment and comfort has led  him towards the exploitation of nature’s wealth so indiscriminately as to  reduce nature’s capacity for self stabilization. The indiscriminate  exploitation of nature over centuries has created numerous environmental  problems. Man’s voracious appetite for resources and his desire to conquer  nature has put him on collision course with environment. The demands of his  explosive technological society impose intense stress on the state of  equilibrium with the environment. Major environmental issues threatening  mankind are Global warming, water pollution, pesticide pollution, Hazardous  waste, biomedical wastes, e waste, and loss of biodiversity<br />
                  India today is one of the first ten  industrialized countries of the world.   Today we have a good industrial infrastructure in core industries like  metals, chemicals, fertilizers, petroleum, food etc.  What has come out of these?, Pesticides,  detergents, plastics, solvents, paints, dyes, food additives etc.  Due to progress in atomic energy, there are  also been an increase in radioactivity in the biosphere.  Besides these there are a number of  industrial effluent and emissions particularly poisonous gases in the  atmosphere.  Mining activities also added  to this problem particularly as solid waste.<br />
                  Such activities of man had adverse effect on  all forms of living organisms in the biosphere.   The earth planet along with the atmosphere (air, land, water) that  sustains life is called the Biosphere.   Due to lack of development of a culture of pollution control, there has  resulted a heavy backlog of gaseous, liquid and solid pollution in our country.   The  solid wastes which causes pollution are Hazardous waste, pesticides, medical  waste etc. they are become the major environmental issues in addition to  automobile pollution, climate change, water pollution, pesticide pollution and biodiversity  loss in our country and worldwide.<br />
  </p>
                <p align="justify"><strong>Industrial  / Vehicular pollution</strong><br />
                  The coolest culprits of environmental  degradation in metropolitan cities are vehicular and industrial pollution.  Since 1975 the Indian economy has grown 2.5  times, the industrial pollution load has grown 3.47 times and the vehicular  pollution load 7.5 times, in Delhi, for example 70% of air pollution is caused  by vehicular pollution.  Thanks to the 3  million vehicles on its roads-while industries account for 17%.  The pollutants emitted by the vehicles could  produce inflammatory effects on the respiratory organs, could be toxic or even  carcinogenic depending upon the fuel type, In India, vehicles primarily run on  diesel or petrol.</p>

                <p align="justify"><strong>Climate  Change</strong><br />
                The rising concentrations of greenhouse gases  (GHGs) of anthropogenic origin in the atmosphere such as carbon dioxide (CO2),  methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) have increased,  since the late 19th century. According to the Third Assessment Report (TAR) of  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, because of the increase in  concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (for e.g., CO2  by 29 per cent, CH4 by 150 per cent and N2O by 15 per  cent) in the last 100 years, the mean surface temperature has risen by  0.4–0.8°C globally. The precipitation has become spatially variable and the  intensity and frequency of extreme events has increased. The sea level also has  risen at an average annual rate of 1–2 mm during this period. The continued  increase in concentration of GHG in the atmosphere is likely to lead to climate  change resulting in large changes in ecosystems, leading to possible  catastrophic disruptions of livelihoods, economic activity, living conditions,  and human health. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  requires the parties to protect the climate system in accordance with their  ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’ and respective capabilities. In  the year 1990, the developed world (Australia, Canada, USA, Europe, former USSR  and Japan) emitted around 66 per cent of the total global GHG emissions, which  though has reduced to 54 per cent in 2000, mainly offset by the rise in Chinese  emissions. The South Asian region, including three-fourths emission share of  India, contributed only 3 per cent of the total global GHG emissions in 1990  and the share of emissions from South Asia has grown merely by 4 per cent in  2000. </p>

                  India has 12  major rivers with a total catchments area of 252.8 million hectare. The Indian  homes produce about 75 % of the wastewater, and sewage treatment facilities are  inadequate in most cities and almost absent in rural India. According to the  Central pollution Control Board, of the 8,432 large and medium industries in  the country, only 4,989 had installed appropriate measures to treat wastewater  before discharge. Of the over two million small scale industrial units, a  number of which like tanneries are extremely polluting, very few have any  treatment facilities whatsoever and their untreated wastes invariably find  their way into country’s water systems.</p>

                </strong>Poisoning from pesticides affects 68,000  farmers and workers every day; annually, an estimated 25 million workers suffer  from pesticide poisoning throughout the world.   Farmers and agricultural workers are exposed to pesticides directly when  they are mixing and spraying these pesticides, especially so in developing  countries such as Asia. Every year, about 3 million people are poisoned around  the world and 200,000 die from pesticide use.  </p>

A laboratory report  prepared by CSE in 2003 detailed some astonishing facts about the extent of  pesticide contamination in soft drinks sold in India. CSE found high levels of  toxic pesticides and insecticides, high enough to cause cancer, damage to the  nervous and reproductive systems, birth defects and severe disruption of the immune  system. Market leaders Coca-Cola and Pepsi had almost similar concentrations of  pesticide residues. At the same time CSE also tested two soft drink brands sold  in the US, to see if they contained pesticides. They didn’t. This only goes to  show the companies were following dual standards.</p>

Implementation of the ban on the  ground is very negligent and hazardous waste is coming to our shores in regular  phenomenon. Apart-from generating their own hazardous wastes, India invites  import to such waste in the name of reuse and recycling, though there is lack  of environmental friendly technology to reuse and recycle hazardous waste.<br />
Thus indiscriminate generations, improper  handling, storage and disposal of hazardous waste are the main factors  contributing to the environmental and human health impact. The pressing need is  to rethink the present approach of pollution control and end-of-the-pipe  approaches and focus on pollution prevention, waste minimization, cleaner  production and toxics reduction.</p>

                  The continuous loss of  biodiversity due to over exploitation, habitat degradation, deforestation and  land pollution has posed serious threat to the very existence of the mankind.  It has been calculated that if this trend of biodepletion continues, about 1/4th  of the world species may be extinct by the year 2050. The rate of destruction  which has been of the order of one species per year over the past 600 million  years is today feared to be dozens of species a day. Hence, the conservation of  biodiversity has become one of the most pressing environmental issues. The  challenge is for nations, government agencies, organizations and individuals to  protect and enhance biological diversity, while continuing to meet people’s  need for natural resources.              <br />
                We are at a major  turning point in human history and for the first time, we now have the  resources, motivation, and knowledge to protect our environment and to build a  sustainable future for ourselves and our children.  Until recently, we didn’t have these  opportunities, or there was not enough clear evidence to inspire people to  change their behavior and invest in environmental protection; now the need is obvious  to nearly everyone. Unfortunately, this also may be the last opportunity to act  before our problems become irreversible.</p>
