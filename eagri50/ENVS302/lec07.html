				<p align="justify">India today is one of the  first ten industrialized countries of the world. Today we have a good  industrial infrastructure in core industries like metals, chemicals,  fertilizers, petroleum, food etc. what has come out of these? Pesticides,  detergents, plastics, solvents, fuels, paints, dyes, food additives etc. are  some examples. Due to progress in atomic energy, there has also been an  increase in radioactivity in the biosphere. Besides these, there are a number  of industrial effluents and emissions particularly poisonous gases in the  atmosphere. Mining activities also added to this problem particularly as solid  waste.<br />
				  Thus,  pollution is a necessary evil of all development. Due to lack of development of  a culture of pollution control, there had resulted a heavy backlog of gaseous,  liquid and solid pollution in our country. It is to be cleaned. Thus pollution  control in our country is a recent environmental concern.<br />
				  <strong>What is pollution ?</strong> Pollution is an  undesirable change in the physical, chemical or biological characteristics of  air, water and soil that may harmfully affect the life or create a potential  health hazard of any living organism. Pollution is thus direct or indirect  changes in any component of the biosphere that is harmful to the living  component(s), and in particular undesirable for man, affecting adversely the  industrial progress, cultural and natural assets or general environment.<br />
				  <strong>What are pollutants?</strong> Any substance which  causes pollution is called a pollutant. A pollutant may thus include any  chemical or geochemical (dust, sediment, grit etc.) substance, biotic component  or its product, or physical factor (heat) that is released intentionally by man  into the environment in such a concentration that may have adverse harmful or  unpleasant effects.<br />
  <strong>Environmental  Pollutants</strong><br />
				  The  various principal pollutants which pollute our air, water, land are as follows  :</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Deposited  matter – soot, smoke, tar, dust, grit etc.</li>
				    <li>Gases – Oxides of nitrogen (NO,  NO2), sulphur (SO2), carbon monoxide, halogens,  (chlorine, bromine, iodine),</li>
				    <li>Acids droplets – sulphruric,  acid nitric acid etc.</li>
				    <li>Fluorides</li>
				    <li>Metals – Mercury, lead, iron,  zinc, nickel, tin, cadmium, chromium etc.</li>
				    <li>Agrochemicals – Biocides (pesticides,  herbicides, fungicides, nematicides, bactericides, weedicides etc), and  fertilizers.</li>
				    <li>Complex organic substances –  Benzene, ether, acetic acid, benzopyrenes etc.</li>
				    <li>Photochemical oxidants –  Photochemical smog, ozone, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), peroxybenzoil nitrate  (PBzN), nitrogen oxides, aldehydes, ethylene etc.</li>
				    <li>Solid wastes</li>
				    <li>Radioactive waste</li>
				    <li>Noise </li>
			      </ul>
</div>
				<p align="justify"><strong> </strong><br />
                    <strong>Kinds  of Pollution</strong><br />
				  Various  types of pollutions are classified in different ways. On the basis of the type  of environment being polluted, we may recognize air pollution, water pollution,  land soil pollution, marine pollution etc. on the basis of the kind of  pollutant involved, we may have sulphur dioxide pollution, fluoride pollution,  carbon monoxide pollution, smoke pollution, lead pollution, mercury pollution,  solid waste pollution, radioactive pollution, noise pollution etc. Of the  variety of pollutants, we recognize the following two basic types of  pollutants: non degradable and biodegradable.<br />
  <strong>(1)  Nondegradable pollutants</strong><br />
				  These  are the materials and poisonous substances like aluminium cans, mercuric salts,  long-chain phenolics, DDT etc. that either do not degrade or degrade only very  slowly in nature. They are not cycled in ecosystem naturally but by subsequent  movement in food chains and biogeochemical cycles.<br />
  <strong>(2)  Biodegradable pollutants </strong><br />
				  They  are the domestic wastes that can be rapidly decomposed under natural condition.  They may create problems when they accumulate (i.e. their input into the  environment exceeds their decomposition).<br />
  <strong>Atmosphere</strong><br />
				  The earth’s vertically  extended atmosphere, an envelope of gases is divided into the following layers  : (i) troposphere (up to 5 km) – the lowest atmosphere in which temperature  decreases with height bounded by land or sea surface below and by tropopause  above, (ii) stratosphere (5 to 45 km) -   the region above the troposphere, in which temperature increases up to  900C with height. This is limited by stratopause, (iii) mesosphere  (45 to 80 km) – the part between stratosphere and thermosphere (ionosphere).  Temperature again decreases up to – 800C. (iv) thermosphere  (ionosphere) – above 80 km, the upper part in which temperature increases with  height. There is no boundary between the atmosphere and void of outer space.  About 75% of the earth’s atmosphere lies within 16 km. of the surface and 99%  of the atmosphere lies below an altitude of 30 km.<br />
				  The  atmosphere is an insulating blanket around the earth. It is source of essential  gases, maintains a narrow difference of day and night temperatures and provides  a medium for long-distance radio communication. It also acts as shield around  the earth against lethal UV radiations and meteors. Without atmosphere, there  will be no lightening, no wind, no clouds, no rains, no snow and no fire. <br />
				  Normal  composition of clean air at or near sea (1990) is as follows:<br />
				  <strong>Gases                                                            Percent  (by Volume)</strong><br />
				  Nitrogen                                                      78.084<br />
				  Oxygen                                                        20.9476<br />
				  Argon                                                            0.934<br />
				  Carbon  dioxide                                         0.0314<br />
				  Methane                                                     0.0002<br />
				  Hydrogen                                                    0.00005<br />
				  Other gases                                                minute<br />
				  <br />
				  Air is necessary for the  survival of all higher forms of life on Earth.   On an average, a person needs at least 30 lb of air every day to live,  but only about 3 lb of water and 1.5 lb of food.  A person can live about 5 weeks without food  and about 5 days without water, but only 5 minutes without air.  Naturally, every one likes to breathe fresh,  clean air.  But the atmosphere, that  invisible yet essential Ocean of different gases called air, is as susceptible  to pollution from human activities as are water and land environments. <br />
  <strong>Air  Pollution</strong><br />
				  It is defined as the excessive concentration  of foreign material in the atmosphere , which affects the health of individuals  and also causes damage to the property.<br />
  <strong>Air  pollution episodes</strong></p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong><em>London smog</em></strong> : SO2 à H2SO3 vapours  in the atmosphere. When automobile exhausts are trapped by this smog and  exposed to sunlight, it produces photochemical smog.</li>
				    <li><strong><em>Bhopal gas tragedy</em> :</strong> The poisonous gas, methyl isocyanate  (MTC) leakage in the pesticide manufacturing plant of Union Carbide of India  Ltd., (UCIL), Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh on December 3, 1984. 46 tons of MIC was  released spreading to 40 km. <em>Effects</em> : About 65,000 people suffered from various disorders in eyes, lungs, stomach,  heart, etc. The immediate symptom is bronchospasm which causes coughing, chest  pain and abdominal pain. Nearly 3000 people died within a short span of time,  1600 domestic animals died and  crop yields were reduced .</li>
				    <li><strong>Darkening effect of Taj  Mahal </strong><strong> </strong></li>
			      </ul>
</div>
				<p align="justify">        Taj Mahal is a white marble stone mausoleum.  Recently it was observed that the walls of Taj  Mahal has become darkened and disfigured due to air pollution from nearby  Mathura Oil refinery.<br />
				  H2O + SO2 à H2SO3 ,    SO2  + O2 à SO3; SO3 + H2O à H2SO4.  <br />
				  The acid rain reacts with  marble stone (CaCO3) to produce calcium sulphate, causing darkening  and disfigurement.<br />
  <strong>Types,  sources and effects of air pollution</strong><br />
				  Air  pollution may be simply defined as the presence of certain substances in the  air in high enough concentrations and for long enough duration to cause undesirable  effects.  “Certain substances” may be any  gas, liquid or solid, although certain specific substances are considered  significant pollutants because of very large emission rates are harmful and  unwanted effects.  “Long enough  durations” can be anywhere from a few hours to several days or weeks; on a  global scale, durations of months and years are of concern. <br />
  <strong>Sources</strong><br />
				  Air pollution results from  gaseous emission from mainly industry, thermal power stations, automobiles,  domestic combustion etc.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ol start="1" type="1">
				    <li><strong>Industrial chimney wastes</strong>: There       are a number of industries which are source of air pollution. Petroleum       refineries are the major source of gaseous pollutants. The chief gases are       SO2 and NOx. Cement factories emit plenty of dust,       which is potential health hazard. Stone crushers and hot mix plants also       create a menace. Food and fertilizers industries which emit gaseous       pollutants. Chemical manufacturing industries which emit acid vapours in       air. </li>
				    <li><strong>Thermal power stations:</strong>  There are a number of thermal power stations       and super thermal power stations in the country. The National thermal  power corporation (NTPC) is setting up       four mammoth coal-powered power stations to augment the energy generation.       These are at Singrauli in U.P., Korba in M.P., Ramagundam in Andhra       Pradesh and Farakka in W. Bengal. The coal consumption of thermal plants       is several million tones. The chief pollutants are fly ash, SO 2       and other gases and hydrocarbons.</li>
				    <li><strong>Automobiles</strong>: The toxic vehicular       exhausts are a source of considerable air pollution, next only to thermal       power plants. The ever increasing vehicular traffic density posed       continued threat to the ambient air quality. Chief sources of emission in       automobiles are (i) exhaust system, (ii) fuel tank and carburettor and       (iii) crankcase. The exhaust produces many air pollutants including       unburnt  hydrocarbons, CO, NOx       and lead oxides. There are also traces of aldehydes, esters, ethers,       peroxides and ketones which are chemically active and combine to form smog       in presence of light. Evaporation from fuel tank goes on constantly due to       volatile nature of petrol, causing emission of hydrocarbons. The       evaporation through carburettor occurs when engine is stopped and heat       builds up, and as much as 12 to 40 ml of fuel is lost during each long stop       causing emission of hydrocarbons.</li>
			      </ol>
</div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Criteria  Air Pollutants</strong><br />
				  The five primary criteria  pollutants include the gases- Carbon Monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx)  , sulfur dioxide (SO2), and solid or liquid particulates (smaller  than 10 µm), and particulate lead. <br />
  <strong>a) Carbon  Monoxide</strong></p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>CO is a colourless, odourless  and tasteless gas.</li>
				    <li>It is produced when  carbonaceous fuels are burned under less than ideal conditions.</li>
				    <li>Incomplete combustion, yielding  CO instead of CO2, results when any of the following variables are  not kept sufficiently high:</li>
				    <li>Oxygen supply</li>
				    <li>flame temperature</li>
				    <li>gas residence time at high  temperature and</li>
				    <li>combustion  chamber turbulence.</li>
				    <li>Most of the CO emissions are  from the transportation sector. Hourly atmospheric concentrations of CO often  reflect city driving patterns. Peaks occur on week days during the morning and  late afternoon rush hours.</li>
				    <li>The CO, at levels that occur in  urban air has no detrimental effect on materials or plants; but adversely  affects human health.</li>
				    <li>CO interferes with the blood's  ability to carry oxygen to the cells of the body. When inhaled, it readily binds to hemoglobin in the blood stream to form  carboxyhemoglobin (COHb).</li>
				    <li>Even small amounts of CO can seriously  reduce the amount of oxygen conveyed throughout the body à brain function is affected and heart rate increased in an attempt  to offset the oxygen deficit.</li>
			      </ul>
</div>
				<p align="justify"> b). Oxides Of Nitrogen</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>7 oxides of nitrogen are known  to occur – NO, NO2, NO3, N2O, N2O3,  N2O4 and N2O5.</li>
				    <li>Nitric oxide (NO) and Nitrogen  dioxide (NO2) are important in air pollution study.</li>
				    <li>There are two sources of  nitrogen oxides (or NOx):</li>
				    <li><em>Thermal NOx</em> are created when nitrogen and oxygen  in the combustion air are heated to a high enough temperature (&gt; 1000 K) to  oxidise nitrogen.</li>
				    <li><em>Fuel NOx</em> result from the  oxidation of nitrogen compounds that are chemically bound in the fuel molecules  themselves. Natural gas almost has no nitrogen in them and some coal can have  3% N by weight. Fuel NOx is often the dominant source of NOx.</li>
				    <li>Almost all NOx  emissions are in the form of NO, which has no adverse health effects.</li>
				    <li>However, NO can oxidise to NO2,  which in turn may react with hydrocarbons in the presence of sunlight to form  photochemical smog, which is injurious.</li>
				    <li>NO2 also reacts with  hydroxyl radical (HO) in the atmosphere to form nitric acid (HNO3)  and results in acid rain.</li>
				    <li>NO2 is an acute  irritant at higher concentrations. Prolonged exposure to relatively low  concentrations is linked to increased bronchitis in children. It can also  damage plants. When converted to nitric acid it causes corrosion of metal  surfaces.</li>
				    <li>NO is a colourless gas, but NO2  gives smog its reddish brown colour.</li>
				    <li>Reductions in NOx  emissions have been harder to achieve. </li>
				    <li>When mobile source controls are  introduced, modifications to the combustion process that improve emissions of  CO tend to make the NOx problem worse and vice-versa. To control CO,  it helps to increase the combustion air supply and to raise the temperature. To  control NOx, the opposite is true.</li>
			      </ul>
</div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>The  NO-NO2–O3 photochemical reaction sequence</strong></p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>NO is formed during combustion<strong></strong></li>
			      </ul>
</div>
				<p align="justify">                        N2 + O2 à 2 NO</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>The nitric oxide thus emitted,  can oxidise to NO2.</li>
			      </ul>
</div>
				<p align="justify">                        2 NO + O2 à 2 NO2.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>If sunlight is available, NO2  can photolyse, and the freed atomic oxygen can then help to form ozone:</li>
			      </ul>
</div>
				<p align="justify">                        NO2 + hvà NO + O<br />
				  O + O2 + M à O3 + M<br />
				  where hv represents a photon (l &lt;  0.38 µm) and M represents a molecule (usually O2 or N2) whose  presence is necessary to absorb excess energy from the reaction.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Ozone can then convert NO back  to NO2 :</li>
			      </ul>
</div>
				<p align="justify">                        O3 + NO à NO2 + O2</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Thus, NO concentrations rise as  early morning traffic emits its load of NO. Then as morning progresses, there  is a drop in NO and a rise in NO2 as NO gets converted to NO2.  As the sun's intensity increases toward noon, the rate of photolysis of NO2  increases; thus NO2 begins to drop while O3 rises. Ozone  is so effective in its reaction with NO that as long as O3 is  present, NO concentrations do not rise through the rest of the afternoon, even  though there may be new emissions.</li>
			      </ul>
</div>
				<p align="justify">If only NO2 photolytic cycle is  involved, O3 can not accumulate in sufficient quantity in  photochemical smog to account for the actual measured data. The introduction of  hydrocarbons upsets the balance in production and destruction of ozone, thus  allowing more O3 to accumulate.<strong> </strong><br />
                    <strong>Photochemical  smog and ozone</strong></p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>When oxides of nitrogen,  various hydrocarbons and sunlight come together, they initiate a complex set of  reactions that produce a number of secondary pollutants known as photochemical  oxidants.</li>
				    <li>Ozone (O3) is the  most abundant photochemical oxidant responsible for chest constriction and  irritation of the mucous membrane in people, cracking of rubber products and  damage to vegetation.</li>
				    <li>Other components of the  photochemical smog viz., formaldehyde, peroxy benzoyl nitrate (PBzN), peroxy  acetyl nitrate (PAN) and acrolein cause eye irritation.</li>
				    <li>The formation of photochemical  smog can be expressed in the simples terms as : Hydrocarbons + NOx +  sunlight à photochemical smog.</li>
			      </ul>
</div>
				<h5 align="justify">C).  Oxides of sulfur</h5>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Over 80% of anthropogenic  sulfur oxide emissions are the result of fossil fuel combustion in stationary  sources. Of that, almost 85% is released from electric utility power plants.  Only about 2% comes from highway vehicles.</li>
				    <li>The only significant non  combustion sources of Sulfur emissions are associated with petroleum refining,  copper smelting and cement manufacture.</li>
				    <li>Oil and coal generally contain  appreciable quantities of sulfur (0.5-6%), either in the form of inorganic  sulfides or as organic sulfur. When these fuels are burned, the sulfur is  released mostly as sulfur dioxide (SO2), but also with small amounts  of sulfur trioxides (SO3).</li>
				    <li>SO2, once released,  can convert to SO3 in a series of reactions which, once again,  involve a free radical such as OH<strong>.</strong></li>
			      </ul>
</div>
				<p align="justify"> SO2 + OH<strong>.</strong>                                            HO  SO2<strong>.</strong><br />
				  HO SO2<strong>.</strong> + O2                                         SO3 + HO2<strong>.</strong></p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>The HO2 radical can  then react with NO to return the initial OH. (HO2. + NO ® NO2  + OH<strong>.</strong>).</li>
				    <li>Sulfur trioxide reacts very  quickly with H2O to form sulfuric acid, which is the principal cause  of acid rain.</li>
			      </ul>
</div>
				<p align="justify"> SO3 + H2O                            H2SO4</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Sulfuric acid molecules rapidly  become particles by either condensing on existing particles in the air or by  merging with water vapour to from H2O – H2SO4  droplets.</li>
				    <li>Often a significant  fraction  of particulate matter in the  atmosphere consists of such sulfate (SO42-) aerosols.</li>
				    <li>The  transformation from SO2 gas to sulfate particles is  gradual, taking a matter of days. In either form, sulfur can be deposited during  precipitation (wet deposition) or by slow continuous removal processes that  occur without precipitation (dry deposition).</li>
				    <li>Most sulfate particles in urban  air have en effective size of less than 2 µm, with most of them being in the  range of 0.2 µm. Their size allows deep penetration into the respiratory  system.  </li>
				    <li>SO2 is highly water  soluble (much more than any of the other criteria pollutants). As a result,  when it is inhaled it is most likely to be absorbed in the most passages of the  upper respiratory tract, the nose and upper air ways.</li>
				    <li>However, when sulfur is  entrained in an aerosol, the aerodynamic properties of the particles themselves  affect the area of deposition and it is possible for sulfur oxides to reach far  deeper into the lungs.</li>
				    <li>The combination of particulate  matter and sulfur oxides can than act synergistically, with the effects of both  together being much more detrimental than either of them separately.</li>
				    <li>Sulfur oxides can damage  vegetation. Sulfur pollutants can discolour paint, corrode metals and cause  organic fibres to weaken. Airborne sulfates significantly reduce visibility and  discolour the atmosphere.</li>
				    <li>Prolonged exposure to sulfates  causes serious damage to building marble, lime stone (CaCO3) and  mortar, as the carbonates in these materials are replaced by sulfates.</li>
			      </ul>
</div>
				<p align="justify">CaCO3 + H2SO4  ® CaSO4 + CO2 + H2O<br />
				  The calcium sulfate (gypsum) produced by  this reaction is water soluble and easily washes away, leaving a pitted, eroded  surface.</p>
				<h1 align="justify">d).Lead</h1>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Most lead emissions in the past  have been from motor vehicles burning gasoline containing the antiknock  additive, tetraethyl lead, (C2 H5 )4 Pb. <strong></strong></li>
				    <li>Lead is emitted to the  atmosphere primarily in the form of inorganic particulates. </li>
				    <li>Much of this is removed from  the atmosphere by settling in the immediate vicinity of the source.</li>
				    <li>Air borne lead may affect human  populations by direct inhalation, in which case people living nearest to  highways are at greatest risk, or it can be ingested after the lead is  deposited onto food stuffs.</li>
				    <li>Most of human exposure to  airborne lead is the result of inhalation. It has been estimated that about one  third of the lead particles inhaled are deposited in the respiratory system and  that about half of those are absorbed by the blood stream.</li>
				    <li>The NAAQS standard for lead –  1.5 µg/m3. </li>
				    <li>Lead poisoning can cause  aggressive, hostile and destructive behavioral changes as well as learning  disabilities, seizures, severe and permanent brain damage and even death.  Children and pregnant women are at greatest risk.</li>
				    <li>Blood lead levels associated  with neurobehavioral changes in children appear to begin at 50-60 µg per  decilitre (µg/dL). Encephalopathy, with possible  brain damage or death occurs at levels some  what 80 µg / dL. </li>

				<p align="justify"><strong>Effects  of air pollution</strong><br />
				  Air  pollution is known to have many adverse effects, including those on human  health, building facades and other exposed materials, vegetation, agricultural  crops, animals, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and the climate of earth as  a whole.<br />
  <strong>a)Health  effects</strong><br />
				  Perhaps  the most important effect of air pollution is the harm it causes to human  health.  Generally, air pollution is most  harmful to the very old and the very young.   Many elderly people may already suffer from some form of heart or lung  disease, and their weakened condition can make them very susceptible to  additional harm from air pollution.  The  sensitive lungs of new born infants are also susceptible to harm from dirty  air.  But it is not just the elderly or  the very young who suffer; healthy people of all ages can be adversely affected  by high levels of air pollutants. Major health effects are categorized as being  acute, chronic, or temporary. <br />
				  There  is much evidence linking lung cancer to air pollution, although the actual  cause-and – effect relationship is still unknown. Typical effects of sulfur  dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, and ozone include eye and throat irritation,  coughing and chest pain. Nitrogen dioxide is known to cause pulmonary edema, an  accumulation of excessive fluids in the lungs. Ozone, a highly irritating gas,  produces pulmonary congestion; symptoms of ozone exposure may include dry  throat, headache, disorientation, and altered breathing patterns. <br />
  <strong>b)Effect on Materials</strong><br />
				  Every  year , air pollutants cause damage worth billions of rupees. Air pollutants  breakdown the exterior paint in cars and houses. Air pollutants have discolored  irreplaceable monuments, historic buildings, marble statues and other heritage  and natural beauty sites.<br />
  <strong>c)Effect on plants.</strong><br />
				  Some gaseous pollutants  enter leaf pores and damage the crop plants. Chronic exposure of leaves to air  pollutants damages waxy coating, leads to damage from diseases, pests, drought  and frost. Such exposure interferes with photosysthesis and plant growth, reduces  nutrient uptake and causes leaves to turn yellow, brown or drop off. At higher  concentrations of SO2 most of the flower buds become stiff and hard  and fall off. Prolonged exposure to higher levels of air pollutants from Iron  smelters, coal burning power plants and industries, vehicles can damage trees  and plants.<br />
  <strong>d)on  Stratosphere</strong><br />
				  Ozone is continuously being created in the stratosphere by the  absorption of short-wavelength UV radiation, while at the same time it is  continuously being removed by various chemical reactions that convert it back  to molecular oxygen. The rates of creation  and removal at any given time and location dictate the concentration of  ozone present.  The balance between  creation and removal is being affected by increasing stratospheric  concentrations of chlorine, nitrogen and bromine, which acts as catalysts,  speeding up the removal process. CFCs are predominant. <br />
  <strong> Management of Air Pollution</strong><br />
				  For ages man has been dumping wastes into the atmosphere, and these  pollutants have disappeared with the wind. We have seen that the main sources  of air pollution are (i) motor vehicles, (ii) industries-particularly their  chimney wastes, (iii) fossil-fuel (coal) based plants, as thermal power plants.  Steps are to be taken to control pollution at source (prevention) as well as  after the release so pollutants in the atmosphere. There is an urgent need to  prevent the emissions from the above said major sources of air pollution. The  control of emissions can be realized in number of ways <br />
                </p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>1.  Source Correction</strong>:  There are several approaches or strategies for air pollution control.  The most effective control would be to  prevent the pollution from occurring in the first place.   Complete source shutdown would accomplish  this, but shutdown is only practical under emergency conditions, and even then  it causes economic loss.  Nevertheless,  state public health officials can force industries to stop operations and can  curtain highway traffic if an air pollution episode is imminent or occurring. <br />
				  An  important approach for air pollution control is to encourage industries to make  fuel substitutions or process changes.   For example, making more use of solar, hydroelectric, and geothermal  energy would eliminate much of the pollution caused by fossil fuel combustion  at power generating plants.  Nuclear  power would do the same, but other problems related to high level radioactive  waste disposal and safety remain to be solved. Fuel substitutions are also  effective in reducing pollution from mobile sources.  For example, the use of reformulated gasoline  or alternative fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas, compressed natural gas,  or methanol for highway vehicles would help to clear the air. The use of  correct operation and maintenance practices is important for minimizing air pollution  and should not be overlooked as an effective control strategy. <br />
  <strong>2.   Collection of pollutants:</strong><br />
				  Often  the most serious problem in air pollution control is the collection of the  pollutants so as to provide treatment. Automobiles are most dangerous, but only  because the emissions can not be readily collected. If we could channel the  exhausts from automobiles to some central facilities, their treatment would be  much more reasonable than controlling each individual car. One success in  collecting pollutants has been the recycling of blowby gases in the internal  combustion engine. By reigniting these gases and emitting them through the  car’s exhaust system, the need of installing a separate treatment device for  the car can be eliminated.<br />
  <strong>3.  Cooling:</strong> The exhaust gases to be treated are  sometimes too hot for the control equipment and the gases must first be cooled.  This can be done in three general ways: dilution, quenching, or heat exchange  coils. Dilution is acceptable only if the total amount of hot exhaust is small.  Quenching has the additional advantage of scrubbing out some of these gases and  particulates. The cooling coils are perhaps the most widely used, and are  especially appropriate when heat can be conserved.<br />
  <strong>4.  Treatment</strong><br />
				  The  selection of the correct treatment device requires the matching of the  characteristics of pollutant and  features of the control device. It is  important to realize that the sizes of air pollutants range many orders of  magnitude, and it is therefore not reasonable to expect one device to be  effective for all pollutants. Although, any new devices may appear any day in  the market, the following are the most widely used:</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong>Setting chambers</strong> are nothing more than  large places in the flues, similar to settling tanks in water treatment. These  chambers remove only the large particulates. </li>
				    <li><strong>Cyclones</strong> are widely used for removing  large particulars. The dirty air is blasted into a conical cylinder, but off  the centerline. This creates violent swirl within the cone, and the heavy  solids migrate to the wall of the cylinder where they slow down due to friction  and exit at the bottom of the cone. The clean air is in the middle of the  cylinder and exits out the top. Cyclones are widely used as pre-cleaners to  remove the heavy material before further treatment.</li>
				    <li><strong>Bag filters</strong> operate like the common  vacuum cleaner. Fabric bags are used to collect the dust which must be  periodically shaken out of the bags. The fabric removes nearly all  particulates. Bag filters are widely used in many industries, but are sensitive  to high temperature and humidity.</li>
				    <li><strong>Wet collectors</strong> come in many shapes and  styles. The simple spray tower is an effective method for removing large  particulates. More efficient scrubbers promote the contact between air and  water by violent action in a narrow throat section into which the water is  introduced. </li>
				    <li><strong>Electrostatic precipitators</strong> are widely  used in power plants. The particulate matter is removed by first being charged  by electrons jumping from one high voltage electrode to the other, and then migrating  to the positively charged electrode. The particulates will collect on the pipe  and must be removed by banging the pipes with hammers. Electrostatic  precipitators have no moving parts, require electricity, and are extremely  effective in removing submicron particulates. They are expensive.</li>
				    <li><strong>Gas scrubbers</strong> are simply wet collectors  as described above but are used for dissolving the gases.</li>
				    <li><strong>Absorption</strong> is the use of the material  such as activated carbon to capture pollutants. Such adsorbers may be expensive  to regenerate. Most of these work well for organics and have limited use for  inorganic pollutants.</li>
				    <li><strong>Incineration</strong> is a method for removing  gaseous pollutants by burning them to CO2, H2O and  inerts. This works only for combustible vapours.</li>
				    <li><strong>Catalytic combustion</strong> involves the use of  a catalyst to adsorb or chemically change the pollutants. </li>

				<p align="justify"><strong>5.  Dispersion</strong><br />
				  The  concentration of the pollutants at the recipient is affected by atmospheric  dispersion, or how the pollutant is diluted with clean air. This dispersion  takes place horizontally as well as vertically. Earth rotation presents new  areas for the sun to shine upon and to warm air. Accordingly a pattern of winds  is set up around the world, some seasonal (e.g. hurricanes) and some permanent.<br />
				  Diffusion  is the process of spreading out the emission over a large area and thus  reducing the concentration of the specific pollutants. The plume spread or  dispersion as told above is horizontal as well as vertical. We assume that the  maximum concentration of pollutants is in the plume centerline, i.e. in the  direction of the prevailing wind. As we move further from the centerline, the  concentration becomes lower. If we assume that the spread of a plume in both  directions is approximated by a Gaussian probability curve, we can calculate  the concentration of a pollutant at any distance X downwind from the source. <br />
