				<p align="justify"><strong>(GHG emission, GH effect, impact on environment and agriculture  – mitigation strategies, Ozone depletion and Acid Deposition</strong>)</p>
				<p align="justify">Air pollution problems are not necessarily  confined to a local or regional scale.   Atmospheric circulation can transport certain pollutants far away from  their point of origin, expanding air pollution to continental or global scales;  it can truly be said that air quality problems know no international  boundaries.  Some air pollutants are  known to be associated with changes in Earth’s climate, requiring consideration  of governmental actions to limit their impacts. Two important air pollution  problems that are generally considered worldwide in scope are <strong>global warming</strong> and <strong>depletion of stratospheric ozone.</strong><br />
                    <strong>Greenhouse Gases </strong><br />
				  Since CO2 is confined exclusively  to the troposphere, its higher concentration may act a serious pollutant. Under  normal conditions (with normal CO2 Concentration) the temperature at  the surface of the earth is maintained by the energy balance of the sun rays  that strike the planet the planet and heat that is radiated back into space.  However, when there is an increase in CO2 concentration, the thick  layer of this gas prevents the heat from being re-radiated out. This thick CO2  layer thus functions like the glass panels of a greenhouse (or the glass  windows of a motor car), allowing the sunlight to filter through but preventing  the heat from being re-radiated in outer space. This is the so-called  greenhouse effect. Nitrogen and oxygen, the main constituents of the  atmosphere, play no part in the green house effect.  But there are approximately 35 trace gases  that scientists believe contribute to global warming.  <strong>Carbon  dioxide (CO2)</strong> is considered to be one of the most important of  these greenhouse gases, absorbing most of the heat trapped by the atmosphere.<br />
				  Other gases of special  importance in global warming are <strong>chlorofluorocarbons</strong> (CFCs), <strong>methane, nitrous oxide</strong> and <strong>ozone.</strong>   Although the average concentrations of these gases are much lower than  that of carbon dioxide, they are much more efficient than carbon di oxide at  soaking up long – wave radiation.   Overall, carbon dioxide is estimated to cause almost 60 per cent of the  warming effect and CFCs about 25 per cent, and the remainder is caused by  methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and other trace gases. <br />
				  More than  80% of the mass of the atmosphere and virtually all of water vapour, clouds and  precipitation occur in the troposphere. Earth's surface, it consists of <em>troposphere,  stratosphere, mesosphere</em> and the <em>thermosphere. </em>Troposphere extends upto 10-12 km at mid latitudes  (at equator – 18 km, at poles 5-6 km). In troposphere, temperatures  typically decrease at 5-7°C per km (wet adiabatic  lapse rate). <br />
				  Above the  troposphere is a stable layer of very dry air called stratosphere. Pollutants that find their way into the  stratosphere may remain there for many years, before they eventually drift back  into the troposphere à removed by rainfall or  settling. In the stratosphere, short wavelength UV  energy is absorbed by ozone, causing the air to be heated. The resulting  temperature inversion is what causes the stratosphere to be so stable. The  troposphere and stratosphere combined account for 99.9% of the mass of the  atmosphere. Together they extend to only about 50 km above the surface of the  earth.</p>

				<h1 align="justify">CARBON DIOXIDE</h1>
				<p align="justify">CO2  has been recognized for its importance as a greenhouse gas for almost a  century. Arrhenius (1896) is usually credited with the first calculations on  global temperature as a function of atmospheric CO2 content.<br />
                    <strong>The carbon cycle</strong> <br />
				  Carbon moves continually from the atmosphere into the food chain  during photosynthesis and returns to the atmospheric during respiration.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>From the atmosphere it can be  assimilated by plants on the land or in the oceans, or it can dissolve into the  sea water.</li>
				    <li>Respiration by living things,  including decomposers that are feeding on dead organic matter, return CO2  either to the oceans or to the atmosphere.</li>
				    <li>A very small portion of the dead  organic matter each year ends up being buried in sediments. The slow,  historical accumulation of buried organic matter is the source of our fossil  fuels – oil, gas and coal.</li>
				    <li>When these are burned, C in the form  of CO2 is returned to the atmosphere. The rapid accumulation of CO2  in the atmosphere is attributed mainly to fossil fuel burning and deforestation.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Historical emissions of CO2</strong></p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>The concentration of CO2 in  the atmosphere at the beginning of the 19th century was around 280  ppm. By 1990 it was 355 ppm and was climbing at about 1.5 ppm per year </li>
				    <li>CO2 concentrations in 1990  were more than 25 per cent higher than those just before the industrial  revolution.</li>
				    <li>1 ppm rise in CO2 rise  would add 2.12 Gt C into the atmosphere.</li>
				    <li>However, some carbon added to the  atmosphere will be absorbed by the oceans or taken up by the plants during  photosynthesis, thus, not all emissions will result in increased CO2  concentrations.</li>
				    <li>It is convenient to represent the  fraction of emissions that remain in the atmosphere with a quantity called the <em>airborne fraction</em>.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">Airborne fraction                     =             <br />
				  where (D c  atmosphere) is the change in carbon content of the atmosphere and <br />
				  (D c  emissions) is the total amount of carbon added to the atmosphere.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Values of airborne fraction has been  estimated at anywhere from 0.4 to 0.7, with 0.5 being a commonly used ratio.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Equilibrium temperature increase  caused by CO2</strong></p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Considerable effort has gone into  attempting to quantify the relationship between expected global temperature  change and CO2 concentration.</li>
				    <li>Typical of current understanding is  that a doubling of CO2 will likely result in an eventual global  warming of approximately 1.5 –4.5°C.</li>
				    <li>An increase of only 1.5°C over the pre  industrial temperature would make the earth warmer than it has been in the last  10,000 years.</li>
				    <li>In the past 100 years or so, an  increase of 0.5°C has actually occurred in the global average surface temperature.</li>
				    <li>Elevated temperatures increase  evaporation, increasing the amount of water vapour in the air. Since water  vapour is a green house gas, it might cause even more warming. On the other  hand, increased cloudiness may increase the albedo. Increasing albedo would  lead to global cooling.</li>
			      </ul>

				  CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS </p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>CFCs are mainly used as refrigerants, solvents, foaming agents in the  production of rigid and flexible foams and as aerosol propellants for such  products as deodorants, hairspray and spray paint.</li>
				    <li>Chloroflurocarbons (CFCs) are molecules that contain chlorine, fluorine  and carbon.</li>
				    <li>As opposed to other greenhouse gases, CFCs do not occur naturally and  their presence in the atmosphere is due entirely to human activities.</li>
				    <li>CFCs absorb strongly in the atmospheric window (7-12 µm) and tend to  have long atmospheric residence times. Hence they are potent greenhouse gases.</li>
				    <li>The two CFCs that have received the most attention, in both ozone and  climate change contexts are  trichlorofluoromethane, CFCl3 (CFC-11), and dichlorofluoromethane,  CF2Cl2 (CFC-12).</li>
				    <li>CFC molecules are inert and non–water soluble, so they are not  destroyed through chemical reactions or removed with precipitation.</li>
				    <li>The only known removal mechanism is photolysis by short wavelength  solar radiation, which occurs after the molecules drift into the stratosphere.  The chlorine freed during this process can go on to destroy stratospheric  ozone.</li>
				    <li>CFCs are mainly used as refrigerants, solvents, foaming agents in the  production of rigid and flexible foams and as aerosol propellants for such  products as deodorants, hairspray and spray paint.</li>
				    <li>Some of the CFCs are based on a one-carbon methane structure, such as  trichlorofluromethane (CFCl3) and dichlorofluromethane (CF2Cl2),  they were often referred as <em>chlorofluromethanes or CFMs</em>. The Duiont  trade name freon has also been used.</li>
				    <li>When molecules contain only fluorine, chlorine and carbon, they care  called <em>fully halogenated CFCs</em>.</li>
				    <li>Some CFCs contain hydrogen as well as chlorine, fluorine and carbon and  they are called <em>hydrochlorofulorocarbons or HCFCs</em>.</li>
				    <li>HCFCs have the environmental advantage that, due to the hydrogen bond,  they are less stable in the atmosphere and hence, are less likely to reach the  stratosphere to affect the ozone layer. The ozone depleting potential of HCFCs  is only 2-5% compared most commonly used CFCs. The most widely used CFCs are  CFC –11, CFC –12 and CFC –113.</li>
				    <li>When no chlorine is present in the molecule, they are called <em>hydroflurocarbons  or HFCs</em>. HFCs are important replacements for CFCs, since their lack of  chlorine means they do not threaten the ozone layer. </li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">OTHER GREENHOUSE GASES</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li><em>Methane </em>is a naturally occurring gas that is increasing  in concentration, as a result of human activities.</li>
				    <li>It is produced by bacterial fermentation under anaerobic conditions,  such as in swamps, marshes, rice paddies, as well as in the digestive systems  of ruminants and termites.</li>
				    <li>It is also released during the production, transportation and  consumption of fossil fuels, as well as when biomass fuels are burned.</li>
				    <li>After its release, methane is thought to have an atmospheric residence  time of around 8-11 years. It is eventually removed through oxidation with  various OH radicals.</li>
				    <li>Methane concentrations have increased rapidly in the past 20 years  and correlate quite well with human  population size.</li>
				    <li><em>Nitrous oxide</em> is another naturally occurring greenhouse gas  that has been increasing in concentration due to human activities.</li>
				    <li>It is released into the atmosphere mostly during the nitrification  portion of the nitrogen cycle</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">NH4+      à N2 à N2O à NO2- à NO3-</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <ul>
				      <li>Combustion of fossil fuels and nitrogen fertilizer consumption are  thought to be the two most important human activities leading to increases in  nitrous oxide levels.</li>
				      <li>It apparently has no significant tropospheric sinks and is only slowly  degraded in the stratosphere by photolysis.</li>
				      <li>The destruction process in the stratosphere involves a reaction with  atomic oxygen leading to formation of nitric oxide, which in turn reacts  catalytically with ozone.</li>
				      <li>The desired removal of nitrous oxide, then, has the undesired effect of  reducing stratospheric ozone.</li>
				      <li>Nitrous oxide has an extremely long residence time of 150 years in the  atmosphere. It has strong absorption bands at 4.5, 7.8 and 17 µm and it is  thought to be about 230 times as potent as CO­2 in causing global  warming.</li>
				      <li><em>Ozone</em> plays an important role in both troposphere and stratosphere.</li>
				      <li>About 90% of atmospheric ozone resides in the stratosphere and it  protects life by absorbing short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation.</li>
				      <li>Stratospheric ozone also affects climate, but in a very complex way.  Incoming solar energy is absorbed, which heats the stratosphere. This, however,  reduces the radiation arriving at the earth's surface, thereby cooling the  surface.</li>
				      <li>On the other hand, the warmed stratosphere radiates energy back to the  earth's surface, thereby heating it. The net effect is uncertain.</li>
				      <li>In the troposphere, ozone is a component of photochemical smog and it  poses a serious health problem.</li>
				      <li>Tropospheric ozone absorbs strongly at around 9.6 µm, right in the  middle of the atmospheric window. Increasing concentrations could contribute to  raising global temperatures.</li>
				      <li>Ozone, however, has a rather short residence time in the troposphere,  measured in days. It is irregularly distributed by time of day,  geographic location, and altitude. So it has  been difficult to assess its overall change with time, leaving us uncertain as  to its impact on climate.</li>
			        </ul>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<h2 align="justify">The  Greenhouse effect</h2>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Nearly all the  incoming solar energy arrives extra terrestrially, with wavelength less than 4  µm (short wavelength radiation), while the outgoing energy radiated by the  earth has essentially all of its energy in wavelength greater than 4 µm (long  wavelength or thermal radiation) </li>
				    <li>Essentially all the incoming solar  radiation with wavelengths less than 0.3 µm (ultraviolet) is absorbed by oxygen  and ozone in the stratosphere.</li>
				    <li>Most of the long  wave-length energy radiated by the earth is affected by a combination of  radiatively active gases, most importantly water vapour (H2O), CO2,  N2O and CH4.</li>
				    <li>Radiatively active gases that absorb  wavelengths longer than 4 µm are called <em>greenhouse gases</em>.</li>
				    <li>These gases trap most of the outgoing  thermal radiation attempting to leave the earth's surface. This absorption  heats the atmosphere, which, in turn, radiates energy back to the earth as well  as out to space.</li>
				    <li>The greenhouse effect adds 33°C of  warming to the surface of the earth, i.e., if there was no greenhouse effect, the  earth would have an average temperature of –18°C or about 0°C.</li>
				    <li>Distributed over  the entire surface of the earth, the incoming solar radiation is equal to 343  W/m2.</li>
				    <li>Since the albedo is 30% (103 W/m2),  the amount of incoming radiation absorbed by the atmosphere and earth is 240  W/m2.</li>
				    <li>Of that 240 W/m2, 86 W/m2  are absorbed by the atmosphere and the remaining 154 W/m2 are  absorbed by the surface of the earth.</li>
			      </ul>

				<p align="justify"><strong>Global  Warming and Climate Change</strong><br />
				  Carbon dioxide is a green house  gas that is confined to the troposphere and its higher concentration may act as  a serious pollutant.  Under normal  conditions the temperature at the surface of the earth is maintained by energy  balance of the sun rays that strike the planet and heat that is reradiated back  into space. However when there is an increase in CO2 concentration,  the thick layer of the gas prevents the heat from being reradiated out.  This thick CO2 layer functions  like the glass panel of a green house, allowing the sun light to filter through  but preventing the heat from being reradiated into outer space.  Therefore, it is warmer inside the green  house than outside.  Similar condition is  resulted in the troposphere of the earth and termed as <strong>‘Green house effect’</strong>.<br />
				  Carbon dioxide concentration of the troposphere  has been increasing steadily due to industrial growth.  Nearly hundred years ago the CO2  concentration was 275 ppm, today it is 350 ppm and by the year 2040 it is  expected to reach 450 ppm.  Certain gases  in the atmosphere, known as ‘green house’ gases like CO, CO2, CH4  are able to absorb and emit heat.  When  sunlight strikes the earth’s surface it warms up, emits heat, which radiates  upwards into space.  This heat warms up  the green house gases so that they also emit heat, some into space and some  back down to earth, which results in heating up of the earth atmosphere, also  known as <strong>Global warming. </strong>                     <strong> </strong><strong></strong><br />
				  Average land surface  temperatures are increasing worldwide.   In fact, the decade of the 1990s was the warmest ever recorded, and the  trend of gradually rising average temperatures seems to be continuing.  By some estimates, global mean temperature  has risen roughly 0.5oC (1°F) since the end of the 19th  century.  This may seem to be an  insignificant rise, given the wide variation in temperatures that occur on a  daily and annual basis at any given location, as well as the obvious difficulty  in measuring, collecting, and interpreting world wide temperature records  dating as far back as a century or more ago.   But most atmospheric scientists think that even a small increase in  average global temperature can have a noticeable impact on Earth’s climate. <br />
  <strong>Potential impacts of global warming on  Environment, Agriculture and Human Health</strong><br />
				  One of the methods that  scientists used to estimate the impacts of global warming involves computer  analysis of mathematical equations that model Earth’s atmosphere.   Typically, these sophisticated computer  programs are called General Circulation Models (GCMs).  As a basis for predicting future global  impacts, most models assume that the concentration of greenhouse gases will  effectively double. On this basis, the GCMs generally predict an average global  warming of up to 42oC (7.5oF) and an overall increase in  precipitation of about 10 per cent by the year 2050.  It is also expected that global warming will  create a more active hydrologic cycle, increasing cloudiness as well as  precipitation.<br />
				  Recent estimates suggest that  global sea level has risen by about 0.15 m during the 20th century,  with most of the rise occurring since 1930.   Some scientists believe that, because of global warming, average sea  levels may raise by at least 0.3 m and as much as 1.4 m by the year 2030.  This is likely to cause extensive economic  and social hardship in coastal areas all over the world. Temperature would  increase by 1.5 to 4.5°C . The polar icecaps would melt. A rise of five degrees  would raise the sea level by five meters within a few decades increase the  evaporation of water, thus reducing grain yield.<br />
				  Potential impacts of global  warming on ecosystems mainly include the effects on agriculture and forest  growth.  Plant growth and development  will be influenced by an increase in carbon di oxide levels, which stimulates  photosynthesis and decreases water losses from transpiration.                 In addition to affecting  agriculture and forests, global warming is expected to have other impacts.  For example, higher temperatures and humidity  may increase the chances of disease in humans and animals in some parts of the  world. <br />
  <strong>Ozone and Photochemical smog</strong><br />
				  Ozone (O3), a  secondary air pollutant in the troposphere, is formed by a set of exceedingly  complex chemical reactions between nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and  volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  VOCs  are hydrocarbons that quickly evaporate under normal atmospheric conditions.   The reactions are initiated by the  ultraviolet energy in sunlight.    Actually, a number of secondary pollutants (collectively termed  photochemical oxidants) are formed in the reactions.  Ozone, the most abundant of the oxidants, is  the key component of photochemical smog. It is universally accepted that the  ozone layer in the stratosphere protects us from the harmful UV radiations from  sun. The depletion of this O3 layer by human activities may have serious  implications and this has become a subject of much concern over the last few  years.               The ozone near the  earth’s surface in troposphere creates pollution problems. Ozone and other  oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide are formed by light dependent reactions  between NO2 and hydrocarbons. Ozone may also be formed by NO2  under UV-radiations effect. These pollutants cause photochemical smog.<br />
				  A series of harmful effects are  caused by an increase in UV radiation. Cancer is the best established threat to  man. When the O3 layer becomes thinner or has holes, it causes  cancers, especially relating to skin like melanoma. A 10% decrease in  stratospheric ozone appears likely to lead a 20-30% increase in skin cancer.  The other disorders are cataracts, destruction of aquatic life and vegetation  and loss of immunity. Photochemical smog is highly oxidizing polluted  atmosphere comprising largely of O3, NOx, H2O2,  organic peroxides, PAN, and PBz N. This is produced as a result of  photochemical reaction among NOz hydrocarbons and oxygen.<br />
				  The word <strong>smog</strong> is coined by combining smoke and fog which characterized air  pollution episode in London, Glasgow, Manchester and other cities of U.K. where  sulphur-rich coal was used. The term smog is said to have been coined in 1905  by H.A. Des Voeux. The U.K. smog was a mixture of reducing pollutants and has  been called reducing smog, whereas Los angels smog, a mixture of oxidizing  pollutants is called oxidizing smog or photochemical smog.<br />
                </p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Greenhouse gas inventory estimation – Indian Scenario</strong><br />
				  Estimations of anthropogenic GHG emission  inventories in India, began in a limited scale in 1991, which were enlarged and  revised and the first definitive report for the base year 1990 was published4  in 1992. Since then, several papers and reports have been published which have  upgraded the methodologies for estimation, included country-specific  emission factors and activity data, accounted  for new sources of emissions and new gases or pollutants. A comprehensive inventory  of the Indian emissions from all energy, industrial processes, agriculture  activities, land use, land use change and forestry and waste management  practices has recently been reported in India’s Initial National Communication  to the UNFCCC for the base year 1994. <br />
				  In 1994, 1228 million tonnes of CO2  equivalent emissions took place from all anthropogenic activities in India,  accounting for 3 per cent of the total global emissions. About 794 million  tonnes, i.e. about 63 per cent of the total CO2 equivalent emissions  was emitted as CO2, while 33 per cent of the total emissions (18  million tonnes) was CH4, and the rest 4 per cent (178 thousand  tonnes) was N2O. The CO2 emissions were dominated by  emissions due to fuel combustion in the energy and transformation activities,  road transport, cement and steel production. The CH4 emissions were  dominated by emissions from enteric fermentation in ruminant livestock and rice  cultivation. The major contribution to the total N2O emissions came  from the agricultural soils due to fertilizer applications. At a sectoral  level, the energy sector contributed 61 percent of the total CO2  equivalent emissions, with agriculture contributing about 28 per cent, the rest  of the emissions were distributed amongst industrial processes, waste  generation, and land use, land use change and forestry. <strong></strong><br />
  <strong>Comparative national emission trends</strong><br />
				  The compounded annual growth rate of CO2  equivalent emissions from India is between 1990 and 2000 showed an overall  increase by 4.2 per cent per annum. On a sectoral basis, the maximum growth in  emissions is from the industrial process sector (21.3 per cent per annum),  followed by the emissions from the waste sector (7.3 per cent per annum). The  energy sector emissions have only grown by 4.4 per cent per annum with almost  no increase in emissions registered from the agriculture sector. Significant  increase in emissions from the industrial process sector can be attributed to  the growth in cement and steel production in India over the decade. Similarly,  increase in emissions from the waste sector can be attributed to increase in  quantity of waste generated due to the large influx of population from villages  to cities in 2000 with respect to 1990, where because of systematic waste  disposal practices; anaerobic conditions are created leading to CH4  emissions.<br />
				  Data from some of the developed countries  indicate that between 1990 and 2000, there has been a decline in the compounded  annual growth rates of GHGs such as in the case of Russian federation, Germany  and UK were the growth rates have decreased by –2.8, –2.0 and –1.4 per cent per  annum respectively. In comparison, the emissions from Japan, USA and India have  grown by 1.6, 2.0 and 4.2 per cent per annum respectively within the same  period. Even the emissions from China and Brazil for the period 1990–1995 show  a high compounded annual growth rate of 5 and 6 per cent respectively. Though  the compounded annual growth rates of CO2 equivalent emissions from  India are on a higher side (4.2 per cent per annum), the absolute value of  these emissions is still 1/6th of that of USA. Also, the per capita GHG  emissions from India are one of the lowest. In the year 2000, the US per capita  CO2 equivalent emission was 15.3 times more than that of India. The  German per capita emissions were 8.0 times higher. Similarly, the Japanese per  capita CO2 equivalent emissions were 6.7 times higher than that of  India.  Even when compared with  developing countries such as China and Brazil, the Indian per capita emissions  were 2.2 and 1.3 times lower respectively.<br />
				  For almost all the countries, the share of CO2  emissions is actually increasing continuously between the period 1990 and 2000  and it is the CH4 and N2O emissions which have decreased in  this period, resulting in an overall decrease in the growth rates of the CO2  equivalent emissions. Exceptions are in the case of India, where the N2O  emissions are also increasing, and in the case of UK and Germany, where all  three emissions are declining. Further the decrease in emission trends in  Germany and the UK, is due to the fact that the solid and liquid fuel use in  these countries is on the decline and the natural gas consumption is  increasing. Japan is the only country amongst all the countries considered,  where the solid fuel use has increased between 1990 and 2000. In the USA, the  fuel mix has remained same between 1990 and 2002, with maximum use of liquid  fuel, followed by gaseous and solid fuel. In India too, the commercial fuel mix  has remained almost the same between 1990 and 2002, wherein 10 per cent of the  fuel used is solid fuel, 81 per cent is liquid fuel and the rest is gaseous  fuel. Penetration of commercial biomass as a main fuel source is still very  low.</p>

The GHG intensity of the Indian economy in  the year 2000, in terms of the purchasing power parity, is estimated to be  little above 0.4 tonne CO2 equivalent per 1000 US dollars, which is  lower than that of the USA and the global average. The Indian Government has  targeted an 8% GDP growth rate per annum for 2002–07 to achieve its development  priorities. In order to achieve these developmental aspirations, substantial  additional energy consumption will be necessary and coal, being the abundant  domestic energy resource, would continue to play a dominant role. Since GHGs  emissions are directly linked to economic growth, India’s economic activities  will necessarily involve increase in GHGs emissions from the current levels.  The CO2 equivalent emissions from India are set to increase up to  3000 million tonnes by 2020. Energy and power sector reforms, for instance,  have helped to enhance the technical and economic efficiency of energy use.  Policies adopted by India for a sustainable development, such as energy  efficiency, improvement measures in various sectors, increasing penetration of  cleaner fuels. And a thrust for renewable energy technologies have all  contributed towards GHG emission reduction since the last decade. Past few  years have also witnessed introduction of landmark environmental measures that  have targeted cleansing of rivers, enhanced forestation, installed significant  capacity of hydro and renewable energy technologies.<strong></strong>The Indian  government has simultaneously introduced clean coal technologies like coal  washing and introduced the use of cleaner and lesser carbon intensive fuel,  like introducing auto LPG and setting up of Motor Spirit-Ethanol blending  projects in selected states. <br />
<strong>Climate Change Effects</strong><br />
<strong>Sea level and climate change</strong><br />
One quarter of the Indian population live  along the country’s coasts, and are largely dependent on coastal livelihoods.  Climate change effects on sea level can impact coastal areas in two ways –  through increase in mean sea level, and through increased frequency and intensity  of coastal surges and storms. Climate change is of concern to India in view of  the damages that occur along the east coast of India from the cyclones that  form in the Bay of Bengal. Any increase in the frequency or intensity of  tropical disturbances due to climate change in the future could cause increased  damages to life and property in the coastal regions. The National Institute of  Oceanography (NIO) and the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI)  conducted a study on the impacts of climate change on sea level to assess the  degree to which mean sea level and the occurrence of extreme events may change.<br />
<strong>The National Institute of  Oceanography</strong><br />
The National Institute of Oceanography (NIO)  is a research organization of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research  (CSIR), Government of India. NIO is a large oceanographic laboratory with a  focus on the oceanography of the seas around India. Their core areas of study  are ocean processes, coastal studies, resource surveys, conservation, and ocean  engineering. <br />
<strong>Predicted climate change impacts  on sea level</strong><br />
As a result of the study, the following  changes due to climate change were predicted for sea level:<br />
<strong>Mean sea level</strong>: Mean  sea level rise estimates (using past tide gauge data) were found to be slightly  less than 1 mm/yr for most of the stations analyzed along the Indian coast.  However, data on vertical land movements was not available, and will need to be  incorporated in order to obtain net sea level rise estimates.<br />
<strong>Storm surges</strong>: The  study showed a greater number of high surges under climate change. In addition,  the model showed an increased occurrence of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal,  particularly in the post-monsoon period, along with increased maximum wind  speeds associated with cyclones.<br />
<strong>Agriculture and climate change</strong><br />
The agricultural sector represents 35% of  India’s Gross National Product (GNP) and as such plays a crucial role in the  country’s development. Food grain production quadrupled during the  post-independence era; this growth is projected to continue. The impact of  climate change on agriculture could result in problems with food security and  may threaten the livelihood activities upon which much of the population  depends. Climate change can affect crop yields (both positively and  negatively), as well as the types of crops that can be grown in certain areas,  by impacting agricultural inputs such as water for irrigation, amounts of solar  radiation that affect plant growth, as well as the prevalence of pests. The  Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) examined the vulnerability of  agricultural production to climate change, with the objective of determining  differences in climate change impacts on agriculture by region and by crop.<br />
<strong>Models used to predict climate change impacts on  agriculture</strong><br />
The following models were developed to  evaluate the impacts of changes in temperature and carbon dioxide on crops:<br />
<strong>1. INFOCROP</strong>, a generic growth model for various crops,  was developed by IARI for optimal resource and agronomic management options. <br />
<strong>2. INFOCANE</strong>, a simple sugarcane growth model, was  developed by IARI to measure effects on cane yield. <br />
<strong>Human Health and climate change</strong><br />
Both climatologically and medical communities  are increasingly concerned that climate change is likely to have wide-ranging  impacts on health. The poor, as well as the elderly, children, and the disabled  are likely to be most vulnerable to these changes, as they already face limited  access to health facilities. Among vector-borne diseases in India, malaria is  of considerable concern. Periodic epidemics of malaria occur every five to  seven years, and the World Bank estimates that about 577,000 DALYs  (disability-adjusted life years) were lost due to malaria in India in 1998.  Climate change could increase the incidence of malaria in areas that are  already malaria-prone, and also introduce malaria into new areas. The National  Physical Laboratory (NPL), New Delhi undertook a study of the impacts of predicted  climate change on human health in India, with a particular focus on malaria.<br />

                    <strong>India’s Initiatives</strong><br />
				  India  has undertaken numerous response measures that are contributing to the  objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  (UNFCCC). India's development plans balance economic development and  environmental concerns. The planning process is guided by the principles of  sustainable development. Reforms in the energy and power sector have  accelerated economic growth and enhance the efficiency of energy use. These  have been complemented by notable initiatives taken by the private sector. <br />
				  In  the last few years several measures relating to environmental issues have been  introduced. They have targeted increasing significantly, the capacity of  renewable energy installations; improving the air quality in major cities (the  world's largest fleet of vehicles fuelled by compressed natural gas has been  introduced in New Delhi); and enhancing afforestation. Other similar measures  have been implemented by committing additional resources and realigning new  investments, thus putting economic development on a climate-friendly path. <br />

                    <strong>Solar :  </strong>Photovoltaic  system based on solar energy have been put to a variety of uses in rural  electrification, railway signalling, microwave repeaters, power to border  outposts and TV transmission and reception. Grid-connected PV power plants with  an aggregate capacity of 1900 kWp have been set up for demand-side management  or tail-end voltage support. A 140 MW integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC)  plant is being set up based on&nbsp;solar thermal technology and liquified  natural gas.

                    <a name="Afforestation_and_land_restoration" id="Afforestation_and_land_restoration"><strong>Afforestation and land restoration</strong></a> <br />
				  The basic components of India's forest  conservation efforts include protecting existing forests, putting a check on  the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes, encouraging farm  forestry/private area plantations, expanding the protected area network and  controlling forest fires. Forests cover 19.4% of the country's landmass.  Forests with a crown cover of more than 40% have been increasing. The National  Forestry Action Programme has been formulated for sustainable forest  development and to bring one-third of the country's geographical area under  forest/ tree cover as mandated in the National Forest Policy, 1988. <br />
				  A major programme of afforestation is  being implemented with the people's participation under the Joint Forest  Management. The National Forest Policy  envisages the participation of people in the development of degraded forests to  meet their requirements of fuel wood, fodder and timber. Twelve biosphere  reserves have been set up to protect representative ecosystems. Management plans  are being implemented for 20 wetlands with coral reefs and mangroves being  given a priority. The National Wasteland Development Board is responsible for  regenerating private, non-forest and degraded land. The National Afforestation  and Eco Development Board is responsible for regenerating degraded forest land,  land adjoining forests and ecologically fragile areas. <br />
  <strong>Role of Methanotrophs and  Methylotrophs</strong><br />
				  The atmospheric concentration of  methane, a green house gas, has more than doubled during the past 200 years.  Consequently, identifying the factors influencing the flux of methane into the  atmosphere is becoming increasingly important. Methanotrophs, microaerophilic  organisms widespread in aerobic soils and sediments, oxidize methane to derive  energy and carbon for biomass hence, they play an important role in mitigating  the flux of methane into the atmosphere. Several physico chemical factors  influence rates of methane oxidation in soil including soil diffusivity, water  potential and levels of oxygen, methane, ammonium, nitrate, nitrite and copper.  Most of these factors exert their influence through interactions with methane  monooxygenase (MMO), the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction converting methane  to methanol, the first step in methane oxidation. Although biological factors  such as competition and predation undoubtedly play a role in regulating the  methanotroph population in soils, and thereby limit the amount of methane  consumed by methanotrophs. <br />
				  Methane, is second only to  carbon dioxide in its importance as a green house gas. The ability of  microorganisms to oxidize methane has been known since 1906, when <strong>Sohngen</strong> first isolated an organism  capable of growing on methane as a carbon source and named it <strong><em>Bacillus  methanicus</em></strong>. Since that time, methane oxidizing microorganisms  (methanotrophs) have been found in a variety of soil and aquatic environments.  Oxidation of methane to carbon dioxide in soil occurs primarily as part of  aerobic metabolism in methanotrophic bacteria. The net reaction of methane oxidation  under aerobic conditions can be described as:<br />
				  CH4   +     2O2                                    CO2   +   2H2O<br />
				  Methane  oxidation can also be linked to the reduction of sulphate in anaerobic  metabolism. Anaerobic methane oxidation has not been detected in environments  lacking sulphate and appears to be most prevalent in aquatic environments.<br />
				  Methanotrophs, are a subset of  the larger group of organisms that utilize one – carbon compounds, the  methylotrophs. Classically, the methanotrophs have been divided into a few main  genera: <em>Methylococcus</em>, <em>Methylomonas</em>,<em> Methylobacter</em>, <em>Methylosinus</em>, <em>Methylocystis,</em> <em>Methylobacterium</em> and <em>Methylosporovibrio.</em><br />
				  From a functional standpoint,  methanotrophs can be divided into three types based on their carbon  –assimilation pathway or pathways, as well as intra cytoplasmic membrane  arrangement, cell morphology and their guanine and cytosine content of their  DNA. Type I methanotrophs possess the ribulose monophosphate pathway, Type II  the serine pathway, and Type X both the pathways. <br />
  <strong>CARBON SEQUESTRATION </strong><br />
				  Global warming is amongst the most dreaded problems of the new  millennium. Carbon emission is supposedly the strongest causal factor for  global warming. So, increasing carbon emission is one of today’s major  concerns, which is well addressed in Kyoto Protocol. Trees are amongst the most  significant elements of any landscape, both due to biomass and diversity. Their  key role in ecosystem dynamics is well known. However, it is paradoxical that  the vegetation has undergone destruction and degradation in the modern times  due to industrial and technological advancement achieved by human society. This  advancement has resulted in emission of carbon in the ecosystem. Therefore,  there is need to address environmental issues related to them. Trees are  important sinks for atmospheric carbon i.e. carbon dioxide, since 50% of their  standing biomass is carbon itself. <br />
				  Nearly half the Indian population will soon be living in urban  areas. And urbanization is vigorously promoted both politically and socially as  a means to enhance average living standards. However, the ever-growing  urbanization threatens escalating of carbon emission due to higher consumption  of goods and services compared to the rural sector. Hence, it is crucial that  the balance be maintained between the carbon emission and carbon sequestration  to achieve sustainability. </p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Global  Carbon Sinks </strong><br />
				  Global carbon is held in a variety of different stocks. Natural  stocks include oceans, fossil fuel deposits, the terrestrial system and the  atmosphere. In the terrestrial system carbon is sequestered in rocks and  sediments, in swamps, wetlands and forests, and in the soils of forests,  grasslands and agriculture. About two-thirds of the globe’s terrestrial carbon,  exclusive of that sequestered in rocks and sediments, is sequestered in the  standing forests, forest under-storey plants, leaf and forest debris, and in  forest soils. In addition, there are some non-natural stocks. For example,  long-lived wood products and waste dumps constitute a separate human-created  carbon stock. A stock that is taking-up carbon is called a &quot;sink&quot; and  one that is releasing carbon is called a &quot;source.&quot; Shifts or flows of  carbon over time from one stock to another, for example, from the atmosphere to  the forest, are viewed as carbon &quot;fluxes.&quot; Over time, carbon may be  transferred from one stock to another. <br />
  <strong>How  Forest Ecosystems Act as Sinks: </strong>A sink is defined as a  process or an activity that removes greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.  Carbon sequestration is the extraction of the atmospheric carbon dioxide and  its storage in terrestrial ecosystems for a very long period of time - many  thousands of years. Forests offer some potential to be managed as a sink, that  is, to promote net carbon sequestration.<br />
  <strong>Carbon  Reduction Credits:</strong><br />
				  The cost aspect of forest based carbon sequestration, as an offset  mechanism is particularly important. It determines how carbon sequestration  compares with other potential carbon offset mechanisms in the broader scheme of  greenhouse gas reduction policies. According to the protocol, each country will  be given carbon credits based on the carbon emission and sequestration scenario.  If developing countries like India  has  to improve on the issue of carbon credits, then role of vegetation patches in  carbon sequestered should be considered. <br />
  <strong>Indian  Scene</strong><br />
				  According to Ravindranath <em>et al. </em>(1997) the standing  biomass (as above and below ground biomass) in India is estimated to be 8,375  million tons for the year 1986, of which the carbon storage would be 4,178  million tones. The total carbon stored in forests, including soil is estimated  to be 9578 m t. On the other hand, carbon emissions from fossil based energy  production and consumption activities in India have been estimated at 152-205 m  t per year. The corresponding estimate from agriculture activities including  fuel burning ranges from 43 m t to as high as 115 m t. The current rate of carbon  emission from agricultural and forestry sectors are just about being balanced  by the current rate of reforestation. <br />
  <strong>Plant  roots and carbon sequestration</strong><br />
				  Carbon management is a serious concern confronting  the world today. A number of summits have been organized on this subject  ranging from the Stockholm to Kyoto protocol. The current level of carbon in  the atmosphere is about 375 ppm. It is estimated that if the carbon increases  in the atmosphere at the present rate and no positive efforts are pursued, the  level of carbon in the atmosphere would go up to 800–1000 ppm by the end of  current century, which may create havoc for all living creatures on earth. Soil  may be an important sink for the carbon storage in the form of soil organic  carbon. This form of carbon is also a matter of serious concern for  agricultural scientists across the globe because various researches reveal that  the soil under intensive cultivation results in the increase.<br />
				  Since  the beginning of the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide concentration in the  atmosphere has been rising alarmingly. Plant roots have ability to synthesize,  accumulate and secrete a diverse array of compounds. More than 200 carbon  compounds released from plant roots in the form of exudates are reported, which  is termed as rhizodeposition. These exudates contain simple water-soluble  compounds such as amino acids, organic acids, sugar and various plant secondary  metabolites to complex polymeric compounds such as polysaccharides,  polypeptides and enzymes.<strong></strong><br />
  <strong>Soil carbon  sequestration</strong><br />
				  Soils  are the largest carbon reservoirs of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Soils  contain about three times more C than vegetation and twice as much as that  present in the atmosphere. Soils contain much more C (1500 Pg of C to 1 m depth  and 2500 Pg of C to 2 m; 1 Pg = 1 ´ 1015 g) than is contained in vegetation  (650 Pg of C) and twice as much C as the atmosphere (750 Pg of C). Carbon in  the form of organic matter is a key element to healthy soil. It is estimated  that each tonne of soil organic matter releases 3.667 tonnes of CO2,  which is lost into the atmosphere. Similarly, the build-up of each tonne of  soil organic matter removes 3.667 tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere.  The conversion of natural habitats to cropland and pasture, and unsustainable  land practices such as excessive tillage frees carbon from organic matter,  releasing it to the atmosphere as CO2. Depletion  of organic carbon, soils develop a carbon  deficit<em>. </em>Soils can regain lost carbon by reabsorbing it from the  atmosphere. This process is called carbon sequestration. <br />
  <strong>Agricultural  practices for carbon sequestration</strong><br />
				  The  carbon content of most agricultural soils is now about one-third less than that  in its native condition as either forest or grassland. Fortunately, modern  agriculture has stopped this net loss to the atmosphere. This has come about  through higher levels of biomass production, the return of greater proportions  of crop residue to the land, use of cover crops and conservation tillage such  as reduced and no till. Simultaneously, better fertility management through  soil testing, precision farming and proper nutrient application can also lead  to lowering of greenhouse gas emissions. Irrigation waters trap some CO2  because irrigated soils produce high crop residues which sequester carbon at a  rate of 0.16 to 0.27 Pg per year. <br />
  <strong>Carbon  and soil organic matter</strong><br />
				  Carbon is a key ingredient in soil organic matter (57% by weight).  Plants produce organic compounds by using sunlight energy and combining carbon  dioxide from the atmosphere with water from the soil. Soil organic matter is  created by the cycling of these organic compounds in plants, animals, and  microorganisms into the soil. Well decomposed organic matter forms humus, a  dark brown, porous, spongy material that provides a carbon and energy source  for soil microbes and plants. When soil is tilled, organic matter previously  protected from microbial action is decomposed rapidly because of changes in  water, air, and temperature conditions, and the breakdown of soil aggregate  accelerates erosion. <strong> </strong><br />
  <strong>What  still needs to be known?</strong><br />
				  Improvement in monitoring and verification protocols for carbon  sequestration in soil plant ecosystems is needed for quantitative economic and  policy analyses. Such protocols must be acceptable, both domestically and  internationally, to scientists, policy makers, landowners, and business groups.  These protocols must be suitable for use by employees of government agencies  and licensed professionals. Practical techniques to quantify the overall net  beneficial impact of agricultural and silvicultural practices on all greenhouse  gases, including methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)  are needed. Other beneficial services derived from improved land practices,  such as changes in soil quality, productivity, water and air quality, and  erosion must also be recognized and evaluated. Recommended carbon sequestration  practices must show benefit for the total environment from a whole ecosystem  accounting perspective. Long term studies are needed to insure that current  effective carbon sequestration practices result in stable carbon forms for the  long term (at least 20-50 years). <br />
  <strong>Acid deposition/Acid rain</strong><br />
				  The presence of excessive acid in rain water  is called Acid rain. It is a mixture of nitric acid , sulphuric acid and  carbonic acid.     Since the early 1970s,  problems associated with acidic precipitation have gained worldwide  attention.  Acid rain have damaged or  destroyed fish and plant life in thousands of lakes throughout central and  northern Europe (especially in Scandinavia), the north east United States,  south east Canada, and parts of China.   Many species of trees in forests throughout these regions have been in  decline, largely due to soil acidification.   Acid rain also causes pitting and corrosion of metals and the  deterioration of painted surfaces, concrete, limestone, and marble in  buildings, monuments, works of art, and other exposed objects.<br />
				  Acid rain is caused by the  emission of sulfur and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, mostly from the  burning of fossil fuels for electric power.   Other sources from human activities include certain industrial processes  and the gasoline powered automobile.   Sulfur dioxide reacts with water vapor in the air to form sulfuric acid;  nitrogen dioxide reacts with water vapor to form nitric acid.  It has been found that the contribution of  sulfur dioxide to acid rainfall is more than twice that from nitrogen oxides.  Contribution of these gases from natural  sources, such as from swamps and volcanoes, are small in comparison to human  sources.<br />
				  A major environmental impact of  acid deposition is the lowering of pH in lakes and rivers. Most aquatic life is  disrupted as the pH drops.  Phytoplankton  populations are reduced, and many common water – dwelling invertebrates, such  as may flies and stone flies, cannot survive when the pH falls below about 6.0.  Some sensitive species of fish, including  trout and salmon, are harmed when pH levels fall below 5.5.  Acidity has a deleterious effect on the  reproductive cycle of fish; when the pH is less than 4.9, reproduction of most  fish species is unlikely.  Acid dead  lakes have pH below about 3.5</p>

				  <strong>Changes In Stratospheric Ozone</strong><br />
				  Ozone is  continuously being created in the stratosphere by the absorption of  short-wavelength UV radiation, while at the same time it is continuously being  removed by various chemical reactions that convert it back to molecular oxygen.  The rates  of creation and removal at any given time and location dictate the  concentration of ozone present.   The balance between creation and removal is being affected by increasing  stratospheric concentrations of chlorine, nitrogen and bromine, which acts as  catalysts, speeding up the removal process. CFCs are predominant. </p>

				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>The above combination of reactions  form a long chain, in which oxygen atoms are constantly being shuttled back and  forth between the various molecular forms. </li>
				    <li>The net effect of the above reactions  is the creation of a layer of ozone in the stratosphere that absorbs  biologically damaging UV radiation. </li>
				    <li>In addition, the heating that results  from this UV adsorption is what creates the temperature inversion in the  stratosphere, which produces stable conditions that lead to long residence  times for stratospheric pollutants. </li>
				    <li>As can be seen, the radiation reaching  the earth's surface is rapidly reduced for wavelengths less than about 320 nm. </li>
				    <li>The UV wavelength have been divided  into two bands designated as UV-A and UV-B, where UV-A corresponds to  wavelengths less than 320 nm. </li>
				    <li>The UV-A portion of the spectrum is  not carcinogenic at usual exposure levels on the earth's surface. The crucial  role played by ozone in reducing UV-B is apparent. </li>
				    <li>CFCs are very stable compounds in the  troposphere. When they drift to the stratosphere, CFC molecule can be broken by  UV radiation, freeing the chlorine, that is then available to destroy ozone.</li>
				    <li> The reaction involving CFC-12 for example is  CCl2F2 + hn                          Cl +  CClF2, where hn  represents solar radiation. </li>
				    <li>The chlorine freed acts as a catalyst  in the ozone removal process i.e. it contributes to the reaction, but is  unaffected by it. </li>
				    <li>A single chlorine  atom may break down 1, 00,000 ozone molecules, before it returns to the  troposphere, where it is rained out as hydrochloric acid. </li>
				    <li>Concern over possible destruction of  stratospheric ozone first expressed in the early 1970's (Molina and Rowland,  1974), but it was not until 1985, with the dramatic announcement of the  discovery of a 'hole' the ozone layer over Antarctica, the size of the  continental US, that the world began to acknowledge the seriousness  of the problem. </li>

				<p align="justify">The following set of reactions has been  proposed to describe the role of chlorine and CFCs in the creation of the  Antarctic ozone hole.<br />
				  Cl +  O3                  ClO + O2, which  reacts with nitrogen dioxide (NO2), to form a relatively inert  molecule of chlorine nitrate (ClONO2) :<br />
				  ClO  + NO2                            ClONO2</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>All  this point, the chlorine is effectively stored in an inactive form, unable to  destroy more ozone. </li>
				    <li>In  the Antarctic winter, however, a unique atmospheric condition known as the <br />
				      <em>polar vortex </em>traps air above the pole and creates conditions that  eventually allow the chlorine to be released. </li>
				    <li>The  polar vortex blocks warmer mid-latitude air from mixing with the air above the  pole, creating extremely cold polar air temperature. </li>
				    <li>Stratospheric  temperatures may fall below – 90°C, which is cold enough to form polar  stratospheric clouds even though the air is very dry. </li>
				    <li>The  ice crystals that make up polar clouds play   a key role in the Antarctic phemomenon. </li>
				    <li>By  providing reaction surfaces, these ice crytals allow  chlorine nitrate to react  with water to form hypochorous  acid (HOCL) </li>

				    <li> The destruction of ozone, as the sun first  appears in the Antarctic  spring,  proceeds as described until the nitric acid formed (H2O + ClO2                   HOCl + HNO3)  photolyses, creating NO2 that ties up chlorine.

				<p align="justify">Since  ozone absorbs biologically damaging UV radiation before it can reach the  earth's surface, ozone destruction increase the risks associated with UV  exposure. UV radiation is linked with human skin cancer, cataracts and  suppression of immune system response. Moreover, many plants and aquatic  organisms have been shown to be adversely affected by increases in UV exposure.  And finally, increases in terrestrial UV flux could increase urban air  pollution through the photolysis of formaldehyde, a common component of  photochemical smog. Sunburn, Cataract, aging  of the skin and skin cancer are caused by increased UV radiation. It weakens  the immune system by suppressing the body’s resistance to certain infections  like measles, chicken pox and other viral diseases that elicit rash and  parasitic diseases such as Malaria introduced through skin.  It affects the ability of plants to capture  light energy during the process of photosynthesis. This reduces the nutrient  content and the growth of plants. This is especially seen in legumes and  cabbage. Zooplanktons and phytoplanktons are damaged by UV. UV exposure  shortens the breeding period of Zooplanktons. As planktons from the basis of  the marine food chain, any change will influence the fish and shellfish  production.</p>
