				<p align="justify">Variation  is the law of nature. It occurs everywhere and every moment. The variations  take place at micro levels. The variations may be linear or cyclic. The variety  and variability of organisms and ecosystems is referred to as biological  diversity. The world Commission on Environment and Development (WCED)  constituted by the UN General Assembly published a report in 1987 which  provided a boost and endorsement to the need for conserving the world’s rich  biodiversity. Despite conflicting views among nations, a broad consensus was  reached after bitter negotiations, and 170 countries signed the Biodiversity  Convention, which is now ratified by 104 countries.<br />
				  Perhaps the greatest value of  biodiversity is yet unknown. Scientists have discovered and named only 1.75  million species – less than 20 per cent of those estimated to exist. Of those  identified, only a fraction has been examined for potential medicinal,  agricultural or industrial value. Much of the earth’s great biodiversity is  rapidly disappearing, even before we know what is missing. Estimates vary, but  the most widely accepted figure lies between 10 and 13 million species. Of  these, biologists estimate that as many as 27,000 species are becoming extinct  each year. This translates into an astounding 3 species every hour.<br />
  <strong>Types  of Biodiversity (Diversity Indices):</strong><br />
  <strong>Alpha  (</strong><strong>a</strong><strong> ) Diversity : </strong>Species diversity within a community or  habitat, comprises two components i.e. species richness and evenness. Sometimes  dominant of one vegetation stratum may affect the α diversity of the other  strata.<br />
  <strong>Beta (β) Diversity : </strong>β  diversity is the inter community diversity  expressing the rate of species turnover per unit change in habitat.<br />
  <strong>Gamma (</strong><strong>g</strong><strong>)  Diversity :</strong>    Gamma  diversity is the overall  diversity at  landscape level includes both α and<strong> </strong>β diversities. The relationship is  as follows:<br />
				  γ  = <strong>a</strong><strong> + β</strong> + Q<br />
				  where, Q =   Total number of habitats or communities,   <strong>a</strong> =   Average value of α diversities<br />
				  <strong>β</strong>  =    Average value of β diversities<br />
  <strong>Levels  of Biodiversity</strong><br />
				  Theoretically there are three  levels of biodiversity.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong>Genetic diversity</strong></li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">It refers to the variation of genes within the  species. This constitutes distinct population of the same species or genetic  variation within population or varieties within a species.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong>Species diversity </strong></li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">It refers to the variety of species within a  region. Such diversity could be measured on the basis of number of species in a  region.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong>Ecological diversity</strong></li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">Ecological diversity is the intricate network  of different species present in local ecosystem and the dynamic interplay  between them. An ecosystem consists of organisms from many different species  living together in a region that are connected by the flow of energy,  nutrients, and matter that occurs as the organisms of different species  interact with one another.<br />
                    <strong>The Mega  Diversity Regions</strong> <br />
				  The World Conservation Monitoring Centre  recognised 17 mega diverse countries in July 2000 including Australia, Brazil,  China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (formerly Zaire),  Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mexico, Papua New Guinea,  Peru, the Philippines, South Africa, the United States of America (USA) and  Venezuela. Together, these 17 countries harbour more than 70% of the earth's  species.  Some of  the very valuable “gene pool” from these countries have been identified and  they have been utilized for the built up of modern agriculture and allied  business.<br />
  <strong>Hotspots of  Biodiversity</strong> <br />
				  The earth’s biodiversity is located in specific  ecological regions. There are over a thousand major ‘ecoregions” in the world.  Of these,200 are said to be richest, rarest and most distinctive natural areas.  These areas are reffered to as the ‘Global 200’.<br />
				  It has been estimated that 50,000  endemic plants, which comprise 20% of global plant life, probably occur in only  18 ‘hot spots’ in the world. Countries have a relatively large proportion of  these biodiversity hotspots are referred as ‘mega-diversity nations’.<br />

                    <strong>India's  biodiversity</strong><br />
				  India is exceptionally rich in biodiversity  and is one of the twelve mega diversity centres of the world. With 10  biogeographic zones and 25 biotic provinces, all major ecosystems are  represented. India is a land mass of nearly 33 lakh sq.km with a coastline of  7,616 km and 14 different types of climatic forests and the total forest  coverage in India is about 6,50,000 sq.km. India is the home land of 13,000  species of flowering plants, 20,000 species of fungi, 50,000 species of  insects, 65,000 species of fauna including 2000 species of birds, 350 mammals  and 420 of reptiles. It covers nearly 7% of world’s flora and 6.5% of world’s  fauna of which 33 % flora and 62% fauna are endemic. India has over 30 National  parks that constitute about 1% of the landmass and 441 sanctuaries that  constitute 3.5% of the area. India is a home of over 35,000 tigers and the  umbrella of project tiger 23 specially demarcated project tiger reserves  covering 33,000 sq.km representing different climatic forests are spread across  the country.<br />
				  India has a rich and varied heritage of  biodiversity, encompassing a wide spectrum of habitats from tropical  rainforests to alpine vegetation and from temperate forests to coastal  wetlands. <strong>India figured with two  hotspots</strong> - the Western Ghats and the Eastern Himalayas - in an  identification of 18 biodiversity hotspots carried out in the eighties.  Recently, Norman Myers and a team of scientists have brought out an <strong>updated list of 25 hotspots</strong>. In the  revised classification, the 2 hotspots that extend into India are The Western  Ghats/Sri Lanka and the Indo-Burma region (covering the Eastern Himalayas); and  they are included amongst the top eight most important hotspots. In addition<strong>, India has 26 recognised endemic centres</strong> that are home to nearly a third of all the flowering plants identified and  described to date. <br />
				  Of the estimated 5–50 million species of the  world's biota, only 1.7 million have been described to date, and the  distribution is highly uneven. About seven per cent of the world's total land  area is home to half of the world’s species, with the tropics alone accounting  for 5 million. India contributes significantly to this latitudinal biodiversity  trend. With a mere 2.4% of the world's area, India accounts for 7.31% of the  global faunal total with a faunal species count of 89,451 species. Some salient  features of India's biodiversity have been mentioned below.</p>
				  <div align="justify">
				    <ul type="disc">
				      <li>India has two major realms called the       Palaearctic and the Indo-Malayan, and three biomass, namely the tropical       humid forests, the tropical dry/deciduous forests, and the warm       desert/semi-deserts</li>
				      <li>India has ten biogeographic regions       including the Trans-Himalayan, the Himalayan, the Indian desert, the       semi-arid zone(s), the Western Ghats, the Deccan Peninsula, the Gangetic       Plain, North-East India, and the islands and coasts. </li>
				      <li>As of date, there are 911 properties under the       World Heritage List, which cover 711 cultural sites, 180 natural sites and       27 mixed properties encompassing 152 countries, including India. India       is one of the 12 centres of origin of cultivated plants. </li>
				      <li>India’s first two sites inscribed on the list       at the Seventh Session of the World Heritage held in 1983 were the Agra       Fort and the Ajanta Caves. Over the years, 27 more sites have been       inscribed, the latest site inscribed in 2012 being the Western Ghats. Of       these 29 sites, 23 are cultural sites and the other six are natural sites.       A tentative list of further sites/properties submitted by India for       recognition includes 33 sites. </li>
				      <li>India has 17 biosphere reserves, and 19       Ramsar wetlands. Amongst the protected areas, India has 102 national parks       and 490 sanctuaries covering an area of 1.53 lakh sq. km. </li>
				      <li>The wildlife sanctuaries in India are home to       around two thousand different species of birds, 3500 species of mammals,       nearly 30000 different kinds of insects and more than 15000 varieties of       plants </li>
			        </ul>
			    </div>
			    <p align="justify">The endemism of Indian biodiversity is high.  About 33% of the country's recorded flora are endemic to the country and are  concentrated mainly in the North-East, Western Ghats, North-West Himalaya and  the Andaman and Nicobar islands. Of the 49,219 plant species, 5150 are endemic  and distributed into 141 genera under 47 families corresponding to about 30% of  the world's recorded flora, which means 30% of the world's recorded flora are  endemic to India. Of these endemic species, 3,500 are found in the Himalayas  and adjoining regions and 1600 in the Western Ghats alone. About 62% of the  known amphibian species are endemic with the majority occurring in the Western  Ghats. Nearly 50% of the lizards of India are endemic with a high degree of  endemicity in the Western Ghats. India is a centre of crop diversity - the  homeland of 167 cultivated species and 320 wild relatives of crop plants. <br />
				  Corals reefs in Indian waters surround the  Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the Lakshadweep Islands, and the Gulf areas of  Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. They are nearly as rich in species as tropical  evergreen forests. India's record in agro-biodiversity is equally impressive.  There are 167 crop species and wild relatives. India is considered to be the  centre of origin of 30,000-50,000 varieties of rice, pigeon-pea, mango,  turmeric, ginger, sugarcane, gooseberries etc and ranks seventh in terms of  contribution to world agriculture. <br />

				<p align="justify"><strong>Loss  of Biodiversity</strong><br />
				  With the current rate of  development, population growth and migration communities are increasingly  unable to meet their sustained needs. However, the present day drastic changes  in the environment and habitat due to population explosion and unmanaged  developmental activities are so unnatural that the species are not getting full  liberty of time and space for their survival and adaptive radiation, therefore,  resulting in loss of biodiversity, which is a global crisis. It is high time  that our natural wealth be preserved from loss.<br />
  <strong>Threats  to Biodiversity</strong><br />
				  The diversity in India i.e  .forests, grass lands, wetlands, mountains, deserts and marine ecosystems face  many pressures. One of the major causes for the loss of biological diversity in  India has been the depletion of vegetative cover in order to expand  agriculture. Since most of the biodiversity rich forests also contain the  maximum mineral wealth and also the best sites for water impoundment, mining  and development projects in such areas have often led to destruction of  habitats. Poaching and illegal trade of wildlife products too have adversely  affected biological diversity.<br />

				<p align="justify"><strong>Categories  of threat</strong><br />
				  The following categories of  threat have been recognized by IUCN (International Union for Conservation  of  Nature and Natural Resources) <br />
  <strong>1.  Endangered</strong><br />
				  The taxa in danger of extinction  and whose survival is unlikely, the causal factors continue operation. The taxa  whose number have been reduced to a critical level or whose habitats have been  so drastically reduced that they are seemed to be in immediate danger of  extinction (eg) <em>Nepenthes sp., Vanda, Cycas beddomii</em>.<br />
  <strong>2.  Vulnerable</strong><br />
				  Taxa likely to move into endangered  category in near future, if the causal factors continue operating included taxa  of which most or all the population are decreasing because of over  exploitation, extensive destruction of habitats or other environmental  disturbances. Eg. <em>Dioscoria deltoidea</em><br />
  <strong>3.  Rare</strong><br />
				  Taxa with small world population  that are not at present endangered or vulnerable but are at risk. These taxa  are usually localized within restricted geographical areas or habitat or are  thinly scattered over more extensive range (eg) <em>Rauvolfia serpentina</em><br />
  <strong>4.  Threatened</strong><br />
				  The term threatened is used in  the conservation for species which fall in one of the above three categories<br />
  <strong>Endangered  plant and animal species</strong></p>

  <strong>Conservation of Biodiversity</strong><br />
				  The very existence of human  being is threatened due to continuous loss of biodiversity. Tropical rain  forests have been the focal point of the debates on biodiversity conservation.  In fact, the rain forest covers only 7% of the earth’s geographical area but  supports more than half of the world’s identified species. Of these, 15 rain  forests have been identified as hot spots. Tropical deforestation will be the  single greatest cause of species extinction in the next century.<br />
  <strong>Strategies  of Conservation</strong><br />
				  Future  strategy for Conservation   has 4 goals</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ol start="1" type="1">
				    <li>Maintenance of adequate resources</li>
				    <li>Conservation of resources through       reduction in demand and achievement of greater end use</li>
				    <li>Maximum use of renewable resources</li>
				    <li>Reduction in dependency of non-renewable       resources</li>
			      </ol>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong><em>In  situ</em></strong><strong> strategy</strong><br />
				  This  strategy emphasizes on the conservation work at original site of biodiversity  i.e. in wild. Conservation of overall diversity of genes, populations, species,  communities and the ecological processes comes under this strategy. There are  37,000 protected area in the world (World Conservation Monitoring Centre ,  WCMC). India has 17 biosphere reserves, and 19 Ramsar wetlands. Amongst the  protected areas, India has 102 national parks and 490 sanctuaries covering an  area of 1.53 lakh sq. km. </p>
				<p align="justify"><strong><em>Ex  situ</em></strong><strong> Strategy</strong><br />
				  This strategy says that  conservation work should be done outside the natural habitat in form of  botanical and zoological gardens, conservation stand, seed and seedling banks,  pollen banks, germ plasm banks, tissue culture banks, gene and DNA banks etc.  In India, conservation of genetic diversity of cultivated plants and their wild  relatives is done by NBPGR (National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources).<br />
  <strong>Reduction  of Anthropogenic Pressure</strong><br />
				  Increasing population and it’s  demands pose remarkable threat to taxa important to human being. About 70% of  identified medicinal plants of Indian Himalaya are exposed to destructive  harvesting. Cultivation of such plants elsewhere would contribute to their  conservation.<br />
  <strong>Restoration  of endangered species</strong><br />
				  It is tough and difficult  strategy. It requires specific knowledge about species and its surrounding.  This strategy includes diagnosis of factors responsible for the decline of  species, habitat conservation, captive breeding and restriction of harvesting  etc. the strategy include:</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul type="square">
				    <li>Reintroduction programmes in the original       site of living</li>
				    <li>Augmentation programmes to increase the       existing population size and genetic diversity of a species </li>
				    <li>Introduction programmes for a new area.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Endemic  species</strong><br />
				  Endemic species are the plants,  which are limited in their distribution i.e. they are restricted to a small  area and are not found elsewhere in the world. Endemism of Indian biodiversity  is significant. About 4,900 species of flowering plants and 33% of the recorded  floras are endemic to the country. These are distributed over 141 genera  belonging to 47 families. These are concentrated in the floristically rich  areas of North East India, the western Ghats, North West Himalayas and the  Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The Western Ghats and the Himalayas have two of  the 18 hot spots identified in the world. It is estimated that 62% of the known  amphibian species are endemic to India of which   a majority occur in Western Ghats.   Endemism may be due to:</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul type="square">
				    <li>Poor adaptability of a species in a wide       range of ecology</li>
				    <li>Presence of some geographical barrier</li>
				    <li>Failure of dispersal of reproductive       organs</li>
				    <li>The species might have comparatively been       young and not have time to spread.</li>

                    <strong>Biosphere  Reserves</strong><br />
				  Biosphere  reserve programme was launched by UNESCO in 1971 under its MAB (Man and  Biosphere Programme). Biospheres  are sites where protection is granted not only to the flora and fauna of the  protected region, but also to the human communities who inhabit these regions,  and their ways of life.  Biosphere  reserves are sites established by countries and recognized under UNESCO's Man  and the Biosphere (MAB) Program to promote sustainable development based on  local community efforts and sound science. Currently there are 580 sites across  114 countries. The Indian government has established 17 <strong>Biosphere Reserves  of India. </strong>Seven of the seventeen biosphere reserves are a part of the World  Network of Biosphere Reserves, based on the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere (MAB)  Program list.<br />
