                <p align="justify">Women are part and parcel of  environment. Women have direct relationship with their immediate environment.  Regularly they collect water, fuel wood, foods like nuts, fruits, leaves, roots  etc. So women have closer vicinity with the flora and fauna of that region by  living with them. Women as a social category, perform multiple role. Certain  roles have been recognized universally. The physical differentiation between  men and women necessitates certain social arrangements for procreation and  rearing of children. Man created practices and customs which tied woman to  motherhood in a familial social responsibility. A set of norms were created to  curb her freedom, creative potential and suppress her in society.<br />
                  Women  experienced depending syndrome particularly dependency on father during  childhood, dependency on the husband in adulthood and dependency on the son in  old age. This made her position subordinate to man and easy exploitation women  bear and rear children but no proper care for her role of motherhood. Neglect  of mother and motherhood lead to maternity deaths, in human custom of female in  infanticide etc. Because of poor stimulation of living and economic  backwardness, women suffer from nutritional deficiency, during pregnancy and  lactation. So it is necessary that there women should be educated to bring them  out and should be provided with proper training to create suitable awareness and  insight into the new demands in the physical and social environment.<br />
  <strong>Woman welfare and development</strong><br />
  <strong>           </strong> Even through, the first five ‘’ Five year  plans’’ were focusing on women’s welfare, only from the sixth ‘Five year plan’  (1980-1985) on wards, women were recognized as separate target group involving  developmental planning activities. The 1991 census revealed that women  constitute 48.1 percent of the country’s population. Hence it is understood  that for the development of the nation backwardness of women has to be taken  care.<br />
  <strong>Women rights and privileges</strong><br />
  <strong>         </strong>     The constitution of India not only  guarantees equality for women, but also empowers state to adopt measures of  positive discrimination in favours of women in order to overcome their disadvantages  in socio economic, educational and political fields. There are many articles in  the constitution specifically encourages the development of woman in the  society.</p>

As  HIV infected person receives a diagnosis of AIDS after developing one of the  AIDS indicator illnesses. A positive HIV test result does not mean that a  person has AIDS. A diagnosis of AIDS is made by a physician using certain  clinical criteria, AIDS illness indicator.<br />

Nearly 90 % of  the people who are infected with AIDS live in developing countries. 13 % of  world’s population lives in Africa, almost all states of African countries were  affected by HIV. About 3 million people so far died due to HIV/AIDS in 2003.  AIDS is rapidly spreading in Eastern Europe and Asia. India ranks second in the  world with 5.1 million HIV/AIDS affected people. The percentage is lower than  Thailand, Myanmar and South Africa.<br />

For AIDS there  is no vaccine or no remedial medicines have been so far successfully discovered.  The AIDS patients have to undergo a gradual deterioration process to death.  Since the HIV affects the immune system by destroying the lymphocytes (White  Blood Corpuscles) count, the AIDS patient is highly vulnerable to any kind of  infection from cough, cold etc., to cancer, typhoid etc, and cannot be treated  through any kind of antibiotics or any other kind of drugs due to his shattered  immunity system. Finally the AIDS patient will become a prey to any one of the  severe kind of infections.<br />
                  The public should also be educated to treat  AIDS patients with sympathy and concern. Since AIDS patients with sympathy and  contact, people should be educated not to isolate them. Clinical and social  workers should be specially trained for the welfare activities of AIDS  patients. In the high school level itself, proper education regarding the  prevention of AIDS and the clinical and social aspects  of AIDS should be taught in the class rooms. </p>

                    <strong>Role of Information Technology In Environment and  Human Health</strong><br />
                  Today  is an information age and tremendous flow of information is emerging in all  fields throughout the world. Information in this competitive era is more  precious than life and without information one cannot live at all. India is  endowed with rich natural resources while facing the problems of poverty,  illiteracy, population growth , environmental degradation etc. It is creating  new possibilities to tackle these problems. <br />
                  Information technology has tremendous potential in the field of  environmental education and health as in any other field like business,  economics, politics, or culture. Development of internet facilities, World Wide  Web, geological information system (GLS) and information through satellites, has  generated a wealth of up-to-date information on various aspects of environment  and health. A number of software have been developed for environment and health  studies which are user friendly and can help an early learner in knowing and  understanding the subject.  Nowadays the volume of data being generated  from the environment is increasing manifold. The whole process of data  collection, storage, processing and retrieved has become an easy task due to  computerization. Lot of time saved and reduces his work through automation of  many tasks. </p>
