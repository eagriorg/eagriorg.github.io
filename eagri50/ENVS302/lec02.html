				  A  resource is anything needed by an organism or group of organisms. The sum of  all physical, chemical, biological and social factors, which compose the  surroundings of man, is referred as environment and each element of these  surroundings constitutes a resource on which man draws in order to develop a  better life. Resources which are not reproducible and are obtained from the  fenite non-living reserves are called non-renewable resources (eg.) Coal and  metals.<br />
				  Any material which can be transformed in a way  that it becomes more valuable and useful can be termed as a resource. Thus,  only part of our natural environment, such as land, water, air, minerals,  forest, rangeland, wildlife, fish or even human population that man can utilize  to promote his welfare may be regarded as a natural resource.       In the case of humans, a resource is any  form of energy of matter essential for the fulfillment of physiological,  socio-economic and cultural needs, both at the individual level and that of the  community.<br />
				  The five basic ecological  variables - energy, matter, space, time and diversity are sometimes combinedly  called natural resources.</p>

				<p align="justify"><strong>Land</strong><br />
				  The land although appears to be available  unlimited but, infact, its judicious use would limit the availability of this  indispensable life support system. In rural land use planning, concentration is  chiefly devoted to creating and developing more farmland by removing forests  and natural grasslands, channeling streams for irrigation and so on.  Unfortunately, no effort is made to save existing prime farmland from  degradation by ill planned development.<br />
				  A nation’s well-being is inextricably linked  with the fertility and abundance of soil resources. Productive land is since  the source of human sustenance and security everywhere at all times, this  resource because of mounting demands of swelling population and long  mismanagement would put in jeopardy the very survival of man.<br />
				  Deteriorating quality of urban and sub urban  environment is to a great extent the result of injudicious land use and is a  threat to the whole socio economic system. Major problems emerging out of abuse  of land in cities include unsafe and unhygienic dwellings and those in rural  areas are of erosion of soil and loss of fertility. While urban problems can be  prevented and cured by proper town planning and municipal facilities, the  problem relating to rural areas need long-term soil conservation programme.</p>
				<div align="justify"><img src="images/24235" /><img src="images/53456346" />
</div>
				<p align="justify">Soil consists of mineral and organic  matter, air and water. The proportions vary, but the major components remain  the same. Minerals make up 50 per cent of an ideal soil while air and water  make up 25 per cent each. Every soil occupies space. Soil extends down into the  planet as well as over its surface. Soil has length, breadth, and depth. The  concept that a soil occupies a segment of the earth is called the &quot;soil  body&quot;. a single soil in a soil body is referred to as a &quot;pedon&quot;.  The soil body is composed of many pedons and  thus called a &quot;polypedon&quot;.<br />
				  Every  soil has a profile or a succession of layers (horizons) in a vertical section  down into the non-soil zone referred to as the parent material. Parent  materials can be soft rock, glacial drift, wind blown sediments, or alluvial  materials. The nature of the soil profile is important for determining a soil's  potential for root growth, storage of water, and supply of plant nutrients.<br />

				<p align="justify">                Throughout  history, the progress of civilizations has been marked by a trail of wind-blown  or water-washed soils that resulted in barren lands. Continuing to use the soil  without appropriate soil conservation management is very destructive to the  environment. Protecting the quality of our nation's topsoil is largely within  human control. To many soil scientists, saving our soil is much more important  than saving oil, coal, or natural gas resources.<br />
                    <strong>Water Resources</strong><br />
				  Water is a vitally important substance in all parts of the environment. Water resources occupy a unique place among  other natural sources. It is the most abundant and most widely distributed  element in the world. It occupies about three fourths (70%) of the earth’s  surface.  It occurs in all  spheres of the environment – in the oceans as a vast reservoir of saltwater, on  land as surface water in lakes and rivers, underground as groundwater in the  atmosphere as water vapor, and in the polar icecaps as solid ice.  This  amounts to a staggering 1400 million cubic kilometer, which is enough to cover  the earth with a layer 3000 meters deep. This apparent abundance is, however,  misleading and hides an ironical fact which is not always fully appreciated, a  mammoth 97.5% of the amount, contained in the world’s oceans and seas, being  saline, is unfit for human consumption. We, like many creatures, require fresh  water to survive, and that constitute a miserly 2.5 % of the total amount. Of  this, about 68.9% lies inaccessible in ice fields and glaciers and another  29.9% is present as groundwater. In effect, only one – hundredth of three per  cent (0.03%) of the world’s total supply amounting to some 14 billion cubic meters  is considered easily available for human use on a regular basis. This water is found in decreasing order  of abundance in saline and freshwater lakes and reservoirs; as soil moisture;  as water held in living organisms, as vapor, droplets, and miniscule ice  crystals in the atmosphere; in swamps and marshes; and in rivers and  streams.  The problem would not have been so acute had freshwater  been evenly distributed around the globe, throughout the seasons or from year  to year. It is not so. Two thirds of the world’s population i.e around 4  billion people lives in areas receiving only one quarter of the world’s annual  rainfall. <br />
  <strong>Freshwater distribution</strong><br />
				  About three-quarters of annual  rainfall come down in areas containing less than one-third of the world’s population.  As water –short societies have done for centuries, many countries attempt to  move water from where it occurs on nature to where the people want it, and also  to store water for future use. Worldwide, there are 40,000 dams higher than 15  mts, most of them built in the last 50 years. Although dams help ensure a  steady water supply, they often endanger aquatic systems by blocking river  channels, altering water flows of rivers, food plains, deltas, and other  natural wetlands, as well as imperiling plant and animal life.<br />
  <strong>How water is used?</strong><br />
				  The amount of water that people  in a country actually use depends not only on minimum needs and how much water  is available for use but also on the level of economic development and the  extent of urbanization. Globally, of the three categories of freshwater use-  for agriculture, industry and domestic, agriculture dominates. On a worldwide  basis, agriculture accounts for about 69% of the annual water withdrawals;  industry, about 23% and domestic use, about 8%.<br />
  <strong>India’s Water Resources Potential</strong><br />
				  India receives an annual precipitation of  about 4000 cu.km. About 1869 cu.km occurs as natural run off in rivers. India  has 12 major rivers with a total catchments area of 252.8 million hectare. Of  these, the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghana system is the biggest with a catchment  area of about 110 m.ha. It also provides about 60% of the total amount of  freshwater amongst other rivers. Others with catchment areas of more than 10  m.ha are Indus (32.1 m.ha), Godavari (31.3 m.ha.), Krishna (25.9 m.ha.) and  Mahanadi (14.2 m.ha.) The national annual per capita availability of water in  the country is about 2208 cu.m.<br />
  <strong>Groundwater</strong><br />
				  In  India groundwater has been used for irrigation and domestic water supply since  time immemorial. At present, more than 70% of the population uses groundwater  for its domestic needs and more than half of the irrigation is provided from  this source. The total replenishable ground water in India is estimated to be  about 43.18850 million hectare meter per year. About 7.1 m ha m/yr is used for  domestic and industrial use. It is estimated that about 32.47264 m ha m/yr is  available for irrigation. About 32% of available groundwater resources have so  far been used. There is increasing extraction of groundwater to meet the  demands of the agriculture, especially for the cultivation of water intensive  crops, like sugarcane. Some 90% of the groundwater extracted is used for  irrigation. Today, more than 8.5 million electric and diesel pumps are used to  withdraw groundwater leading to falling water tables in most states.<br />
  <strong>Water scarcity</strong><br />
				  Years of rapid population growth  and increasing water consumption have strained the world’s freshwater  resources. In some areas the demand for water already exceeds nature’s supply,  and a growing number of countries are expected to face water shortages in the  near future.The world’s population, at 6.1 billion is growing by about 80  million people each year. This number implies an increased demand for  freshwater of about 64 billion cubic meters a year. A country is said to  experience water stress when annual water supplies drop below 1,700 cubic  meters per person. Below 1,000 cubic meters per person, the country faces water  scarcity. Once a country experiences water scarcity, it can expect chronic  shortages of freshwater that threaten food production, hinder economic growth  and development, and damage eco system.<br />
				  In 1995,  31 countries containing 458 million people faced either water stress or  scarcity. By 2025, according to projections made by Population Action  International, more than 2.8 billion people in 48 countries will be facing  water stress or scarcity. By 2050, the number of water short countries soars to  54, affecting 4 billion people, or 40% of the projected global population. The  worst hit areas are in the Middle East, North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa.  Over 200 million Sub Saharan Africans already live in water short countries.  This figure balloons to 700 million by 2025, of whom over half will live in  countries facing severe shortages for most of the year.</p>
				<p align="justify"><strong> World Water Demand/Year</strong><strong> </strong><br />
				  1940                                                       1000  km3 <br />
				  1990                                                       4130  km3 <br />
				  2000                                                       5000  km3 <br />
				  2002                                                       6650  km3 <br />
				  Water scarcity is now the single  biggest threat to food production, as falling groundwater levels and shrinking  rivers make less water available for agriculture. According to UNEP, India will  be water –stressed before 2025-with average annual water availability limited  to between 1000 cubic meters to 1700 cu. m per person.<br />

				<p align="justify">Management of water implies making the best  use available water resources for human benefit while not only preventing and  controlling its depletion and degradation but also developing it in view of the  present and future needs. Floods, droughts, improper use, pollution, disease  transmission are the important problems related to water. Pollution of a body  of water is detrimental not only to the human society but also to regional  ecology and the ecology of very aquatic system. It is therefore, essential that  the water should not be treated as a simple repository of waste disposal, and  if inevitable, the water only after proper treatment should be released in it  under strict ecological considerations.     <br />
                    <strong>Drought</strong><br />
				  Drought may be caused due to variability of  rainfall, delay in onset or early withdrawal of monsoon, duration of break in  the monsoon, area differences in persistence of monsoon and human activities.  Based on the physical characteristics, drought may be of meteorological  drought, hydrological drought, soil-moisture drought, agricultural drought,  socio-economic drought, famine and ecological drought.<br />
  <strong>Combating drought</strong><br />
				  Planning for drought includes;</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Scientific use of rainfall, surface  and underground water.</li>
				    <li>Introduction of proper cropping  pattern.</li>

				<p align="justify"><strong>Dams: </strong>Today  there are more than 45,000 large dams around the world, which play an important  role in communities that harness these water resources for their economic  development. Current estimates suggest that about 30-40 % of the irrigated land  worldwide relies on dams. The world’s two most populous countries China and  India – have built around 57% of the world’s large dams. In India, of the 16-18  million people displaced by dams, 40-50% wee tribal people, who account only for  8% of our nations one billion people.<br />
