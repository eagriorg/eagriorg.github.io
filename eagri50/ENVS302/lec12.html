				<p align="justify">The spontaneous  emission of particles and rays by an unstable nucleus is called Radioactivity  and such substances are called Radioactive Substances eg. Radium, Uranium,  Thorium. Radioactive pollution can be defined as the release of radioactive  substances or high-energy particles into the air water, or earth as a result of  human activity, either by accident or by design. Sometimes natural sources of  radioactivity, such as radon gas emitted from beneath the ground, are  considered pollutants when they become a threat to human health.  The sources of Radioactive wastes  are </p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Natural sources: Solar radiation,  Radionuclides in the earth Crust, Human Internal radiation, environmental  Radiations.</li>
				    <li>Anthropogenic Sources: The sources of  such waste include : 1) nuclear weapon testing or detonation; 2) the <em>nuclear  fuel cycle,</em> including the mining, separation, and production of nuclear  materials for use in nuclear power plants or nuclear bombs; (3) accidental  release of radioactive material from nuclear power plants..</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">                Since  even a small amount of radiation exposure can have serious (and cumulative)  biological consequences, and since many radioactive wastes remain toxic for  centuries, radioactive pollution in a serious environmental concern even though  natural sources of radioactivity far exceed artificial ones are present. The faster a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope" title="Radioisotope">radioisotope</a> is decaying, the more radioactive it will be. Another  factor in deciding how dangerous a pure radioactive substance will be is the  energy of the radiation. Some decays yield more energy than others. This is  further complicated by the fact that few radioisotopes decay immediately to a  stable state, but rather to a radioactive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_product" title="Decay product">decay product</a> leading to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_chain" title="Decay chain">decay chains</a>.<br />
				  Radioactive  pollution that is spread through the earth's atmosphere is termed <em>fallout</em>.  Such pollution was most common in the two decades following World War II, when  the United States, the Soviet Union, and Great Britain conducted hundreds of  nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere. France and China did not begin testing  nuclear weapons until the 1960s and continued atmospheric testing even after  other nations had agreed to move their tests underground.<br />
				  Three types of fallout result from  nuclear detonations: local, tropospheric and stratospheric. </p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <ul>
				      <li>Local  fallout is quite intense but short-lived. </li>
				      <li>Tropospheric  fallout (in the lower atmosphere) is deposited at a later time and covers a  larger area, depending on meteorological conditions. </li>
				      <li>Stratospheric  fallout, which release extremely fine particles into the upper atmosphere, may  continue for years after an explosion and attain a worldwide distribution. </li>

                    <strong>Types of radioactive waste:</strong><br />
                    <strong>Low  level Waste (LLW)</strong> is generated  from hospitals and industry, as well as the nuclear fuel cycle. It comprises  paper, rags, tools, clothing, filters etc which contain small amounts of mostly  short-lived radioactivity. It does not require shielding during handling and  transport and is suitable for shallow land burial. To reduce its volume, it is  often compacted or incinerated before disposal.<br />
                    <strong>Intermediate level Waste (ILW)</strong> contains higher amounts of  radioactivity and some requires shielding. It typically comprises resins, chemical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sludge" title="Sludge">sludges</a> and metal fuel cladding, as well  as contaminated materials from reactor decommissioning. It may be solidified in  concrete or bitumen for disposal. Generally short lived waste (mainly from  reactors) is buried in a shallow repository, while long lived waste (from fuel  reprocessing) will be disposed of deep underground.<br />
                    <strong>Transuranic Waste</strong> arises mainly from weapons  production, and consists of clothing, tools, rags, residues, debris and other  such items contaminated with small amounts of radioactive elements -- mostly  plutonium. These elements have an atomic number greater than uranium -- thus  transuranic (beyond uranium). Because of the long half-lives of these elements,  this waste is not disposed of as either low level or intermediate level waste.  It does not have the very high radioactivity of high level waste, nor its high  heat generation. The United States currently permanently disposes of  transuranic waste at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_Isolation_Pilot_Plant" title="Waste Isolation Pilot Plant">Waste Isolation Pilot Plant</a>.<br />
                    <strong>High level Waste (HLW)</strong> arises from the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a> fuel in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor" title="Nuclear reactor">nuclear  reactor</a> and nuclear weapons processing. It contains the fission  products and transuranic elements generated in the reactor core. It is highly  radioactive and hot. It can be considered the &quot;ash&quot; from  &quot;burning&quot; uranium. HLW accounts for over 95% of the total  radioactivity produced in the process of nuclear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation" title="Electricity generation">electricity  generation</a>.<br />
                    <strong>Waste Stored Safely Now</strong></p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>After it is removed from the reactor, used fuel is stored  at nuclear plant sites in steel-lined, concrete vaults filled with water. </li>
				    <li>The water cools the used fuel and acts as a shield, to  protect workers from radiation. </li>
				    <li>This used fuel looks just like it did when it was placed  in the reactor. </li>
				    <li>The radioactive waste remains locked inside the uranium  pellets, which are still encased in the metal fuel rods.</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">This used fuel has been stored safely at nuclear  plant sites ever since the late 1950s, when the first nuclear power plants  began making electricity. What is needed is a permanent repository for existing  and future high-level waste.  Initially, it was thought that spent fuel rods could be  reprocessed  and only to provide new fuel  but also to reduce the amount of nuclear waste. However the cost of producing  fuel rods by reprocessing was found to be greater than the cost of producing  fuel rods from ore. Presently, India does operate reprocessing plants to  reprocess spent fuel as an alternative to storing them as nuclear waste. At  each step in the cycle, there is a danger of exposure to harmful radiation to  possess several health and environmental concerns.<br />

			    </div>
				<p align="justify"> In these two pollutions, pollution hazards  finally enter into the food chain the human who is the final victim of  radioactive pollution as he is at the end of all reactions and interactions.<br />
                    <strong>Effects of radioactive pollution:</strong><br />
				  The  effect of radioactive pollution depends upon </p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Half –life</li>
				    <li>Energy releasing capacity</li>
				    <li>Rate of diffusion</li>

				    <li>Various atmospheric and climatic  conditions such as wind, temperature, rainfall also determine their  effects.  </li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify">The  possible general effects of radioactive wastes are categorised into </p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Somatic Effect</li>
				    <li>Genetic Effect</li>
				    <li>Biomagnification</li>
			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Somatic  effect: </strong>Affects somatic cells. It appears  within individual and disappears with the death of the individual.<br />

			      </ul>
			    </div>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Radioactive Pollution  Incidents:</strong><br />
				  The two best  known examples illustrating the effect of fallout contamination are the bombing  of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan in 1945, and the Chernobyl Nuclear Power  Station disaster in April 1986. Within five years of the American bombing of  Japan, as many as 225,000 people had died as a result of long-term exposure to  radiation from the bomb blast, chiefly in the form of fallout.<br />
				  The  disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station in Ukraine on April 26, 1986  produced a staggering release of radioactivity. In ten days at least 36 million  curies spewed across the world. The fallout contaminated approximately 1,000  square mites (2,590 sq. km) of farmland and villages in the Soviet Union. In  addition to the hundreds killed at the time of the explosion, scientists  predict the eventual Soviet death toll from the Chernobyl accident is around  200,000; the estimated mortality in western Europe may be around 40,000.<br />
  <strong>Control of Radioactive pollution</strong><br />
				  The main objective in managing and disposing of  radioactive (or other) waste is to protect people and the environment. This  means isolating or diluting the waste so that the rate or concentration of any  radionuclides returned to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a> is harmless. To achieve this for  the more dangerous wastes, the preferred technology to date has been deep and  secure burial. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmutation" title="Transmutation">Transmutation</a>, long-term retrievable storage,  and removal to space have also been suggested.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>Nuclear devices should never be  exploded in air. If these activities are extremely necessary they should be  exploded underground.</li>
				    <li>In nuclear reactions, closed-cycle coolant  system with gaseous coolants of very high purity may be used to prevent  extraneous activation products.</li>
				    <li>In nuclear and chemical industries,  the use of radio-isotopes may be carried under a set of soil or water instead  of power or gaseous forms.</li>
				    <li>In Nuclear mines, wet drilling may be  employed along the underground drainage.</li>
				    <li>Nuclear reactors must be enclosed in  broad concrete walls to prevent the radiations that emerge out.</li>
				    <li>Workers should wear protective  garments and glass spectacles should be screened from radiation.</li>
				    <li>Extreme care should be exercised in  the disposal of industrial waste contaminated with radionuclides. The spend  rods are very radioactive containing about 1% U 235 and 1% plutonim.</li>

				<h1 align="justify">Effects  of industrial effluents</h1>
				<p align="justify">                Industries  need a wide variety of raw materials and chemicals which are later discharged  as effluents. Acids, alkalis, toxic metals, pesticides and other poisonous  substances such as cyanide, dyes, oils, detergents, resins, rubbers are a few  to mention. Heated effluents that impart thermal loading on receiving waters  and effluents containing radio active materials are also of prime concern. Some  of the effluents such as from tanning and meat packing may also contain  pathogenic bacteria. The nature and extent of pollution depends on the  materials present in the effluent and on the quantity discharged. <br />
                    <strong>Effects on water courses</strong><br />
				  <strong>Color  : </strong>The effluents contain dyes in higher concentrations which impart color to  the receiving streams and they persist for longer distances. Photosynthesis of  phytoplankton is affected by these colors. <br />
  <strong>pH value : </strong>The  extreme alkalinity makes the receiving water unfit for any purpose. Further, it  is deleterious to most of the aquatic life. <br />
  <strong>Suspended impurities : </strong>The  colloidal and suspended impurities produce turbidity in the receiving waters.  The turbidity and color along with the oil and scum create an unsightly  appearance. <br />
  <strong>Depletion of oxygen : </strong>Natural  substances such as starch and dextrin and inorganic substances such as sulfide  and nitrite present in the effluent exert an immediate oxygen demand. The  stream will then be devoid of oxygen and the aquatic life are affected  adversely. <br />
  <strong>Toxic substances : </strong>Chromium,  sulfide, chlorine and aniline dyes present in these wastes are directly toxic  to fish and microbial organisms which carryout purification. Thus the self  purification of the water body is affected. <br />
  <strong>Oils : </strong>Various  oils (mineral) in the effluent interfere with the oxygenation of stream as they  form a blanket on the surface and prevents the entry of oxygen at air/water  interface. <br />
  <strong>Dissolved minerals : </strong>The  mineral materials, mostly sodium salts increase the salinity of the water and  consequently it becomes unfit for irrigation. </p>
				<h1 align="justify"> Effects on land</h1>
				<p align="justify">1.    The  excess content of sodium (60%) and boron (2 mg/l) are deleterious to crops. <br />
				  2.    The  high sodium alkalinity combined with salinity impairs the growth of plants. <br />
				  3.    Texture  of the soil is affected by sodium and penetration of roots is prevented. <br />
				  4.    Soil  permeability is also affected by sodium and ultimately the soil will lose its  productivity. <br />
				  5.    Suspended  and colloidal impurities clog the pores and form a mat on the surface of soil  preventing the passage of air, water etc. <br />

				<p align="justify"><strong>Effect  of Solid waste</strong><br />
				  Any  material that is thrown away or discarded as useless and unwanted is considered  as solid waste.  At first glance, the  disposal of solid waste may appear to be a very simple and mundane  problem.  In this age of lasers,  microcomputers, and space flight, it hardly seems possible that garbage  disposal should present any great challenge.   But many factors make solid waste disposal a complex problem of huge  proportions for a modern industrial society. </p>
				<h2 align="justify">Classification of solid wastes</h2>
				<p align="justify">Domestic and  municipal wastes:  These  include garbage and rubbish, like waste paper, plastic, cloth from households,  office, hostel and market. <br />
                    <strong>Industrial wastes:</strong>  The two general categories are process and  non-process wastes.  The non-process  wastes are common to all industries such as packaging, office and cafeteria  wastes.  Process wastes are more complex  and specific to the industrial plants.   Their composition depends on type of products produced.<br />
                    <strong>Agricultural wastes</strong>:  These include cereal and millet straw, paddy  husk, sugarcane trash and other crop residues. <br />
                    <strong>Special wastes:</strong> The waste  materials which endanger public health and welfare and seriously affect  environment are :  a) Radioactive wastes  from atomic power stations, labs and hospitals b) Toxic wastes such as  pesticides, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals c) Biological products such as  antibiotics, enzymes, pathogens. <br />
                    <strong>Auxiliary operations necessary for solid waste  treatment</strong>  <br />
				  i)             Transport and handling<br />
				  ii)            Pulverization<br />
				  iii)           Compaction<br />
  <strong>Transport and handling</strong><br />
				  Solid  wastes are collected from source, transported in trucks with hydraulic and  pneumatic system to a central place and to compact the waste to a high density,  for disposal.</p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Pulverization</strong><br />
				  Pulverization  of solid wastes is carried out prior to loading, land filling, compacting or  incineration to facilitate these processes.    Taw roll, impact and gyratory crushers and hammer mills are used for  pulverization.  It makes the solid waste  homogenous and helps in greater initial settlement.  The land can be more easily reclaimed and  built on.<br />
  <strong>Compaction</strong><br />
				  Compaction  and balling of solid wastes using hydraulic or pneumatic processes lead to  reduction in refuse volume, reduction in collection and transport time and  cost, lesser storage area and safety hazards and cleaner storage area.<br />
				  The  most effective way to ameliorate the solid waste disposal problem is to reduce  the generation and toxicity of waste.   But, as people search for better life and higher standard of living they  tend to consume more goods and generate more wastes. Consequently society is  searching for improved methods of waste management and ways to reduce the  amount of waste management system.  This  consists of reducing the amount of toxicity of the wastes at the source,  recycling, reusing or composting as much of the waste as is economically  reasonable. Burning the waste that cannot be economically recycled to generate  heat reduces the need for fossils and nuclear fuels. <br />
				  Recycling  and waste reduction play an important part in any waste management  strategy.  But engineering analysis  clearly shows that these options alone cannot solve the solid waste problem. At  the same time, according to best estimates, it may be possible to reach  recycling technologies that must be developed, additional markets must be  found, and industry must produce more products that are easy to recycle.  All the same, even if all of these steps are  successfully taken more than 160 million tons of solid waste still have to be  treated by other means, such as waste – to – energy combustion and land  filling. <br />
  <strong>Technologies  in solid waste management</strong><br />
				  Solid  waste management is a difficult process because it involves many  disciplines.  These include, technologies  associated with the control of generation, storage, collection, transfer and  transportation, processing, marketing, incineration and disposal of solid  wastes.  All of these processes have to  be carried out within existing legal and social guidelines that protect the  public health and environment and are aesthetically acceptable.  They must be responsive to public attitudes  and the disciplines included in the disposal process include administrative,  financial, legal, architectural, planning and engineering functions.  For successful integrated solid waste  management plant, it is necessary that all these disciplines communicate and  interact with each other in a positive interdisciplinary relationship .The  various techniques employed in solid waste management include, <br />
				  1)    Composting<br />
				  2)    Sanitary  land filling (Controlled tipping)<br />
				  3)    Thermal  process (Incineration and pyrolysis)<br />
				  4)    Recycling  and reuse<br />
  <strong> COMPOSTING</strong><br />
				  It  is being increasingly realized that composting is an environment friendly  process to convert wide variety of wastes into valuable agricultural  inputs.  This process minimizes the  environmental problems.  Composts are  excellent source of humus and plant nutrients, the application of which  improves soil biophysical properties and organic matter status of the soil.  Composting can be defined as the biological conversion of organic wastes into  an amorphous dark brown to black colloidal humus like substance under  conditions of optimum temperature, moisture and aeration.  Nutrient content of compost depends largely  on the nutrient content of the wastes. Composting is a process in which the  organic portion of solid waste is allowed to decompose under carefully  controlled conditions.   It is a  biological rather than a chemical or mechanical process; decomposition and  transformation of the waste material are accomplished by the action of  bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms.   <br />
				  With  proper control of moisture, temperature, and aeration, a composting plant can  reduce the volume of raw organic material by as much as 50 per cent.  In addition,    composting can stabilize the waste and produce an end product that may  be recycled for beneficial use.   The end  product is called <strong>compost</strong> or <strong>humus</strong>.  It resembles potting soil in texture and  earthy odor, and it may be used as a soil conditioner or mulch.<br />
				  A  complete municipal solid waste (MSW) composting operation includes sorting and  separating, shredding and pulverizing, digestion, product upgrading, and  finally marketing. Sorting and separation operations are required to isolate  organic, decomposable waste materials from the plastic, glass, metal, and other  non biodegradable substances.   Solid  waste sorting and separation methods are a key part of MSW recycling  operations. <br />
				  Shredding  and pulverizing serve to reduce the size of the individual pieces of the  organic waste, resulting in a relatively uniform mass of material.  This facilitates handling, moisture control,  and aeration of the decomposing waste.   Size reduction also helps optimize bacterial activity and increases the  rate of decomposition.  After size  reduction, the wastes are ready for the actual composting or digestion  step.  Digestion may take place in open  windrow or in an enclosed mechanical facility.<br />
				  A  windrow is a long, low pile of the prepared organic waste, usually about 3m (10  ft) wide at the base and about 2 m (6 ft) high.   Most windrows are conical in cross section and about 50 m (150 ft) in  length.  The composting waste is aerated  by periodically turning each windrow.   Turning frequency varies with moisture content and other factors.  When moisture content is maintained at about  50 per cent, windrows are turned two or three times a week and in some cases  daily.<br />
				  Generally,  open – field windrow composting takes about 5 weeks for digestion or  stabilization of the waste material.  An  additional 3 weeks may sometimes be required to ensure complete stabilization.  Temperatures in an aerobic compost windrow may reach 65oC (150oF) because of the natural  metabolic action of thermophilic microbes that thrive at such elevated  temperatures. The relatively high temperatures destroy most of the pathogenic  or disease-causing organisms that may be present in the waste.<br />
				  Open-field  windrow composting requires relatively large land areas. To reduce land  requirements, various types of enclosed mechanical systems can be used in lieu  of the open-field method.  A variety of  mechanical type compost systems are available.   Oxygen is supplied to the waste material by forced aeration, stirring,  or tumbling. In addition to reducing land requirements, enclosed mechanical  compost facilities can reduce the time required for stabilization from about 5  weeks to about 1 week.<br />
				  Composting is the aerobic, thermophilic  degradation of organic matter present in the refuse by microbes, predominantly  by fungi and actinomycetes, which are favoured by semi moist condition that  prevail in the process.  The control  parameters for optimum composting include, temperature (40oC), moisture  (40.7%), pH (4.5 – 9.5), nutrients (C:N ratio 40:1);  C:P ratio (100:1), air (0.5 – 0.8 m / d / kg  volatile solid) and particle size (6-25 mm).<br />
				  The digestion of the waste is carried  out naturally in an outside decomposition area in windrows (for five weeks) or  in mechanized composting plants  (for 4  to 6 days). In natural system, the garbage is mixed with nutrient source  (sewage sludge / animal manure) and a filler (wood chips) to provide entry of  air.  The mixture is turned over twice a  week and the process is completed in 4-6 weeks. The darkening of refuse, fall  in temperature and a musty odour indicate completion of the process.<br />
				  Before  the stabilized compost or humus can be sold for use as a mulch or soil  conditioner, it must be processed further to upgrade or improve its quality and  appearance.  This includes drying,  screening, and granulating or pelletizing.   Sometimes, the compost is placed in bags, although bulk sale is more  efficient and economical. Compost can increase the organic and nutrient content  of soil and improve its texture and ability to retain moisture.<br />
  <strong>Co-Composting</strong><br />
				  An  interesting example of integrated waste management is co-composting of  municipal solid waste and sewage sludge.   Sewage sludge adds nitrogen, phosphorous, and other elements that enrich  the solid waste and help the composting process.  The sludge is first dewatered so that it does  not add too much moisture to the compost pile.   The dewatered sludge and organic portion of MSW must be thoroughly  mixed.  At a time when ocean disposal of  sludge has been banned and sludge incinerators meet with much public  opposition, co-composting may offer an increasingly viable technique for  processing both sludge and MSW organics prior to final disposal. <strong></strong><br />
  <strong>Vermicomposting</strong><br />
				  The key role of earthworms in  improving the soil fertility is well known for a longer period.  Earthworms feed on any organic wastes,  consume three to five times their body weight and after using 5 to 10 per cent  of the organic wastes for their growth, excrete the mucus coated undigested  matter as worm casts.   Worm casts  consist of organic matter that has undergone physical and chemical breakdown  through the activity of the muscular gizzard, that grinds the material to a  particle size of 1-2 micron.  The nutrients  present in the worm casts are readily soluble in water for the uptake of  plants.  Vermicastings are rich sources  of macro and micronutrients, vitamins, enzymes, antibiotics, growth hormones  and immobilized micro flora.<br />
  <strong>Vermicompost </strong>refers  to organic manure produced by earthworms.   It is a mixture of worm castings, including humus, live earthworms,  their cocoons and other micro organisms.   Vermicomposting is an appropriate method for disposal of non-toxic solid  and liquid organic wastes.  It helps in  cost effective and efficient recycling of animal wastes (Poultry droppings,  horse, piggery excreta and cattle dung), agricultural residues and industrial  wastes using low energy.</p>
				<h2 align="justify">Types of earthworms</h2>
				<p align="justify">                Several types of earthworms are  found in our soils.  Earthworms can be  divided into the following two categories:<br />
				  1.    Epigeic – the surface living worms<br />
				  2.    Endogeic – the burrowing worms<br />
  <strong>Epigeic:</strong>  These worms are found on the surface and are  reddish brown in colour.  They do not  process the soil but are efficient in composting of organic wastes.  They enhance the rate of organic manure  production through biodegradation or mineralization.<br />
				  eg. <em>Lampito mauritii, Octochaetona serrata,  Perionyx excavatus</em></p>
				<p align="justify">Endogeic: These species burrow and mix the soil,  from different horizons in the profile.   They ingest organic and mineral fraction of soil, thus promoting the  formation of organo mineral complexes.   Organo – mineral crumbs are brought from deeper parts of the soil  profile to the surface.  Different  species of earthworms show specificity to soil types, moisture content and  temperature. Method of vermicomposting </p>
				<p align="justify">•              Selection of  earthworm:  Earthworm that is native to  the local soil may be used<br />
				  •              Size of pit:  Any convenient dimension such as 2m x 1m x 1m may be prepared<br />
				  •              Preparation of  vermibed: A layer, 15-20 cm thick of good loamy soil above a thin layer of  (5 cms) broken bricks and sand should be  made. <br />
				  •              Inoculation of  earthworms:   About one hundred  earthworms are introduced as an optimum inoculating density into a compost pit  of about 2m x 1m  x 1m, provided with  vermibed<br />
				  •              Organic  layering:   It is done on the vermibed  with fresh cattle dung.  The compost pit  is then layered to about 5 cm with dry leaves or hay or organic wastes.   Moisture content of the pit is maintained by  the addition of water. <br />
				  •              Wet organic  layering:  It is done after four weeks  with moist green organic waste, which can be spread over it to a thickness of 5  cm.  This practice can be repeated every  4 days.  Mixing of wastes periodically  without disturbing the vermibed ensures proper vermicomposting.  Wet layering with organic wastes can be  repeated till the compost pit is nearly full.<br />
  <strong>Harvesting of compost</strong>:   At maturation (after 120 days), the moisture  content is brought down, by stopping the addition of water. This ensures drying  of compost and migration of worms in to the vermibed.  The mature compost, a fine loose granular  mass (about 1500 kg), is removed from the pit, sieved, dried and packed.  Matured vermicompost is rich in nutrients and  recommended @ 50 t ha-1. <br />

				<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Sanitary land filling (Controlled tripping)</strong><br />
				  Land  filling is the most common and economic method of solid waste disposal.   The indiscriminate land filling of solid  waste in open dumps without adequate control and consideration of sanitation  and public health as generally followed in India is dangerous.  It results in water pollution, bad odour,  fire and breeding of flies and rats. <br />
				  It  should be replaced by sanitary land filling or controlled tipping.  The construction of sanitary land filling  includes:<br />
				  1)    Deposition  of solid waste in such a way to have a working force of minimum area.<br />
				  2)    Spreading  and compaction of waste in thin layers<br />
				  3)    Covering  of the waste with a layer of compacted cover soil daily.<br />
				  4)    Final  cover of the entire construction with compacted earth layer of 1.0 m thick. <br />
				  The solid wastes in sanitary land fill  are degraded by soil microbes.  In  comparison with other biological treatment systems such as activated sludge and  anaerobic digestion, the microbial degradation of solid waste proceeds at a  slow rate. <br />
  <strong>Thermal process</strong><br />
  <strong>Incineration</strong><br />
				  Incineration  is a process of destruction of waste at high temperature.  The combustible wastes are converted through  controlled combustion to a  residue,  which contain no combustible matter.  If land suitable for solid waste (SW) land  filling operations is not available within economic haul distances, then  incineration is necessary.  The solid  waste is reduced in volume (80% - 90%) and height (98-99%). Incinerator can  accept toxic and industrial wastes of any size in solid or powdery form.  The other special wastes include hospital  wastes, putrifiable organic solids from slaughter houses. <br />
  <strong>Pyrolysis (Destructive distillation)</strong><br />
				  Pyrolysis  is the process of conversion of biomass into solid, liquid and gaseous  energy.   Pyrolysis results in the  chemical breakdown of organic carbon material into three basic components: 1)  gas phase containing mainly hydrogen, CO2, CO and CH4 2) tar or oil phase containing simple organic  acids, methanol and acetone and  3) char  phase made up of pure carbon and inert material.  Pyrolysis does not cause pollution of the  atmosphere and large quantities of potentially hazardous plastics could be  treated. <br />
				  There  is no single prescription for an integrated waste management program that  successfully works in every instance.   Each situation must be analyzed on its own merit, an appropriate  integrated waste management plan must be developed from hard data, and social  attitudes  and the legal frame work must  be taken into account.  The waste  management disposal field is in a constant state of flux and appropriate  solutions should be innovative, as well as technically and economically sound. <br />
  <strong>Sludge management</strong><br />
				  Suspended  solids removed from wastewater during sedimentation and then concentrated for  further treatment and disposal are called <strong>sludge </strong>or<strong> biosolids</strong>.  Even in fully aerobic waste treatment  processes in which sludge is repeatedly recycled, most of the sludge must  eventually be removed from the system. The task of treating and disposing of  this material is called <strong>sludge management</strong>. <br />
  <strong>Sludge characteristics</strong><br />
				  The  composition and characteristics of sewage sludge vary widely.   Since no two wastewaters are alike, the  sludges produced will differ.   Furthermore, sludge characteristics change considerably with time.  Wastewater sludge typically contains organics (proteins, carbohydrates, fats  oils), microbes (bacteria, viruses, protozoa), nutrients (phosphates and  nitrates), and a variety of household and industrial chemicals. The higher the  level of heavy metals and toxic compounds, the greater is the risk to humans and  the environment.  A key physical  characteristic is the solids concentration, because this defines the volume of  sludge that must be handled.<br />
				  Sludge  is treated prior to ultimate disposal for two basic reasons: <strong>volume  reduction </strong>and <strong>stabilization of organics</strong>.  Stabilized sludge does not have an offensive  odor and can be handled without causing a nuisance or health hazard.  A reduced sludge volume minimizes pumping and  storage requirements and lowers overall sludge-handling costs.                 Several processes are available  for accomplishing these two basic objectives.   They include sludge thickening, digestion, dewatering, and  co-composting.  Incineration is  considered as a final disposal option.<br />
  <strong>Sludge disposal</strong><br />
				  Widely  employed methods for final disposal of waste water sludge have included ocean  dumping, land filling, incineration, land application, and sale as fertilizer. <br />
  <strong>Effect  of hazardous wastes</strong><br />
  <strong> </strong>The World Health Organization (WHO) considers waste causing short  term hazards such as acute toxicity by ingestion, inhalation or skin absorption  , corrosivity or other skin or eye contact hazards or risk or fire and  explosion and wastes causing long term hazards including chronic toxicity upon  repeated exposure, carcinogenecity, resistant to detoxification process such as  biodegradation, the potential  to pollute  underground or surface water or aesthetically objectionable properties such as  offensive smell as “hazardous wastes”.<br />
				  The major hazardous wastes include,</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ol>
				    <li>Radionuclides</li>
				    <li>Xenobiotics</li>

				<p align="justify">        Industrial growth, economic  development, consumerisation indicate a country’s progress and life standard of  individuals. Industrial growth has brought along with new problems, too. Water  pollution, air pollution, land pollution, noise pollution, radioactive  pollution, solid wastes, depletion of resources, scarcity of good quality  water, spreading health hazards, are all the consequences of stupendous  industrial activities with less attention to its negative impacts on man and  his environment (Ramana, 1999). Nature’s built in mechanisms and self  regulation ability has been thrown out of gear by the quantity and complexity  of wastes generated by the modern society. As technological progress has  followed the industrial revolution, environmental problem solving must follow technological  progress. Industrial processes and products thereof both must become  environmentally friendly and least damaging.                   </p>
				<p align="justify">Hazardous  waste management is the most challenging task before the different  technologies. Although efforts are continuously on to improve upon the raw  material usage, processes and search for alternative eco friendly products, the  generation of hazardous wastes and their quantitative contribution requires to  be tackled.    </p>

				<p align="justify"><strong>Principles  of Biological Treatment methods</strong><br />
				  “<strong><em>Biostimulation</em></strong>” and “<strong><em>bioaugmentation</em></strong>” are the two main ways of initiating  biological treatment, particularly in land treatment for hazardous wastes.  Biostimulation makes use of existing microorganisms and makes conditions  favourable for their action by adjustment of nutrients, pH, temperature, growth  factors etc. Bioaugmentation involves externally introduced cultures pure or  mixed with specific degradation capacities. Bioaugmentation if done for  biodegradation, introduced microorganisms should able to remain viable, should  compete with the existing microorganisms. </p>
				<p align="justify">Genetic, biochemical and ecological ability of  microorganisms used plays important role in biodegradation. Although a faster  kinetic rate will mean a less expensive system, biomass with a slow specific  growth rate responds more favourably to shock loadings. Reactors are to be  designed so that microbiological systems are properly controlled under various  operating conditions to give effluents of acceptable quality. </p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Treatment systems </strong><br />
				  Suspended growth and fixed film are the two main  categories of treatment systems although combinations of them are widely  used.  Immobilised systems are less  sensitive to toxicity and have higher efficiency in degradation of hazardous  wastes. Fixed film systems are more stable due to a higher biomass  concentration and resistance to mass transfer. In fixed films, no wash out of  organisms occurs even if the growth rate of the organisms is greatly reduced.  Land treatment is the most widely used option to treat toxic wastes . </p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Microbial Cultures for  biodegradation</strong><br />
				  Biological  detoxification may be carried out using pure cultures or mixed cultures. Mixed  cultures have a potential advantage over pure cultures in the degradation of  toxic compounds in hazardous wastes. Mixed cultures are particularly useful  when complete degradation of toxic organics to CO2, CH4,  H2S, N2 etc. Enrichment and selection procedures are  useful in selecting mixed cultures carrying out degradation. </p>

  <strong>ii.  Concentration of waste chemicals</strong> <br />

Moreover , the combination of multiple activities in host that is easily and  inexpensively cultured to high cell densities would certainly reduce  fermentation costs.<br />
  <strong>Advantages  of <em>in situ</em> application:</strong></p>

				  <ol>
				    <li>It allows destruction of contaminants <em>in situ</em></li>
				    <li>Minimum risk, and environmental impact</li>

				<p align="justify"><strong>Engineering stress resistance</strong><br />
				  Microorganisms  used to remediate hazardous wastes are likely to be exposed to a wide variety  of environmental stresses . Stress factor can range from high concentration of  contaminants, toxic metals, or solvents; through extremes in pH , oxygen  tension , temperature , ionic strength, and nutrient concentrations; to  conditions of extremely low carbon and nutrient availability. Microorganisms  must adapt to these conditions to be able to effect remediation. In some cases  genetic engineering may be helpful in augmenting resistance to such stresses,  there by facilitating good performance of the degradative organism under  adverse conditions.</p>
				<p align="justify">                The  following is the list of <em>in situ</em> options with order of preference for  hazardous waste management.</p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ol>
				    <li>Eliminate hazardous waste generation at production process stage</li>
				    <li>Do recovery of constituents of hazardous waste</li>
				    <li>See if landfill is suitable and economical</li>
				    <li>Decompose the waste by physical / chemical/biological means</li>
				    <li>Immobilise the waste by solidification or encapsulation so that  landfill becomes acceptable.</li>
			      </ol>

				<p align="justify">                Improper  disposal of hazardous and toxic waste can cause serious damages to health and  environment. Recalcitrant, man made compounds and their products are of major  concern in this regard.  Bioremediation,  is one of the most effective innovative technologies to come along in this  century to treat these hazardous wastes. They offer complete destruction of  contaminants and can often be applied at a lower total cost, at a faster rate.  With the advancement of bioreactor designs, the use of genetically engineered  microbes, biodegradation technology has been successful in making its impact  felt on pollution abatement efforts.</p>
