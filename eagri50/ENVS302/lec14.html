Human beings interact both with the social world and nature.  Both, economic development and stable environment are required for the  continual improvement of lifestyle and living standards. But until now, the  development was human oriented and limited to rich nations.

                    <strong>                     </strong> Sustainable development also looks at the  equity between countries and continents, races and classes, gender and ages. It  includes social development and economic opportunity on one hand and the  requirements of environment on the other. It is based on improving the quality  of life for all, especially the poor and deprived within the carrying capacity  of the supporting ecosystems. It is a process which leads to a better quality  of life while reducing the impact on the environment. Its strength is that it acknowledges  the interdependence of human needs and environmental ... <br />
                  To  ensure sustainable development, any activity that is expected to bring about  economic growth must also consider its environmental impacts so that it is more  consistent with long term growth and development. Many ‘development projects’,  such as dams, mines, roads, industries and tourism development, have severe  environmental consequences that must be studied before they are even begun.  Thus for every project, in a strategy that looks at sustainable development,  there must be a scientifically and honestly done EIA, without which the project  must not be cleared. Large dams, major highways, mining, industry, etc. can  seriously damage ecosystems that support the ecological health of a region. <br />
                  Forests are essential for maintaining renewable resources, reducing  carbon dioxide levels and maintaining oxygen levels in the earth’s atmosphere.  Their loss impairs future human development. Loss of forests depletes  biodiversity which has to be preserved to maintain life on earth. Major heavy  industries if not planned carefully lead to environmental degradation due to  air and water pollution and generate enormous quantities of waste that lead to  long term environmental hazards. Toxic and Nuclear wastes can become serious  economic problems as getting rid of them is extremely costly.</p>
                <p align="justify">In  order to safeguard the existence of life and future of humanity, we have to  change our approach from unsustainable to sustainable development. A judicious  balance between developmental activities and environmental protection should be  assured. It is possible only trough sustainable development.<br />
