				<p align="justify"><strong>3.1. Forest:</strong><br />
				  It is a natural ecosystem having  multispecies and multiage trees as dominant community. Forest covers about  1/3rd of the earth’s land surface of which about 50% is occupied by tropical  forest. Thus forests are important in two ways ecologically and economically  important.<br />
				  Increased urbanization,  industrialization and mining have entailed indiscriminate felling of trees and  denudation of forests. The depleted forest wealth would simply deprive the man  of economic and environmental values offered by forest Thus,  forest ecology is a highly diverse and important branch of ecological study. <a name="Unique_aspects_of_forest_ecology" id="Unique_aspects_of_forest_ecology"></a>The presence of trees makes forest  ecosystems and their study unique.<br />
  <a name="Community_diversity_and_complexity" id="Community_diversity_and_complexity"></a><strong>Causes of Deforestation</strong><br />
				  Deforestation is a consequence of  over-exploitation of our natural ecosystems for space, energy and materials.  The basic reasons for such extensive deforestation are:<br />
  <strong>(1) Expansion  of Agriculture</strong>:<br />
				  Expanding agriculture is one of  the most important causes of deforestation. As demands on agricultural products  rise more and more land is brought under cultivation for which forests are  cleared, grass-lands ploughed, uneven grounds leveled, marshes drained and even  land under water is reclaimed. However, this expansion is usually marked with  more ecological destruction than rationality. Governments often distribute land  under forests to landless people, instead of redistributing already established  farm-lands, howsoever, wasteful, unequal and unjust the distribution of  ownership of land may be. During the process of clearing the land precious  timber is simply burned. Ghana's 80% forests have disappeared but only 15%  timber was harvested. Similarly in Brazil, little timber was extracted before  the forests were burned for clearing the land.<br />
  <strong> (2) Extension of Cultivation on Hill Slopes:</strong> <br />
				  Outside humid tropical zone, in  most of the third world countries, major forests often occur on hill tops and  slopes. Though agriculture has nearly always been concentrated on plains and  floors of valleys, farming on narrow flat steps cut one after another across  the slope or terrace farming is an age-old practice. It has never been  extensive because of the gruelling labour and low productivity. However, the  ever rising human numbers and their necessities have forced many to go up to  mountain slopes for cultivation. More and more slopes are cleared of plants,  steps carved out and against many odds cultivation is attempted. After a few  crops the productivity declines and torrential sub-tropical rains carry down  massive quantities of precious top soils to streams and rivers. While denuding  hill slopes, the silt and sediments settle further down raising stream bottoms  and river beds aggravating the flood situation.<br />
  <strong>(3) Shifting  Cultivation:</strong> <br />
				  Shifting cultivation or Jhum is  often blamed for destruction of forests. In fact it is poor fertility of soil  which has given rise to such a pattern of farming. A small patch of tropical  forest is cleared, vegetation slashed, destroyed and burned. Crops are grown as  long as the soil is productive, after which the cultivation is abandoned and  cultivators move on to fresh patch of land. The abandoned land was allowed to  lay fallow for long periods during which regrowth of vegetation took place and  natural ecosystem was restored. Shifting cultivators, therefore, worked in  harmony with nature. However, the demands of growing population have shortened  the fallow periods drastically. The soil is unable to regain its fertility  before it is put to use again.<br />
  <strong> (4) Cattle Ranching:</strong> <br />
				  Large areas of tropical forests in  North Eastern States have been cleared for use as grazing land to raise cattle  and agricultural purpose. The soil degenerates within a short span of time due  to over-grazing and massive soil erosion occurs.<br />
  <strong> (5) Firewood Collection</strong>:<br />
				  To majority of rural population  and a large number of people living in small towns and cities of developing countries,  the only fuel is wood which is burned to cook food and to provide heat in  chilly winters. Firewood collection contributes much to the depletion of tree  cover, especially in localities which are lightly wooded. Denser forests  usually produce a lot of combustible material in the form of dead twigs, leaves  etc. There is hardly any need of cutting down live trees in densely wooded  localities. However, in the case of lightly wooded forests, where the pressure  of demand is usually higher, a slow thinning of woodland occurs due to regular  foraging of villagers. In Madhya Pradesh, India, a recent observation revealed  that felling of small trees for use as firewood and timber exceeds fresh plant  growth. In some places in the state, the Government! Allows people to collect  head loads of dead wood from forests for personal  use.<br />
  <strong> (6) Timber Harvesting:</strong> <br />
				  Timber resource is an important  asset for a country's prosperity. Commercial wood finds ready national as well  as international markets. As a consequence of which natural forests are being  mercilessly exploited. Logging or felling of forest trees for obtaining timber  is an important cause of deforestation in third world countries. Live trees  with thick and straight trunks are felled and transported to commercial  establishments elsewhere, to consumers who are ready to pay. In the process  large stretches of forests are damaged and the system which could have provided  resources worth much more to the local people is disrupted. Ironically the  profits from timber trade are enjoyed by Governments, large companies or  affluent contractors. Local people get a tiny share in the benefits while axing  their own resource base.<br />
				  Commercial logging in tropical  countries usually involves felling of trees of only selected species which  fetch better prices. This process of creaming or removing a few selected trees amidst  dense vegetation on rather a delicate soil causes much more destruction than  the actual number of trees or the volume of timber taken out would suggest. The  selective harvesting practiced by loggers leave many forests permanently  deficient in valuable plant species. Much of the West Africa has become useless  for commercial logging as important plant species required by the loggers are  not available. In Philippines, the valuable groups of tall trees (Dipterocarpus  sp.) have shrunk from original 16 million hectares in 1960, to about one  million hectares left standing in remote regions.<br />
				  The practice of cutting down  larger trees, of the selected species, leaving behind younger ones which can  grow into fresh stock to be harvested later may appear rational. In theory such  patch should become ready for reharvesting within thirty to forty years.  However, in practice none of the loggers leaves the required number of younger  trees and the notion that the woodland shall be ready for another valuable  timber harvest in forty years appears to be a wistful thinking at its best.</p>

				<p align="justify"><strong>Forest Management</strong><br />
				  Of various factors employed in forest  management, restrained felling, block and selective cutting, reforestation and  recycling of forest products are most important practices. <br />
  <strong>3.2. Wild life</strong><br />
				  It  was once customary to consider all undomesticated species of vertebrate animals  as wildlife. Birds and mammals still receive the greatest public interest and  concern, consistently higher than those expressed for reptiles and amphibians.  Most concern over fishes results from interest in sport and commercial value. The  tendency in recent years has been to include more life-forms under the category  of wildlife. Thus, mollusks, insects, and plants are all now represented on  national and international lists of threatened and endangered species.<br />
				  People  find many reasons to value wildlife. Virtually everyone appreciates the  aesthetic value of natural beauty or artistic appeal present in animal life.  Giant pandas, bald eagles, and infant harp seals are familiar examples of  wild-life with outstanding aesthetic value. Wild species offer recreational  value, the most common examples of which are sport hunting and bird watching.<br />
				  Less  obvious, perhaps, is ecological value, resulting from the role an individual  species plays within an ecosystem. Alligators, for example, create depressions  in swamps  and marshes. During periods of  droughts, these &quot;alligator holes&quot; offer critical refuge to  water-dependent life-forms. Educational and scientific values are those that  serve in teaching and learning about biology and scientific principles.<br />
				  Wildlife  also has utilitarian value which results from its practical uses. Examples of  utilitarian value range from genetic reservoirs for crop and livestock  improvement to diverse biomedical and pharmaceutical uses. A related category,  commercial value, includes such familiar examples as the sale of furs and  hunting leases.<br />
				  To define as the uncultivated  flora and the undomesticated fauna amongst the plants and animals or any form  existing in natural surroundings, Provides aesthetic, recreations and economic  benefits. For maintaining the balance of nature, wildlife plays an integral  part. In biodiversity of life forms, India is the 2nd largest country in the  world and Africa stands first.<br />
				  Wildlife includes 350 spp of mammals, 1200 spp of birds and more than  20,000 spp insect and countless number of plant species. Today wildlife species  are gradually disappearing and number is becoming reduced. Many species of  wildlife have become the way of extinction.</p>
				<p align="justify">Basic reasons for the extinction of  wildlife:<br />
				  i)       Destruction of their natural habitat due to  expanding agriculture, urbanization and industrialization.<br />
				  ii)      Overgrazing  by domestic animals that convert the area into deserts.<br />
				  iii)     Hunting/poaching on a large scale for meat, fur, ivory etc-commercial  exploitation.<br />
				  iv)     Export  of some species.<br />
				  v)      An  unbalanced sex ratio<br />
				  vi)     Some  species are narrowly restricted to an area.<br />
				  Vii)  Natural processes are also cause a decline in  the population. Low population may external and new population colonizes, when  death exceeds birth rate.<br />
				  Data  regarding all endangered plant and animal species are recorded in red data  book. According to RDB of IUCNNR (International Union for Conservation of  Nature and Natural Resources) more than 1000 creatures are threatened with  extinction. Among these, most immediate danger are all species of rhinoceros,  Siberian tigers, Mexican gizzly bear, Red wolf, Mountain gorilla, Asiatic lion.  In plants, more than 450 plant species are identified as endangered and  threatened.<br />
  <strong>Wildlife Management and Conservation:</strong><br />
				  The conservation is the practice  of preservation, maintenance, sustainable utilization, restoration and  enhancement of the natural environment. Conservation is judicious management of  resources towards their optimum utilization. Wild life management includes  maintenance of habits suitable to the different species. Both governmental and  non-governmental and voluntary organizations at state and central levels have  been set up to protect wildlife. Ministry of Environment and Forest has been  entrusted with the task of environmental protection.<br />
  <strong>Wildlife Management:</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Protection of natural habitats through  controlled, limited exploitation of species.</li>
				  <li>Maintenance of the viable number of  species in protected areas (National Park, Sanctuary, Biosphere reserve etc.)</li>

				  10.  Projects to conserve endangered species</p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Project Tiger</strong>      <br />
				  The main objective of Project Tiger is to ensure a viable  population of tiger in India for scientific , economic , aesthetic , cultural  and ecological values and to preserve for all time, areas of biological  importance as a natural heritage for the benefit, education and enjoyment of  the people.  Initially, the Project  started with 9 tiger reserves, covering an area of 16,339 sq.km., with a  population of 268 tigers. At present there are 27 tiger reserves covering an  area of 37761 sq.km., with a population of 1498 tigers. This amounts to almost  1.14% of the total geographical area of the country. The selection of reserves  was guided by representation of ecotypical wilderness areas across the  biogeographic range of tiger distribution in the country. Project Tiger is  undisputedly a custodian of major gene pool. It is also a repository of some of  the most valuable ecosystem and habitats for wildlife.<br />
				  Tiger  Reserves are constituted on a 'core-buffer' strategy. The core area is kept  free of biotic disturbances and forestry operations, where collection of minor  forest produce, grazing, human disturbances are not allowed within. However,  the buffer zone is managed as a ‘multiple use area’ with twin objectives of  providing habitat supplement to the spillover population of wild animals from  the core conservation unit, and to provide site specific ecodevelopmental  inputs to surrounding villages for relieving their impact on the core. Project  Tiger has put the tiger on an assured course of recovery from the brink of  extinction, and has resurrected the floral and faunal genetic diversity in some  of our unique and endangered wilderness ecosystem. The population of tigers in  the country has increased significantly to about 4000 from less than 2000 at  the time of launch of the project<br />
				  The  effective protection and concerted conservation measures inside the reserves  have brought about considerable intangible achievements also, viz. arresting  erosion, enrichment of water regime thereby improving the water table and  overall habitat resurrection. Labour intensive activities in tiger reserves  have helped in poverty alleviation amongst the most backward sections, and  their dependence on forests has also reduced. <br />

                    <strong>Asiatic Lion  at Gir</strong><br />
				  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiatic_Lion" title="Asiatic Lion">Asiatic Lions</a> habitat is  dry scrub land and open deciduous forest. These lions were once found across  northern Africa, south west Asia and northern Greece. Now there are only around  411 left in the wild and all of them are in or around the Gir Forest National  Park. The first modern day count of lions was done by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Alexander_Wynter-Blyth" title="Mark Alexander Wynter-Blyth">Mark Alexander  Wynter-Blyth</a>, the Principal of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkumar_College,_Rajkot" title="Rajkumar College, Rajkot">Rajkumar  College, Rajkot</a> sometime between 1948 to 1963, probably  early in his tenure as the Principal during that period. Even though the Gir  Forest is well protected, there are instances of Asiatic Lions being poached.  They have also been poisoned for attacking livestock. Some of the other threats  include floods, fires and the possibility of epidemics and natural calamities.  Gir nonetheless remains the most promising long term preserve for them.</p>
				<p align="justify">The Lion Breeding Programme creates and maintains  breeding centres. It also carries out studies of the behaviour of the Asiatic  lions and also practices <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_insemination" title="Artificial insemination">artificial  insemination</a>. One such centre has been established in the  Sakkarbaug Zoo at the district headquarters of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junagadh" title="Junagadh">Junagadh</a>, which has  successfully bred about 180 lions. 126 pure Asiatic lions have been given to  zoos in India and abroad.<br />
				  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census" title="Census">census</a> of  lions takes place every five years. Previously indirect methods like using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugmark" title="Pugmark">pugmarks</a> of the lion  were adopted for the count. However, during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census" title="Census">census</a> of  April 2005 (which originally was scheduled for 2006, but was advanced following  the reports and controversy over vanishing tigers in India),  &quot;Block-Direct-Total Count&quot; method was employed with the help of  around 1,000 forest officials, experts and volunteers. It means that only those  lions were counted that were &quot;spotted&quot; visually. Use of &quot;live <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait_%28luring_substance%29" title="Bait (luring substance)">bait</a>&quot;  (a prey that is alive and used as a bait) for the exercise, though thought to  be a traditional practice, was not used this time. The reason believed to be  behind this is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_High_Court" title="Gujarat High Court">Gujarat High  Court</a> ruling of 2000 against such a use of animals.<br />
				  Gir National Park and Sanctuary does not have a  designated area for tourists. However, to reduce the tourism hazard to the  wildlife and to promote nature education, an Interpretation Zone has been  created at Devalia within the sanctuary. Within its chained fences, it covers  all habitat types and wildlife of Gir with its feeding-cum-living cages for the  carnivores and a double-gate entry system.<br />
				  The Government of India, with all its political will, is  endeavouring to reinforce tiger conservation programmes in the country. The  Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests, has been convening regular meetings of  the Steering Committee of Project Tiger and the Tiger Crisis Cell to introduce  additional measures for the protection of the tiger and its habitat. The Union  Home Minister has also issued a letter to all the Chief Ministers to take  appropriate steps for conserving wildlife. Further, acknowledging the written  request of the Ministry for according high priority to tiger conservation  programmes in the wake of the renewed tiger crisis, the Prime Minister during  the Indian Board of Wildlife meeting held in March, 1997 has assured full  government support and also proposed to convene a meeting of chief ministers in  the near future to discuss wildlife issues. <br />
				  However, in order to resolve the present tiger crisis the  following issues need special attention:- </p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ol start="1" type="1">
				    <li>Since more than half of the tiger       population of the country is found outside the tiger reserves, there is an       urgent need to introduce a special programme for protection: One of the       measures to counter the threat is to include more new areas into the fold       of Project Tiger. </li>
				    <li>To curb poaching in tiger       reserves, it is necessary to create a &quot;Strike Force&quot; in every       reserve. </li>
				    <li>At least five tiger reserves,       i.e. Palamau and Valmiki in Bihar, Manas (Assam), Indravati (M.P.) and       Nagarjunsagar (Andhra Pradesh) are facing serious problems due to the       insurgents/criminals seeking refuge in them. To bring about normalcy,       deployment of central armed forces is urgently needed. </li>
				    <li>In view of the large scale       illegal trade of tiger parts in big cities, new strategies, based on       identification of bottlenecks, need to be introduced. This would       inevitably involve an in situ conservation mechanism, strengthening of       Central Wildlife Enforcement Agencies and greater financial assistance to       the states. </li>
				    <li>In order to address all these       issues, a substantial increase in the Project Tiger budget would be       essential during the Ninth Plan period. A proposal to this effect has       already been sent by the Ministry to the Planning Commission for       allocating Rs.90 crores under the Project Tiger Scheme for the current       Plan. </li>

                    <strong>Mangrove Forest</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                    <strong>Mangroves</strong> (generally) are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree" title="Tree">trees</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub" title="Shrub">shrubs</a> that grow in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_water" title="Saline water">saline</a> (brackish) coastal habitats in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics" title="Tropics">tropics</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics" title="Subtropics">subtropics</a>. The word is used in at least three senses: (1) refers  to the habitat and entire plant assemblage or <strong>mangal</strong>, for which the  terms <strong>mangrove swamp</strong> and <strong>mangrove forest</strong> are also used, (2) refers   to all trees and large shrubs in the  mangal, and (3) refers to the mangrove <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)"><em>family</em></a> of plants, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizophoraceae" title="Rhizophoraceae">Rhizophoraceae</a>, or even more specifically just to mangrove trees of  the genus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizophora" title="Rhizophora"><em>Rhizophora</em></a>. Mangals are found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentary_depositional_environment" title="Sedimentary depositional environment">depositional</a> coastal environments where fine sediments, often with  high organic content, collect in areas protected from high energy wave action.</p>
				<p align="center"><img src="images/324235" /></p>
				<p align="center">Above  and below water view at the edge of the mangal</p>
				<p align="justify">				  About 110 species have  been identified as belonging to the mangal. Each species has its own  capabilities and solutions to these problems; this may be the primary reason  why, on some shorelines, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizophora" title="Rhizophora">mangrove tree species</a> show distinct zonation. Small environmental  variations within a mangal may lead to greatly differing methods of coping with  the environment. Therefore, the mix of species at any location within the  intertidal zone is partly determined by the tolerances of individual species to  physical conditions, like tidal inundation and salinity, but may also be  influenced by other factors such as predation of plant seedlings by crabs.</p>

				<p align="justify">Once established,  roots of mangrove plants provide a habitat for oysters and help to impede water  flow, thereby enhancing the deposition of sediment in areas where it is already  occurring. Usually, the fine, anoxic sediments under mangroves act as sinks for  a variety of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metals" title="Heavy metals">heavy (trace) metals</a> which are scavenged from the overlying seawater by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloidal_particle" title="Colloidal particle">colloidal particles</a> in the sediments. In areas of the world where  mangroves have been removed for development purposes, the disturbance of these  underlying sediments often creates problems of trace metal contamination of  seawater and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biota_(ecology)" title="Biota (ecology)">biota</a>.</p>
				<p align="center"><img src="images/24235667" /></p>
				<p align="justify">Mangroves protect the  coast from erosion, surge storms (especially during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricanes" title="Hurricanes">hurricanes</a>), and tsunamis. Their massive root system is  efficient at dissipating wave energy. Likewise, they slow down tidal water  enough that its sediment is deposited as the tide comes in and is not  re-suspended when the tide leaves, except for fine particles. As a result,  mangroves build their own environment. Because of the uniqueness of the  mangrove ecosystems and their protection against erosion, they are often the  object of conservation programs including national <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_Action_Plan" title="Biodiversity Action Plan">Biodiversity  Action Plans</a>. <br />
Despite their  benefits, the protective value of mangroves is sometimes overstated. Wave  energy is typically low in areas where mangroves grow, so their effect on  erosion can only be measured in the long-term. Their capacity to limit  high-energy wave erosion is limited to events like storm surges and tsunamis.  Erosion often still occurs on the outer sides of bends in river channels that  wind through mangroves, just as new stands of mangroves are appearing on the  inner sides where sediment is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_(geology)" title="Accretion (geology)">accreting</a>.<br />
Mangroves support unique ecosystems, especially on  their intricate root systems. The mesh of mangrove <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root" title="Root">roots</a> produces a quiet marine region for many young organisms. In areas where roots  are permanently submerged, they may host a wide variety of organisms, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae" title="Algae">algae</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnacle" title="Barnacle">barnacles</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster" title="Oyster">oysters</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_sponge" title="Sea sponge">sponges</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryozoan" title="Bryozoan">bryozoans</a>, which all require a hard substratum for anchoring  while they filter feed. In some cases, export of carbon fixed in mangroves is  important in coastal food webs. The habitats also host several commercially  important species of fish and crustaceans. Despite replanting programs, over  half of the world's mangroves have been lost in recent times. <a name="Biology" id="Biology"></a><a name="Adaptations_to_low_oxygen" id="Adaptations_to_low_oxygen"></a></p>

				  Fossil  fuels such as coal, gas or oil represent the principal source of energy  and supply about eighty five per cent of the  commercial energy requirement. Fossil fuels are types of sedimentary organic  materials, often loosely called bitumens, with asphalt, a solid, and petroleum,  the liquid form. More correctly bitumens are sedimentary organic materials that  are soluble in carbon disulfide.<br />
				  Petroleum  consists largely of paraffins or simple alkanes, with smaller aromatic  compounds such as benzene present in most crude oils. Natural gas is an  abundant fossil fuel that consists largely of methane and ethane, although  traces of higher alkanes are present. Coal, unlike petroleum, contains only a  little hydrogen. Fossil evidence shows that coal is mostly derived from the  burial of terrestrial vegetation with high proportion of lignin and cellulose.<br />
				  Nuclear  power is an attractive alternative to fossil fuels and considered as &quot;the  clear energy alternative&quot;.  Damming  rivers to create hydroelectric power from spinning water turbines has the  attraction of providing a low-cost, renewable, air pollution-free energy  source.<br />
				  There  are several sustainable, environmentally benign energy sources that should be  developed. Among these are wind power, biomass (burning renewable energy crops  such as fast-growing trees or shrubs), small-scale hydropower (low head or  run-of the river turbines), passive-solar space heating, active-solar water  heaters, photovoltaic energy (direct conversion of sunlight to electricity),  and ocean tidal or wave power. A big disadvantage is that most of these  alternative energy sources are diffuse and not always available when or where  we want to use energy.<br />
				  Other  possibilities include converting biomass into methane or methanol fuels or  using electricity to generate hydrogen gas through electrolysis of water. These  fuels would be easily storable, transportable, and used with current technology  without great alterations of existing systems.<br />
  <strong>Conventional exhaustible energy  sources: </strong><br />
				  a)  Fire wood:<br />
				  Man has been logging down the  trees for various purposes including to get firewood as an important one. This  lead to thinning of woodland that had serious consideration from both  ecological and economic viewpoints. The only way out to the problem is making  available to the village the cheaper non-conventional energy sources, such as  biogas and solar energy in usable form.<br />
				  b)  Fossil fuel :<br />
				  Are the most extensively used  sources of energy today. Increase in population and percapital energy demand  coupled with the industrialization at a faster rate are factors responsible for  depletion of fossil fuel. Petroleum and natural gas to-day fulfill 60% of the  world’s total energy requirements. If the exploitation and consumption of these  resources continues at the present incredible rate, there supply may lost only  for a few more decades.<br />
  <strong>Non-conventional  and in-exhaustible energy sources:</strong><br />
				  The rapid depletion of conventional  energy sources has promoted governments and people to concentrate on finding  and tapping some non-conventional energy sources that may last for long. The  in-exhaustible energy sources like solar, hydal, tidal, wind and atomic power,  can only bring hope for the sustained socio-economic development of humanity.<br />
  <strong>a) Solar energy:</strong><br />
				  Research and application in the  field of solar energy have opened new vistas in the direction of fulfilling  world’s future energy requirements. It is especially drawn attention for its  practically free steady supply and pollution free use. This resource can  especially be tapped more effectively in the regions where there are long run  shine hours. Department of non-conventional energy sources of Government of  India has prepared a prespective plan that envisages generation of energy  through non-conventional sources. Chiefly solar, to the extent of 250 million  tons of coal replacement per annum </p>
				<p align="center"><img src="images/1234325" /></p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>b) Wind Power:</strong><br />
                The power of wind is being used  in running mills, irrigation of fields and carrying out other farm activities.  According to DNES, Government of India, 20,000 MW electricity can be generated  from the wind alone.<br />

				<strong>c) Hydro power:</strong><br />
				  It is considered to be the  cheapest source of electricity. The Brahmaputra basin has the highest  hydropower potential and nearly 30% of the country’s production.  Next to it rank the Indus, Godavari and Ganga  basins respectively. Apart from economic consideration development of such  projects is beneficial for irrigation and other purposes.<br />
                  <strong>d)  Atomic power:</strong><br />
				  Atomic  power appears to be the only hope for large-scale energy requirements when  fossil fuels are exhausted. Atomic energy has its application not only in  generation of electricity but has successfully been used in chemical and food  processing industry. The important constraints in atomic energy generation are  cost of construction and maintenance of plants and also disposal of radioactive  wastes.</p>
				<p align="justify"><img src="images/23423556" /></p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>e) Bio-energy:</strong><br />
				  Organic wastes provide an  important renewable source of energy. It is considered to be advantageous in  view of its relatively cheaper supply, and are of organic wastes in its  generation reduces the impending threat of pollution due to their release in  environment. As such, it serves two purposes; fuel production and waste  disposal. It has more practical applicability in villages where organic waste,  in the form of cattle dung, is available in plenty. Biogas so generated is thus  economic and convenient to use as compared to conventional practice of burning  of dry dung cakes.<br />
				  Since the total natural  resources available are limited, the way-out to the problem seems only through  control of population and also the per capita consumption of resources. Because  it is difficult to bring down per capita consumption, the recycling and  stringent conservation can bring hope for sustained development without  reducing per capita  use of resources.<br />
                  <strong>3.4. Food Resources</strong> <br />
				  We have  thousands of edible plants and animals over the world,  out of which only about three dozen types  constitute the major food of humans. The main food resource include wheat,  rice, maize, potato, barely, oats, cassava, sugarcane, pulses, sorghum, millet,  about 20 or 50 common fruits and vegetables, milk, meat, fish and sea food. 76%  of world food is produced from croplands and most it produced grains. About 17%  of world food is obtained from Rangeland (Meat etc). Seven % of world food  supplied by oceanic fisheries. About 30,000  plant species are eatable. 2/3 of the people used traditional grains (rice, wheat  etc.,). People consume more beef, pork, chicken; egg etc., Fish and sea food  are the important sources of food.  Milk  products are also widely used.<br />

				<p align="justify"><strong>Under  Nutrition and Malnutrition </strong><br />
                  <strong>          </strong>To  maintain good health and resistant disease, we need large amount of macronutrients  such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats and smaller amount of micronutrients such  as vitamins A,C and E and minerals such as iron, calcium and iodine.<br />
                <strong>a)  Under nutrition</strong></p>
				<div align="justify">
				  <ul>
				    <li>The Food and Agriculture Organization  (FAO) of United Nations estimated that on an average, minimum calorie intake on  a global scale is 2,500 calories per day.</li>
				    <li>Peoples receiving less than 90% of  these minimum dietary calories are called under nourished.</li>
				    <li>If it is less than 80% that are said  to be seriously undernourished.</li>
