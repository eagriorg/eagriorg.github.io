			    <p align="justify"><strong>Disaster  Management</strong>		        </p>
			    <p align="justify">There are no  standardized rules defining the different phases of the disaster management  cycle. Different agencies use different cycles depending upon their objectives.  However, while approaches vary, it is agreed that disaster management  activities should be carried out in a cycle. The following figures  illustrates the phases of the disaster  management cycle, which are described as follows: <br />
                <strong> </strong></p>
			    <p align="justify"><strong>Disaster  prevention, mitigation and preparedness</strong><br />
				  The first  important steps towards reducing disaster impact are to correctly analyse the  potential risk and identify measures that can prevent, mitigate or prepare for  emergencies. Information and Communication Technology can play a significant  role in highlighting risk areas, vulnerabilities and potentially affected  populations by producing geographically referenced analysis through, for  example, a geographic information system (GIS). The importance of timely  disaster warning in mitigating negative impacts can never be underestimated.  For example, although damage to property cannot be avoided, developed countries  have been able to reduce loss of life due to disasters much more effectively  than their counterparts in the developing world. A key reason for this is the  implementation of effective disaster warning systems and evacuation procedures  used by the developed countries, and the absence of such measures in the  developing world.<br />
                  <strong>Comparison of Damage Caused by Three Recent  Disasters</strong> <br />
                  <strong> </strong><br />
				  All the figures  reported in the above table are rough estimates as it is impossible to have  exact figures in such situations. However, it clearly shows that in the case of  Hurricane, Katrina, although the economic loss and damage to property were much  higher, the number of deaths was remarkably less than that resulting from the  Indian Ocean tsunami in Sri Lanka and the Pakistan earthquake. This is largely  because in Sri Lanka and Pakistan, the victims were mainly communities living  below the poverty line – a factor that significantly contributed to their  vulnerability – and because effective disaster warning systems were not in  place. In New Orleans, official warnings were dispatched in advance and many in  the affected areas were evacuated in time. In addition, the disaster management  process was much better than what it had been in Sri Lanka and Pakistan,  despite the heavy criticism it received.<br />
				  A warning can  be defined as the communication of information about a hazard or threat to a  population at risk, in order for them to take appropriate actions to mitigate  any potentially negative impacts on themselves, those in their care and their  property.<br />
				  The occurrence  of a hazard does not necessarily result in a disaster. While hazards cannot be  avoided, their negative impacts can be mitigated. The goal of early public  warning is to ensure to the greatest extent possible that the hazard does not  become a disaster. Such warnings must be unambiguous, communicate the risks  succinctly and provide necessary guidance.<br />
				  The success of  a warning can be measured by the actions that it causes people to take, such as  evacuation or avoiding at-risk areas. In a disaster situation, there is no  doubt that timely warnings allow people to take actions that saves lives,  reduce damage to property and minimize human suffering. To facilitate an  effective warning system, there is a major need for better coordination among  the early warning providers as well as those handling logistics and raising  awareness about disaster preparedness and management.<br />
				  While disaster  warnings are meant to be a public good, they are often most effectively  delivered through privately-owned communication networks and devices. There are  many new communication technologies that allow warning providers not only to  reach the people at risk but also to personalize their warning message to a  particular situation. Opportunities are available right now to significantly  reduce loss of life and potential economic hardship if disaster warning systems  can be improved.<br />
				  It is important  to note that disaster warning is indeed a system, not a singular technology,  constituting the identification, detection and risk assessment of the hazard,  the accurate identification of the vulnerability of a population at risk, and  finally, the communication of information about the threat to the vulnerable  population in sufficient time and clarity so that they can take action to avert  negative consequences. This final component underscores the importance of  education and creating awareness in the population so that they may respond  with the appropriate actions.<br />
                  </p>
			    <p align="justify"><strong>Disaster Warning</strong> <br />
				  Disaster Reduction identifies several key  parties that play major roles in the disaster management process, especially in  disaster warning. <br />
                  <strong>Communities, </strong>particularly those most  vulnerable, are vital to people-centred early warning systems. Their input into  system design and their ability to respond ultimately determine the extent of  risk associated with natural hazards. Communities should be aware of hazards  and potential negative impacts to which they are exposed and be able to take  specific actions to minimize the threat of loss or damage. As such, the  geographic location of a community is an essential determinant in the selection  of disasters on which the system should focus their community education. For  example, coastal communities need to be educated and prepared for the  possibility of a tsunami, while a mountain community can be educated to respond  to an early warning system for landslides.<br />
                  <strong>Local governments </strong>should have considerable  knowledge of the hazards to which their communities are exposed. They must be  actively involved in the design and maintenance of early warning systems, and  understand information received to be able to advise, instruct or engage the  local population in a manner that increases their safety and reduces the  potential loss of resources on which the community depends.<br />
                  <strong>National governments </strong>are responsible for  policies and frameworks that facilitate early warning, in addition to the  technical systems necessary for the preparation and issuance of timely and  effective hazard warnings for their respective countries. They should ensure  that warnings and related responses are directed towards the most vulnerable  populations through the design of holistic disaster response and early warning  frameworks that address the specific needs of the related micro- and  macro-level actors. The provision of support to local communities and local  governments to develop operational capabilities is an essential function to  translate early warning knowledge into risk reduction practices.<br />
                  <strong>Regional institutions and  organizations </strong>should provide specialized knowledge and advice in support of national  efforts to develop or sustain the operational capabilities of countries that  share a common geographical environment. Regional organizations are crucial to  linking international capabilities to the particular needs of individual  countries and in facilitating effective early warning practices among adjacent  countries.<br />
                  <strong>International bodies </strong>should provide support for  national early warning activities and foster the exchange of data and knowledge  between individual countries. Support may include the provision of advisory  information, technical assistance, and policy and organizational support  necessary to ensure the development and operational capabilities of national  authorities or agencies responsible for early warning practice.<br />
                  <strong>Non-governmental  organizations (NGOs) </strong>play a critical role in raising awareness among individuals and  organizations involved in early warning and in the implementation of early  warning systems, particularly at the community level. In addition, they play an  important advocacy role to help ensure that early warning stays on the agenda  of government policy makers.<br />
                  <strong>The private sector </strong>has a diverse role to play  in early warning, including developing early warning capabilities in their own  organizations. The private sector is also essential as they are usually better  equipped to implement Information and Communication Technology-based solutions.  The private sector has a large untapped potential to help provide skilled  services in the form of technical manpower, know-how, or donations of goods or  services (in-kind and cash), especially for the communication, dissemination  and response elements of early warning.<br />
                  <strong>The media </strong>plays an important role in  improving the disaster consciousness of the general population and in  disseminating early warnings. The media can be the critical link between the  agency providing the warning and the general public.<br />
                  <strong>The scientific community </strong>has a critical role in  providing specialized scientific and technical input to assist governments and  communities in developing early warning systems. Their expertise is critical to  analysing the risks communities face from natural hazards, supporting the  design of scientific and systematic monitoring and warning services, fostering  data exchange, translating scientific or technical information into  comprehensible messages, and disseminating understandable warnings to those at  risk.</p>
			    <p align="justify"><strong>Channels Used for Disaster  Warning</strong> <br />
                  <strong>Radio  and Television</strong><br />
			      Considered the  most traditional electronic media used for disaster warning, radio and  television have a valid use. The effectiveness of these two media is high  because even in developing countries and rural environments where the  tele-density is relatively low, they can be used to spread a warning quickly to  a broad population. The only possible drawback of these two media is that their  effectiveness is significantly reduced at night, when they are normally switched  off. <br />
			      After the  Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004, many radio manufacturers considered introducing  new digital radio alert systems that react even if the set is switched off. In  order to trigger this alarm, a special flag integrated into the received signal  from a terrestrial transmitter or a satellite would be used and the set would  automatically tune to the emergency broadcast channel. The only disadvantage of  this system is that to introduce a new generation of receivers in analogue  environment generally takes 5 to 10 years. With digital receivers, this would  be somewhat easier (Dunnette, 2006). <br />
                  <strong>Telephone  (Fixed and Mobile)</strong><br />
			      Telephones can  play an important role in warning communities about the impending danger of a  disaster.<br />
                  <strong>Short  Message Service</strong><br />
			      Short message  service (SMS) is a service available on most digital mobile phones that permits  the sending of short messages (also known as ‘text messages’, ‘SMSes’, ‘texts’  or ‘txts’) between mobile phones, other handheld devices and even landline  telephones. <br />
                  <strong>Satellite  Radio</strong><br />
			      A satellite  radio or subscription radio is a digital radio that receives signals broadcast  by communications satellite, which covers a much wider geographical range than  terrestrial radio signals. Satellite radio functions anywhere there is line of  sight between the antenna and the satellite, given there are no major  obstructions such as tunnels or buildings. Satellite radio audiences can follow  a single channel regardless of location within a given range.Satellite radio  can play a key role during both disaster warning and disaster recovery phases.  Its key advantage is the ability to work even outside of areas not covered by  normal radio channels. Satellite radios can also be of help when the  transmission towers of the normal radio station are damaged in a disaster.<br />
                  <strong>Internet/Email</strong><br />
			      The role  Internet, email and instant messages can play in disaster warning entirely  depends on their penetration within a community and usage by professionals such  as first responders, coordinating bodies, etc. While these media can play a  prominent role in a developed country, where nearly half of all homes and  almost all offices have Internet connections, this is not the case in the  developing world. In many developing countries, less than 5 percent of the  population uses the Internet and even those who are users do not use it on a  regular basis. In such a situation, it is difficult to expect Internet and  email to play any critical role.</p>
			    <p align="justify"><strong>GIS and Remote Sensing in  Disaster Management</strong><br />
				  GIS can be  loosely defined as a system of hardware and software used for storage,  retrieval, mapping and analysis of geographic data. Spatial features are stored  in a coordinate system (latitude, longitude, state, plane, etc.) that  references a particular place on the earth. Descriptive attributes in tabular  form are associated with spatial features. Spatial data and associated  attributes in the same coordinate system can then be layered together for  mapping and analysis. GIS can be used for scientific investigations, resource  management and development planning.<br />
				  Remote sensing  is the measurement or acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon  by a recording device that is not in physical or intimate contact with the  object. In practice, remote sensing is the remote utilization (as from  aircraft, spacecraft, satellite or ship) of any device for gathering  information about the environment. Thus, an aircraft taking photographs, earth  observation and weather satellites, monitoring of a foetus in the womb via  ultrasound, and space probes are all examples of remote sensing. In modern  usage, the term generally refers to techniques involving the use of instruments  aboard aircraft and spacecraft.<br />
				  As disaster  management work usually involves a large number of different agencies working  in different areas, the need for detailed geographical information in order to  make critical decisions is high. By utilizing a GIS, agencies involved in the  response can share information through databases on computer-generated maps in  one location. Without this capability, disaster management workers have to  access a number of department managers, their unique maps and their unique  data. Most disasters do not allow time to gather these resources. GIS thus  provides a mechanism to centralize and visually display critical information  during an emergency.<br />
				  There is an  obvious advantage to using a map with remote sensing or GIS inputs instead of a  static geographical map. A static map is mostly analogous and is not  interactive. On the other hand, a vulnerability map with GIS input provides  dynamic information with cause and effect relationship. As shown in Figure ,  the visualization effect is much more effective in the latter case.<br />
  <strong> </strong><br />
  <strong>Difference Between an Ordinary (2D) Map and a Map with GIS Input</strong> </p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>The use of GIS in different phases</strong><br />
                    <strong>Planning</strong><br />
				  Locating and  identifying potential problems is a core requirement in disaster management.  GIS can be used effectively to achieve this objective. Using a GIS, it is  possible to pinpoint hazard trends and start to evaluate the consequences of  potential emergencies or disasters. When hazards are viewed with other map  data, such as buildings, residential areas, rivers and waterways, streets,  pipelines, power lines, storage facilities, forests, etc., disaster management  officials can formulate mitigation, preparedness, response and possible  recovery needs.<br />
  <strong>Mitigation</strong><br />
				  After potential  emergency situations are identified, mitigation needs can be addressed. This  process involves analysing the developments in the immediate aftermath of a disaster,  evaluating the damage and determining what facilities are required to be  reinforced for construction or relocation purposes. Mitigation may also include  implementing legislation that prevents building structures in areas prone to  earthquake, flood or tsunami. Other mitigation approaches may target fire-safe  roofing materials in wildfire hazard areas. Utilizing existing databases linked  to geographic features in GIS makes the task of monitoring these possible.<br />
  <strong>Preparedness</strong><br />
				  During the  preparedness and response phases, GIS can accurately support better response  planning in areas such as determining evacuation routes or locating vulnerable  infrastructure and vital lifelines, etc. It also supports logistical planning  to be able to provide relief supplies by displaying previously available  information on roads, bridges, airports, railway and port conditions and  limitations. Apart from this, activities such as evacuee camp planning can also  be done using GIS.<br />
  <strong>Disaster response</strong><br />
				  The most  difficult period of a disaster is the immediate aftermath. This period calls  for prompt action within an exceptionally short period of time. In the  aftermath of any disaster, a significant number of individuals will be injured  and/or displaced. Many of them may still be living with the trauma they have  encountered, including loss of loved ones. Affected individuals may also be  without food or other essential items. They might be waiting in temporary  shelters, with no idea what to do next. Some might need immediate medical attention,  while the disaster aftermath environment also creates ideal breeding grounds  for possible epidemics.</p>

			        </ul>
		        </div>
			    <p align="justify"><strong>Disaster recovery</strong><br />
				  Disaster  reconstruction has to start as soon as the initial disaster cleanup has taken  place. This is a very complex endeavour, requiring a huge array of skill sets  and a thorough knowledge of an ever-increasing variety of techniques and  equipment. A range of software tools are being used for these purposes. Thus,  while the role of Information and Communication Technology  in the long-term disaster recovery process is  not as apparent as it is in disaster warning, there is no doubt that Information  and Communication Technology is being used widely to expedite these activities.<br />
  <strong>Specific Disaster  Management Software</strong><br />
				  Different types  of software tools are being used to gather, store and analyse data related to  disasters, not only in post-disaster conditions, but also as a long-term  measure to mitigate the risk of the disasters. One such approach is known as  DesInventar.<br />
				  DesInventar is  a methodical way to gather and store information about characteristics and  effects of different types of disasters, particularly the ones not visible from  global or national scales. This allows for the observation and analysis of  accumulated data regarding these ‘invisible’ disasters at a global or national  scale.<br />
				  Despite the  fact that disaster preparedness has not been identified as one of the  Millennium Development Goals, it is apparent that proper mechanisms for  disaster awareness and means of disaster recovery are essential to achieving  the Millennium Development Goals. In particular, the Millennium Development  Goal targets such as integrating the principles of sustainable development into  country policies and programmes, and reversing the loss of environmental  resources can never be achieved without giving due emphasis to effective  disaster management strategies.<br />
  <strong>Disaster management in India</strong><br />
				  The <strong>National  Disaster Management Authority</strong> (NDMA), headed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India" title="Prime Minister of India">Prime Minister of India</a>, is the Apex Body for Disaster  Management in India. The setting up of the NDMA and the creation of an enabling  environment for institutional mechanisms at the State and District levels is  mandated by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Disaster_Management_Act,_2005&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Disaster Management Act, 2005 (page does not exist)">Disaster Management Act, 2005</a>.</p>
				<h2 align="justify">Evolution of NDMA </h2>
				<p align="justify">Emergence of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization" title="Organization">organization</a> is always an evolutionary process. Establishment of NDMA  has also gone through the same processes. Towards this aim, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India" title="Government of India">Government of                 India</a> (GOI), in recognition of the importance of Disaster Management as a  national priority, has set up a High-Powered Committee (HPC) in August 1999 and  also a nation committee after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Gujarat_earthquake" title="2001 Gujarat earthquake">2001 Gujarat earthquake</a>, for making recommendations on the  preparation of Disaster Management plans and suggestion effective mitigation  mechanisms. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Five-Year_Plan_%28India%29" title="Tenth Five-Year Plan (India)">Tenth Five-Year Plan</a> Document also had, for the first  time, a detailed chapter on Disaster Management. Similarly, the Twelfth <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Commission_of_India" title="Finance Commission of India">Finance Commission of India</a> was also mandated to review the  financial arrangements for Disaster Management. On 23 December 2005, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India" title="Government of India">Government of India</a> enacted the Disaster Management Act,  which envisaged the creation of the National Disaster Management Authority  (NDMA), headed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India" title="Prime Minister of India">Prime Minister of India</a>, and State Disaster Management Authorities  (SDMAs) headed by respective Chief Ministers of the States, to spearhead and  implement a holistic and integrated approach to Disaster Management in India.</p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Floods</strong><br />
				  A flood is an  expance of water submerging land. A flood is  caused by excess water in a location, usually due to rain from a storm or  thunderstorm or the rapid melting of snow. A flood happens when an area of  land, usually low-lying, is covered with water. The worst floods usually occur  when a river overflows its banks. The flood is constituted not only of the  overflowing water but also of all other waters that are unable to drainoff into  water channels.<br />

			    <p align="justify"><strong>Cyclone</strong><br />
				  The name cyclone was  first coined by Captain Henry Piddington, Chairman of Marine Court, Calcutta in  1848. It is derived from Greek word means coil of a snake. Cyclone is an  meteorological phenomena in which an area of low pressure characterized by  inward spiraling winds that rotate counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere  and clockwise in the southern hemisphere of the earth. Near the places of their  origin they are only 80 Km in diameter, but well developed cyclones have their  diameter ranging from 300 to 1500 km. They move at faster rate over the oceans  than over the land because the irregularities of the land surface retard their  speed. The six main types of cyclones are polar cyclone, polar low, extra tropical,  subtropical, tropical and mesoscale.</p>
				<p align="justify"><strong> Polar cyclone</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Polar or arctic cyclones are vast areas of low pressure.  A polar cyclone is a low pressure weather system usually spanning 1,000-2000  kilometers per hour, in which the air circulates in a counterclockwise fashion  in the northern hemisphere. <strong></strong><br />
                    <strong>Polar low</strong> <br />
				  A polar  low is a small-scale, short-lived atmosphere system (depression) that is found  over the ocean areas in both the Northern and southern hemispheres.   They are part of the larger class of meso scale  weather systems. Polar lows can be difficult to detect using conventional  weather reports and are a hazard to high latitude operations, such as shipping  and gas and oil platforms. Polar lows have been referred to by many other  terms, such as comma cloud, mesocyclone, polar meso scale vortex, Arctic  hurricane, Arctic low and depression.</p>
				<p align="justify"> <strong>Extra-tropical</strong><br />
				  An extra  tropical cyclone sometimes inaccurately called a cyclone is a synoptic scale  low pressure weather system that has neither tropical nor polar  characteristics. The “extra-tropical” refers to the fact that this type of  cyclone generally occurs outside of the tropics, in the middle latitudes of the  planet. These systems may also be described as “mid-latitude cyclones” or “post-tropical  cyclones.<br />
  <strong>Sub-tropical</strong><br />
				  A  sub-tropical cyclone is a weather system that has some characteristics of an  extra-tropical cyclone.  It can in a wide  band of latitude, from the equator to 50°C. ZIYAD is a very  dangerous cyclone now affecting Mauritius.<br />
				  <strong>Tropical       </strong><br />
  <strong>             </strong>A tropical cyclone is a  low-pressure cyclonic storm system. It is caused by evaporated   water which comes off the ocean and becomes  a storm.  Typical  cyclones are the worst natural hazards in the tropics. They are large revolving  vortices in the atmosphere extending horizontally from 150-1000 km and  vertically from the surface from 12-14 km.  Strong winds spiraling anti-clockwise in the  Northern Hemisphere blow around the cyclone center at the low level. At the  higher levels, the sense of rotation is just opposite to that  at the lower level. They generally move  300-5000 km per day over the ocean. While moving over the ocean, they pick up  energy from the warm water of the ocean and some of them grow into a  devastating intensity. On an average, about 5-6 tropical cyclones form in the  Bay of Bengal and the Arabian sea every year,  out of which 2-3 may be severe. <br />
				  Depending  on their location and strength, there are various terms by which tropical  cyclones are known, such as hurricane, typhoon, tropical storm, cyclonic storm  and tropical depression. They are all cyclonic storm systems that form over the  oceans. Tropical cyclones can produce extremely strong winds, tornadoes,  torrential rain, high waves, and storm surges. The heavy rains and storm surges  can produce extensive flooding. Although one cannot control  cyclones, the effects of cyclones can be mitigated through effective mitigation  policies and strategies. </p>

				        <li>Developing communication infrastructure Amateur Radio has  today emerged as second line unconventional communications systems and is an  important tool for disaster mitigation.</li>
				        <li>Developing shelter belts: Shelter belts with plantations of  trees can act as effective wind-and tide-breakers. Apart from acting as  effective windbreakers and protecting soil crops from being damaged, they also  prevent soil erosion.</li>
				        <li>Developing community cyclone shelters: Cyclone shelters at  strategic locations can help in minimizing the loss of human life. In the  normal course of life, these shelters can be used as public utility buildings.</li>
				        <li>Construction of permanent houses: There is a need to build  appropriately-designed concrete houses that can withstand high winds and tidal  waves.</li>
				        <li>Training and education: Public awareness programs that  inform the population about their response to cyclone warnings and preparedness  can go a long way in reducing causalities.</li>
				        <li>Land  use control and settlement planning: Ideally, no residential and industrial  units should be permitted in the coastal belt of 5 km from the sea, as it is  the most vulnerable belt. No further growth of settlements in this region  should be permitted. Major settlements and other important establishments  should be located beyond 10 km from the sea.</li>

				<p align="justify"><strong>Earthquakes and Mitigation Measures</strong><br />
				  Earthquake is those movements of the earth  crust which make the ground vibrate and shake backward and forward. The shaking  of earth crust proceeds in the form of waves from the centre of disturbance.  Longitudinal waves, transverse waves and surface waves are the 3 types of  waves. Earthquake may be caused by two types of forces.<br />
				  1) Techtonic occurrence: techtonic occurrence like faulting,  breaking of rocks, raising or sinking of layers of the earth, folding of the  strata or vapour seeking to escape from the earth.</p>
				<p align="justify">2) volcanic activity: violent eruptions and intrusion of igneous  magma from below the earth.</p>

				  It has been several years  since the earthquakes struck Gujarat on January 26, 2001, rehabitation has been  done on a massive scale. Gujarat’s experience has taught that building shelters  with less vulnerability to earthquakes should also take into consideration of the  specific needs of the victims instead of being a top-down approach. The role of  NGO’s in this is very important. Their strength lies in their manpower,  informality in operations and valuable human resources. Their ability to reach  out to the community and sensitivity to local traditions is an asset in such  situations. <br />
				  The  initiatives of the International Fund for  Agricultural Development  in supporting  the self-employed Woman association(SEWA) and the Government’s initiative in  community-based livelihood security for earthquakes and drought victims have  the potential to shape future disaster response and development projects in  Gujarat, the Gujarat Woman’s Economic Development Corporation (GWEDC)  initiative in reviving woman’s businesses after the calamity also provides many  practical lessons in regenerating local economies and artisan markets.                    <br />
			    The coordination between  Government, local NGO’s and local community initiatives, both for rescue as  well as rehabilitation, needs to be strengthened as this can cause delays,  overlaps and waste of relief material and efforts.</p>
			    <p align="justify"><strong>Land Slides and Mitigation Measures</strong><br />
			      In the recent years, intensive  construction activity and the destabilizing forces of nature have aggravated  the land Slide problem.<strong> </strong>Landslides  refer to the downward sliding of huge quantities of land masses. Sliding occurs  along steep slopes of hills of mountains. The rate of movement of such a mass  is never constant. Landslides occur as a result of  changes on a slope, sudden or gradual, either in its composition, structure,  hydrology or vegetation. The changes can be due to geology, climate, weathering,  changing land use and earthquakes.<br />
			      The  causes of landslides  may be grouped into two types:</p>
	        
			      <div align="justify">
				      <ul>
				        <li>Inherent or internal causes.</li>
				        <li>Immediate causes.</li>
			        </ul>
		        </div>
			    <p align="justify"><strong>Effect of landslides: </strong></p>
				<p align="justify">Landslides are not only destructive to  the man but also to the structures. One of the most disastrous landslides  occurred in Switzerland in 1806, when great masses of loose rock and soil  suddenly slide down into the valley form the mountainside. It resulted in  killing of 800 persons. Initially the Vajont Dam, was the highest arch failed  due to landslide on October 9, 1963, when a rock mass of about 600 million tons  slide down into the lake.</p>
				
				
			      <div align="justify">
				      <ul>
				        <li>A significant  reduction in  hazards caused by  landslides can be achieved by prevention of the exposure of population and  facilitates by physically controlling the landslides. </li>
				        <li>Development  programs that involve modification of the topography, exploitation of natural  resources and change in the balance load on the ground should not be permitted. </li>
				        <li>Some critical  measures that could be undertaken to prevent further  landslides are drainage measures, erosion  control measures such bamboo check-dams, terracing, jute and coir netting and  rock control measures such as grass plantation, vegetated dry masonry  walls, retaining walls and, most importantly,  preventing deforestation and improving afforestation.</li>
				        <li>Disasters  cannot be totally prevented. However, early warning systems, careful planning  and preparedness on part of the vulnerable community would help in minimizing  the loss of life and property due to these disasters.</li>
