				<p>The industrial sector is relatively more organized and less dependent  on natural factors than agricultural sector. Hence, the commercial banks tended  to concentrate more on industrial sector than agricultural sector. The Indian  Central Banking Committee (1931), the Agricultural Finance Sub-committee  (1945), the Rural Banking Enquiry Committee (1950), the All India Rural Credit  survey committee (1951), the All India Rural Debt and Investment Survey  (1961-62) and the Informal Group on Institutional Arrangements for Agricultural  Credit (1964) - all these expert committees were of the opinion that  co-operatives and not the commercial banks were the suitab­le credit agencies  for agriculture.<br />
            Financing agriculture  by commercial banks was not significant until 1950. However, the Rural Banking  Enquiry Committee (1950) recommended that banking facilities should be extended  to rural areas. The commercial banks were reluctant to enter the field of  agricultural finance as they felt that it would be risky and costly. The  Imperial Bank of India was established in 1921 by the amalgamati­on of the  Presidency Banks (Bank of Bengal, Bank of Bombay and Bank of Madras). Until the  establishment of the Reserve Bank of India in 1935, the Imperial Bank of India  was the sole banker to the government. As there was no branch for RBI, the  Imperial Bank of India acted as an agent of the RBI for the purpose of  transacting businesses of government.<br />
            In 1955, the state  Bank of India Act was passed and Imperial Bank India was named as the State  Bank of India. In 1959, State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act was passed  and seven Associate Banks or Subsidiary Banks of SBI were started functioning.  They are:<br />
State Bank of  Mysore<br />
State Bank of Travancore<br />
State Bank of  Sowrashtra <br />
State Bank of Hydrabad.<br />
State Bank of Bikanir and Jaipur. <br />
State Bank of Patiala. <br />
State Bank of Indore.<br />
            The role of commercial  banks in rural credit was negligible until the sixties as is evident from the  All India Debt and Investment survey Report, 1961-62 and 1971-72. They had  shown little interest in direct financing of agriculture and had  confined their financing activities to the movement of agricultural produces  only.</p>
				<p>To serve better the credit needs of rural society, fourteen commercial  banks with deposits worth Rs.50 crores or more were nationalized on July 19,  1969. In her broadcast address of July 19, 1969 on bank nationalization, Prime  Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi stated that nationalization was meant for an early  realization of the objectives of social control which were spelt out as: <br />
				  i) removal of control of money  market by a few,<br />
				  ii) provision of adequate  credit for agriculture, small industry and export,<br />
				  iii) encouragement of a new  class of entrepreneurs and<br />
				  iv) strengthening the professional  banking management system. <br />
				  The nationalized banks were:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Central Bank of India</li>
				  <li>Bank of India. </li>
				  <li>Punjab National Bank</li>
				  <li>Bank of Baroda.</li>
				  <li>United Commercial bank. </li>
				  <li>Canara Bank.</li>
				  <li>United Bank of India</li>
				  <li>Dena Bank</li>
				  <li>Syndicate Bank.</li>
				  <li>Union Bank of India</li>
				  <li>Allahabad Bank</li>
				  <li>Indian Bank</li>
				  <li>Bank of Maharashtra</li>
				  <li>Indian Overseas Bank</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>This was followed  by nationalization of six more commercial banks in April 1980. They were:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>New  Bank of India. </li>
				  <li>Vijaya  Bank. </li>
				  <li>Corporation  Bank. </li>
				  <li>Andhra  Bank.</li>
				  <li>Punjab  and Sind Bank.</li>
				  <li>Oriental  Bank of Commerce.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>This  institutional change was effected to pursue the goals of growth and social  justice. <br />
                    <strong>Functions of Commercial Bank</strong></p>
				<p>The  objectives of the changes in the banking structure and the main policies since  the nationalization of commercial banks were:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>wider  territorial and regional spread of branch net work;</li>
				  <li>faster  mobilization of savings through bank deposits; and</li>
				  <li>deployment  of bank credit in favour of neglected sectors the economy.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>In  order to achieve these objectives, the commercial banks involved in the  following activities:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Commercial  banks provide both direct and indirect finance to farmers. Banks provide direct  finance to farmers for the purchase pump-sets, tractors and other agricultural  machineries, for sinking and deepening wells, for land development, for raising  crops, and for setting up of dairy, sheep / goat, poultry, fishery, piggery,  sericulture units. Commercial banks also provide indirect finance, which  includes loan for distribution of fertilizers and other inputs, loan to  electricity boards, loan to Primary Agricultural Credit Societies and  subscribing to debentures of Land Development Banks.</li>
				  <li>They  extend financial assistance to small / marginal farmers identified by District  Rural Development Agency (DRDA)</li>
				  <li>They  established specialized branches exclusively for rural lending</li>
				  <li>They  finance Primary Agricultural Credit Societies ceded to them and organize  Farmers’ Service Societies since 1973-74</li>
				  <li>They  have set-up Regional Rural Banks, F.S.S and LAMPS in selected areas to cater to  the credit needs of the weaker sections.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Policies  and Performance of Commercial Banks</strong><br />
                    <strong>i)  Branch Expansion</strong><br />
				  The branch expansion policy for  1982-83 aimed at achieving a coverage of one bank office, on an average, for a  population of 17000 in the rural and semi-urban areas (as per 1981 census) in  each block and also to eliminate spatial gaps in the availability of banking  facilities so that a rural branch was available within a distance of 10 km and  would serve an area of about 200 square kilometres. The popu­lation norm has  been relaxed from March 31, 1990 to 10,000 with regard to tribal / hilly areas  and sparsely populated regions.<br />
				  Southern Region followed by Central  Region had more number of commercial bank branches during 2008-09 accounting  for 28.1 and 19.9 per cent respectively. However, in terms of coverage of  population per branch Southern and Northern regions have topped the list with  11 thousand, the all India average being 15 thousand. North Eastern Region had  lesser number branches when compared to all other regions.</p>
				<p>The  number of rural branches rapidly increased from 22 percent of the total number  of branch offices in 1969 to 57 percent in  1989 and 40 per cent in 2008-09.<strong> </strong>The  Population per branch office came down from 65,000 in<strong> </strong>1969 to 12,000 in  1989 and 15,000 in 2009. The share of rural branches in case of RRBs and  scheduled banks was 77 and 40 per cent respectively.<br />

				<p><strong>ii) Sectoral allocation</strong><br />
                    <strong>Lending  to Priority Sector</strong><br />
				  At a meeting of the National Credit  Council held in July 1968, it was emphasized that commercial banks should  increase their involvement in the financing of priority sectors, viz.,  agriculture and small-scale industries. The description of the priority sectors  was later formalized in 1972 on the basis of the report submitted by the  Informal Study Group on Statistics relating to advances to the Priority Sectors  constituted by the Reserve Bank in May 1971. On the basis of this report, the  Reserve Bank prescribed a modified return for reporting priority sector  advances and certain guidelines were issued in this connection indicating the  scope of the items to be included under the various categories of priority  sector. Although initially there was no specific target fixed in respect of  priority sector lending, in November 1974 the banks were advised to raise the  share of these sectors in their aggregate advances to the level of 33 1/3 per  cent by March 1979.<br />
				  At a meeting of the Union Finance  Minister with the Chief Executive Officers of public sector banks held in March  1980, it was agreed that banks should aim at raising the proportion of their  advances to priority sectors to 40 per cent by March 1985. Subsequently, on the  basis of the recommendations of the Working Group on the Modalities of  Implementation of Priority Sector Lending and the Twenty Point Economic  Programme by Banks, all commercial banks were advised to achieve the target of  priority sector lending at 40 per cent of aggregate bank advances by 1985.  Sub-targets were also specified for lending to agriculture and the weaker  sections within the priority sector. Since then, there have been several  changes in the scope of priority sector lending and the targets and sub-targets  applicable to various bank groups. <br />
				  On  the basis of the recommendations made in September 2005 by the Internal Working  Group set up in Reserve Bank to examine, review and recommend changes, if any,  in the existing policy on priority sector lending including the segments  constituting the priority sector, targets and sub-targets, etc. and the  comments / suggestions received thereon from banks, financial institutions,  public and the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA), it has been decided to include  only those sectors as part of the priority sector, which impact large segments  of population and the weaker sections, and which are employment-intensive.  Accordingly the broad categories of priority sector for all scheduled  commercial banks will be as under: <br />
  <strong>Categories  of Priority Sector</strong><br />
  <strong>(i)  Agriculture (Direct and Indirect finance): </strong>Direct  finance to agriculture shall include short, medium and long term loans given  for agriculture and allied activities directly to individual farmers, Self-Help  Groups (SHGs) or Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) of individual farmers without  limit and to others (such as corporates, partnership firms and institutions) up  to Rs. 20 lakh, for taking up agriculture / allied activities.<strong> </strong>Indirect  finance to agriculture shall include loans given for agriculture and allied  activities as specified in Section I, appended.<br />
  <strong>(ii)  Small Enterprises (Direct and Indirect Finance): </strong>Direct  finance to small enterprises shall include all loans given to small  (manufacturing) enterprises engaged in manufacture/ production, processing or  preservation of goods, and small (service) enterprises engaged in providing or  rendering of services, and whose investment in plant and machinery and  equipment (original cost excluding land and building and such items as  mentioned therein) respectively, does not exceed the amounts specified in  Section I, appended.<strong> </strong><br />
				  Indirect  finance to small enterprises shall include finance to any person providing  inputs to or marketing the output of artisans, village and cottage industries,  handlooms and to cooperatives of producers in this sector. <br />
  <strong>(iii)  Other Small Business / Service Enterprises: </strong>Other  Small Business / Service Enterprises shall include small business, retail  trade, professional &amp; self-employed persons, small road &amp; water  transport operators and all other service enterprises, as per the definition  given in Section I appended.<strong> </strong><br />
  <strong>(iv)  Micro Credit: </strong>Provision of credit and other financial  services and products of very small amounts not exceeding Rs. 50,000 per  borrower to the poor, either directly or indirectly through a SHG / JLG mechanism  or any intermediary (including NBFC / NGO / MFI), or to an NBFC / NGO engaged  in provision of credit to the poor up to Rs. 50,000 per borrower will  constitute micro credit. The poor for this purpose shall include persons below  the poverty line in the respective areas. <br />
  <strong>(v)  Education loans: </strong>Education loans include  loans and advances granted to only individuals for educational purposes up to  Rs. 10 lakh for studies in India and      Rs. 20 lakh for studies abroad, and do not include those granted to  institutions; <br />
  <strong>(vi)  Housing loans: </strong>Loans up to Rs. 15 lakh per family, for  construction of houses by individuals, (excluding loans granted by banks to  their own employees) and loans given for repairs to the damaged houses of  individuals up to Rs. 1 lakh in rural and semi-urban areas and up to Rs. 2 lakh  in urban areas.<strong> </strong><br />
				  (2)  Investments by banks in securitized assets, representing loans to agriculture  (direct or indirect), small enterprises (direct or indirect) and housing, shall  be eligible for classification under respective categories of priority sector  (direct or indirect) depending on the underlying assets, provided the  securitized assets are originated by banks and financial institutions and  fulfill the Reserve Bank of India guidelines on securitization. This would mean  that the banks' investments in the above categories of securitized assets shall  be eligible for classification under the respective categories of priority  sector only if the securitized advances were eligible to be classified as  priority sector advances before their securitization.<br />
				  (3)  Outright purchases of any loan asset eligible to be categorized under priority  sector, shall be eligible for classification under the respective categories of  priority sector (direct or indirect).<br />
				  (4)  The targets and sub-targets under priority sector lending would be linked to  Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) (Net Bank Credit plus<strong></strong>investments  made by banks in non-SLR bonds held in HTM category) or Credit Equivalent  amount of Off-Balance Sheet Exposures (as defined by Department of Banking  Operations and Development of Reserve Bank of India from time to time),  whichever is higher, as on March 31 of the previous year. Investments made by  banks in the Recapitalization Bonds floated by Government of India will not be  taken into account for the purpose.<br />
				  (5)  In order to encourage banks to increasingly lend directly to the priority  sector borrowers, the banks' deposits placed with NABARD / SIDBI on account of  non-achievement of priority sector lending targets would not be eligible for  classification as indirect finance to agriculture/SSI, as the case may be. </p>

Fifty per cent of the corpus shall  be contributed by foreign banks having shortfall in lending to priority sector  target of 32 per cent of ANBC or credit equivalent amount of Off-Balance Sheet  Exposure, whichever is higher, on a pro-rata basis The balance fifty per cent  of the corpus shall be contributed by foreign banks having aggregate shortfall  in lending to SSI sector and export sector of 10 per cent and 12 per cent  respectively, of ANBC or credit equivalent amount of Off-Balance Sheet  Exposure, whichever is higher, on a pro-rata basis.<br />
                    <strong>2.3 </strong>The  concerned foreign banks will be called upon by SIDBI, as and when required by  them, to contribute to SEDF, after giving one month’s notice.<br />
                    <strong>2.4 </strong>The  interest rates on foreign banks’ contribution to SEDF, period of deposits, etc.  shall be fixed by the Reserve Bank of India from time to time.<br />
                    <strong>3.</strong> Non-achievement of priority sector targets and sub-targets will be taken into  account while granting regulatory clearances/approvals for various purposes.</p>
				<p>As  at present, RRBs will have a target of 60 per cent of their outstanding  advances for priority sector lending. Further, of the total priority sector  advances, at least 25 percent (i.e. 15 percent of the total advances) should be  advanced to weaker sections of the society.<br />
            As per the credit policy of RBI, the  direct finance to agriculture should be to the extent of 18 per cent of the  total credit by the end of March 1990. The percentage of direct finance  extended to agri­culture to the net bank credit was only 1.3 in 1969 and it  rose 16.7 in 1990 and 12.7 per cent in 2008-09. However, the percentage of both  direct and indirect finance to agriculture to the net bank credit put together,  constituted 17.6. The priority sector advances should be at least 40 per cent  of the net bank credit. In 1969, the share of priority sector was only 15 per  cent of the net bank credit and it in­creased to 42 per cent in 1990 and 42.5  per cent in 2008-09. The sub sectors, viz., retail trade, micro – credit, education and housing were  added to priority sector recently and their share to net bank credit was 13.6  per cent which was more than that of direct agricultural  finance during 2008-09.<br />
<strong>Priority Sector  Lending</strong><br />
            The objective of priority sector lending guidelines is to  channelize credit to some of the vulnerable sectors of the economy, which may  not be attractive for the banks from the point of view of profitability but are  important for economic development. Loans granted to agriculture, micro and  small (manufacturing and service) enterprises, micro credit, education and  housing fall under the ambit of priority sector lending by the Indian banks.  Apart from these sectors, the export credit also forms a part of the priority  sector lending in case of foreign banks. In 2007, the guidelines on lending to  priority sector were revised based on the Report of the Internal Working Group  on Priority Sector Lending (Chairman: Shri C. S. Murthy) and feedback received  from the governments, banks, financial institutions, NBFCs, associations of  industries, media, public and Indian Banks’ Association. As per the extant  guidelines, the domestic banks and foreign banks have to extend 40 per cent and  32 per cent, respectively of the adjusted net bank credit1 (ANBC) or the credit  equivalent amount of off-balance sheet exposures, whichever is higher, as on  March 31st of the previous year to the priority sectors.<br />
            In December 2008, the Reserve Bank widened the scope of  priority sector lending by allowing the banks to classify loans granted to  Housing Finance Companies (HFCs), which are approved by National Housing Bank  (NHB) for the purpose of refinance, for on-lending to individuals for  purchase/construction of dwelling units. However, in such cases, the housing  loans granted by HFCs do not exceed Rs.20 lakh per dwelling unit per family.  Further, the eligibility under this measure shall be restricted to five per  cent of the individual bank’s total priority sector lending, on an ongoing  basis. This special dispensation shall apply to loans granted by banks to HFCs  up to March 31, 2010.<br />
            In order to ensure that the sub-target of lending to the  weaker sections is achieved, the domestic SCBs were advised that the shortfall  in lending to weaker sections as on the last reporting Friday of March of each  year, would also be taken into account for the purpose of allocating amounts to  the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) maintained with National Bank  for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) or funds with other Financial  Institutions, as specified by the Reserve Bank, with effect from April 2009.<br />
<strong>Credit to  Agriculture and Allied Activities</strong><br />
            Several measures were taken during the year to increase  the flow of credit to agriculture and allied activities. The Union Budget for  2009-10 set a target of Rs.3,25,000 crore for agricultural credit for the year.  Against this, banks (including co-operative banks and RRBs) disbursed Rs.92,070  crore forming 28.3 per cent of the target during April-July 2009. <br />
            In December 2008, the Reserve Bank modified the facility  of temporary liquidity support for financing agricultural operations. The  limits of the liquidity support availed by scheduled banks under Section 17  (3-B) of RBI Act 1934 and by NABARD under Section 17 (4-E) of RBI Act 1934 was  Rs.7,500 crore and Rs.17,500 crore, respectively with effect from December 6,  2008. This facility was extended up to December 16, 2008.<br />
<strong>Relief Measure for Agriculture – Interest Rate Subvention</strong><br />
            The Union Budget for 2009-10 proposed to continue the  interest subvention scheme to farmers for short term crop loans up to Rs.3 lakh  per farmer at the interest rate of 7 per cent per annum. The budget also  announced an additional subvention of 1 per cent as an incentive to those  farmers who repay their short term crop loans on schedule. Thus, the interest  rate for these farmers will come down to 6 per cent per annum. Net bank credit  plus investments made by banks in non-SLR bonds held in the held-to-maturity  (HTM) category. </p>

                <p><strong>iii) Credit-Deposit Ratio</strong><br />
                  Credit-Deposit Ratio (C-D Ratio) as  per sanction gives an idea as to how much of credit is being sanctioned per  unit of deposit mobilized in a particular state or region. With the objective  of reducing the rural - urban dispari­ties in the deployment of resources  mobilized in the region and for achieving a balanced economic development  especially in the backward rural and semi urban areas, the Government of India  had advised the public sector banks that they should achieve, by the end of  March 1984, a credit-deposit ratio of at least 60 per cent in both rural and  semi-urban areas.</p>

                <p><strong>iv) Specialized Branches for  Agricultural Lending</strong><br />
                  The nationalized banks have set up  specialized branched to deal with rural credit. These branches were established  to over­come the practical difficulties relating to man power, high cost of  operation and follow up of loans given to the farmers. A few examples of  specialized branches are:<br />
                  a)  Agricultural Development Branches (ADB) -State Bank of India.<br />
                  b) Gram Vikas Kendra (GVK) - Bank of Baroda. <br />
                  c) Gramodaya Kendra (GK) - Indian Bank. <br />
                  d)  Rural Service Centres (RSC) - Dena Bank. <br />
                  e)  Farm Clinic Centre - Syndicate Bank. <br />
                  f)  Rural Credit and Development Division - Indian Overseas Bank.<br />
  <strong>v) Schematic Lending</strong><br />
                  Under Schematic Lending, credit is  extended directly under Government schemes such as Integrated Rural Development  Programme (IRDP), Special Rice production Programme (SRPP), Biogas Scheme,  Massive Agricultural Production Programme (MAPP), etc. The subsidy portion  under these loans was reimbursed to the banks by the government. Loans under  schematic lending may either be a short or a term loan.<br />
  <strong>vi) Multi-Agency Approach</strong> <br />
                  The Multi-Agency Approach was  adopted as an over all national policy since 1970 as no single agency had the  necessary organizat­ional structure or financial strength to meet the total  credit requirements of farmers.<br />
                  Multi-agency approach to finance  agriculture was accepted based on the recommendation of All India Rural Credit  Review Committee (1969). The committee observed that the co-operatives alone  though they had increased their coverage since 1950 both in terms of membership  and finance provided, would not be in a position to meet the increasing  requirements of credit. The committee also pointed out that a large number of  PACS are not viable and therefore these could be regarded as inadequate and  unsatisfactory agencies for the distribution of production credit. It was of  the view that both commercial banks and co-operative credit societies can play  a complementary role without getting into conflict with each other. At present,  many agencies, viz., commercial banks, co-operative credit societies and  Regional Rural Banks, are significantly operating in the field of agricultural  finance.<br />
  <strong>Problems</strong><br />
                  RBI constituted a working group in  1976 under the chairmanship of C.E.Kamath to go into the problems of  inefficiency in disbursal of credit under multi-agency approach in agricultural  financing. The main findings were:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>The existence of a number of financing agencies in a common area of  operation and disbursement of credit in an uncoordinated manner has resulted in  multiple financing, over- financing, under financing and diversion of loan  amount to unproductive purposes.</li>
                  <li>Credit agencies could not formulate a meaningful agricultural development  plan on an area basis.</li>
                  <li>Recovery of loans becomes difficult as more than one credit agency claim,  on the same income / security.</li>
                  <li>Problems arise due to different systems, procedures  and policies in lending bydifferent agencies. Differences exist  in the spheres of timelines in sanctioning credit, sanctioning powers, security  norms, service and supervisory charges, recovery performance and procedures, etc.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>vii) Area Approach</strong><br />
                  The National Credit Council was set up in December 1967  to determine the priorities of bank credit among various sectors of the  economy. The NCC appointed a study group on the organizational framework for  the implementation of social objectives in October, 1968 under the Chairmanship  of Prof. D R Gadgil. The study group found that the Commercial Banks had  penetrated only 5000 villages as of June, 1967 and out of the institutional  credit to agriculture, at 39 per cent, the share was negligible at 1per cent,  the balance being met by the co-operatives. The Banking needs of the rural  areas in general and backward in particular were not taken care of by the  Commercial Banks. Besides, the credit needs of Agriculture, SSI and allied  activities remained neglected. Therefore, the group recommended the adoption of  an area approach for bridging the spatial and structural credit gaps  (www.slbckerala.com/pdf/leadbank28_7_09.pdf).  <br />
                  Later, All India Rural Credit Review Committee 1969  endorsed the view that commercial banks (CBs) should increasingly come forward  to finance activities in rural areas. RBI accepted the recommendation and  formulated the Lead Bank Scheme (LBS) in December, 1969 Under the Scheme, each  district had been assigned to different banks (public and private) to act as a  consortium leader to coordinate the efforts of banks in the district  particularly in matters like branch expansion and credit planning. The LBS did  not envisage a monopoly of banking business to Lead Bank in the District. The  Lead Bank was to act as a consortium leader for co-coordinating the efforts of  all credit institutions in each of the allotted districts for expansion of  branch banking facilities and for meeting the credit needs of the rural  economy. In the meanwhile, nationalization of 14 major Commercial Banks in July  1969 (and another 6 banks in 1980), paved the way for bringing about dramatic  changes in their operations. One of the important changes ushered in  immediately, was the expansion of the branch network in the unbanked areas with  a view to bridge spatial gaps. Banks were directed to open a large number of  branches in unbanked rural and semi-urban areas.</p>
                <p><strong>i) Allotment of  Districts among the Lead Banks</strong><br />
                  All the districts in the country excepting the  metropolitan cities of Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and Union Territories of  Chandigarh, Delhi and Goa were allotted among public sector banks and a few  private sector banks. Later on, the Union Territories of Goa, Daman and Diu as  also the rural areas of the Union Territories of Delhi and Chandigarh have been  brought within the purview of LBS.<br />
  <strong>ii) Impressionistic  Surveys and Branch Expansion </strong><br />
                  The Lead Banks conducted impressionistic surveys during  1969 – 70 in their districts to identify the potential for branch expansion and  invoke the co-operation of other banks operating in the district for branch  expansion and financing the various union industries. This has resulted in  massive branch expansion in the unbanked and under banked areas.<br />
  <strong>iii) Formation of  District Consultative Committees (DCCs)</strong><br />
                  The next important development in the history of LBS was  the constitution of DCCs in all the districts, in the early seventies to  facilitate co-ordination of activities of all the Banks and the financial  institutions on the one hand and Government departments on the other. The DCCs  were constituted in the lead districts during 1971 – 73. <br />
  <strong>iv) Study Groups on  Lead Bank Scheme in Gujarat and Maharashtra</strong><br />
                  RBI constituted two study groups to study the working of  the LBS in Gujarat and Maharashtra as per the decision taken in the Regional  Consultative Committee (Western Region) held in August 1975. The group  submitted a common report in December 1975 in view of the similarity of the  problems. The group made several important recommendations regarding  composition and functioning of DCCs, training needs of the staff of banks and  state governments constitution of a standing committee in RBI for reviewing the  overall progress of LBS etc. RBI constituted the “High Power Committee on the  working of LBS” in 1976 as per the recommendation of the Committee. As rapid  branch expansion had taken place by then, the group recommended implementation  of the next phase of the LBS – viz., formulation and implementation of area  development programme covering activities in priority sectors to fill the  sectoral credit gap. This marked the beginning of a crucial phase in LBS.<br />
  <strong>v) District Credit  Plan (DCP)</strong><br />
                  The second and most important phase of the LBS was  formulation of DCPs and their implementation. Although certain structural  credit gaps were identified earlier, positive measures were introduced only  after nationalization of the banks. Certain sectors which were hitherto  neglected were given a priority status and banks were asked to provide credit  to these sectors in a more concerted way. Priority sector included agriculture,  small scale industries (SSI), small road and water transport operators, retail  trade and small business, education, self-employed persons, etc. It was made  mandatory for the CBs to deploy a stipulated percentage of credit for priority  sector. It was fixed at 33.30 per cent of outstanding credit by March 1979 and  40 per cent by March 1985 onwards. Within the priority sector, sub-targets were  prescribed for agriculture and allied activities and weaker sections. <br />
                  The credit planning exercise under the LBS primarily  aimed at overall development of a district through the coordinated efforts of  banks acting in unison with the developmental organs of the State Government at  the district level. The first set of DCPs were prepared and launched in 1978.  In the second round of DCPs (1980 – 82) further refinements were brought out.  The credit outlays under DCPs were now required to be prepared not merely  sector-wise but also bank-wise and block-wise. Besides, within the plan period,  outlays were required to be worked out annually to be Annual Action Plans (AAP)  for each block, bank and sector/sub-sector. The third (1983-85) and fourth  round (1988 - 90) of DCPs and AAPs further contributed to the familiarity of  banks in the mechanism of credit planning. The cooperatives were also involved  in the preparation of DCPs. They too were allotted their share of targets under  priority sector / Government sponsored programmes.<br />
  <strong>vi) Standing  Committee of DCC</strong><br />
                  A task force comprising representatives of DCCBs, CBs  having wide network of branches in the district and District Planning Officials  was set up to assist the lead bank in the preparation of operationally  meaningful DCP and AAP. This task force was converted into a Standing Committee  of DCC for associating it in implementation of the plans. Its membership was  enlarged to include the LDO of RBI, representative of ARDC (now District  Development Managers DDM, NABARD), the Chief Executive of DRDA/ (Zilla  Parishads also) and an official from the Co-operative Department, etc.<br />
  <strong>Vii)  Lead Bank Officers and Lead District Officers</strong><br />
                  The organizational base of the Lead Banks was  strengthened for preparation of DCPs and for its monitoring and implementation.  RBI advised them in 1979 to appoint Lead Bank Officer (normally called Lead  District Manager (LDM) in each district for the purpose. Simultaneously, RBI  appointed Lead District Officers (LDOs) who were allotted 4 or 5 districts each  and were entrusted with the responsibilities of overseeing the preparation and  implementation of DCPs in the allotted districts.<br />
  <strong>Forums  under Lead Bank Scheme for Co-ordination and Monitoring</strong></p>
                <p>            Lead Bank Scheme (LBS) was evolved as a framework to be  more responsive to the needs of the rural economy. The objectives of the scheme  cannot be achieved unless rural lending is properly tied to well designed  programmes of development. This calls for effective co-operation and  co-ordination not only between credit institutions but also between the credit  institutions but also between the credit institutions on the one hand and the  concerned Government and other development agencies on the other. Appropriate  forums had to be created where these two agencies can meet periodically to  discuss operational issues arising from the implementation of scheme evolved by  both Government and the Banks. Initially forums were set up at the District and  State Level.<br />
                    <strong>State  Level Banker’s Committee (SLBC)</strong><br />
                    <strong>Status  of the Committee</strong><br />
                  The State Level Bankers’ Committee  (SLBC) is an inter-institutional forum for co-ordination and joint  implementation of development programmes and policies by all the financial  institutions operating in a State. Although SLBC is envisaged as a Bankers’  forum, Government officials are also included. The Committee is expected to  discuss issues, consider alternative solutions to the various problems in the  field of balanced development and evolve a consensus for coordinated action by  the member institutions. All the member institutions are therefore expected to  approach the Committee’s task in a spirit of co-ordination and intimate  involvement without which the Committee is likely to lose its utility. These  committees are to consider all problems requiring inter-bank coordination at  the policy and implementation level. SLBCs are also expected to recommend to  State Government, measures which would facilitate intensive involvement of  banks and effective co-ordination with extension agencies for all round banking  development. Based on the guidelines issued by Government of India, RBI  designated in 1976-77 one of the Lead Banks to act as State Level Conveners of  the SLBC. <br />
  <strong>Functions  of the Convener Bank</strong><br />
                  • Maintain co-ordination in the functioning of different  financial institutions operating in the State in implementation of various  developmental programmes (both Central and State).<br />
                  • Consider problems requiring inter-bank co-ordination,  matters relating to banking development, etc., requiring State Level attention.<br />
                  • To conduct SLBC meetings, Steering Committee meetings  and annual SLRM depending upon the requirement.<br />
                  • To take up for consideration the issues raised by  member banks and the State authorities which remain unresolved in the District  Consultative Committees (DCCs)/ District Level Review Committee meetings  (DLRCs).<br />
                  • To serve as a focal point for the banking system as a  whole in the State in order to secure better liaison with the State Government  authorities and apex institutions like RBI / NABARD / SIDBI, etc.<br />
                  • To disseminate guidelines and policy matters to all the  member banks and others concerned regularly.<br />
                  • To allocate targets in  co-ordination with State Government under different  Government sponsored schemes.<br />
                  • To collect and consolidate feed back  reports from Banks/State Government departments and Lead Dist. Managers for  preparing agenda notes for SLBC / Steering Committee / SLRM.<br />
                  • To attend State Level Meetings convened by various  departments / organization on behalf of Banks as Convener of SLBC and to  initiate necessary follow up thereof.<br />
  <strong>Liaison  with State Governments</strong><br />
                  The SLBC is expected to serve as a focal point for the  Banking system in every state for securing better liaison with State Government  authorities. The State Governments have been advised of the constitution of  these committees and it is desired that the convener Banks approach State  Government authorities and apprise them of the activities of these Committees.<br />
  <strong>Review  of the Functioning of District Consultative Committees</strong><br />
                  The problems should be brought before the State Level  Bankers’ Committees by the Lead Banks concerned. Agreed decisions could then be  communicated by all the participating institutions to their respective field  for action in the concerned districts.<br />
  <strong>District  Credit Plans (DCP)</strong><br />
                  Inter-institutional co-ordination is of critical importance  in the formulation and implementation of the District Credit Plans. This aspect  may, therefore, be regularly examined by the SLBCs. Allocation of shares in the  District Credit Plans should invariably be ratified by the Regional / Zonal  Managers of the Banks participating in the district plans concerned. <br />
  <strong>Uniformity  in Terms and Conditions of Lending</strong><br />
                  While the terms and conditions governing the advances are  determined by each bank keeping in view various factors such as cost of  mobilizing resources, operational costs, security requirements, etc. wide  variations in these conditions from bank to bank creates avoidable confusion  and resentment in the minds of the borrowers. This is particularly so where  several institutions are participating, if at least in respect of advances to  be granted under specific schemes the banks strive to achieve certain  uniformity in terms and conditions governing their advances. </p>
                <p><strong>Review  of Credit Flows</strong><br />
                  The State Level Bankers’ Committees could become a very  useful forum for reviewing the trends in the flow of credit into rural areas  and to the small borrowers in the neglected sectors. An important prerequisite  for such reviews is the availability of data. Recently, a system of statistical  reporting for the use of the District Level Consultative and the state Level  Co-ordination Committees, evolved by a Study Group, has been introduced. The  State Level Bankers’ Committees could also purposefully review the picture  revealed by the data compiled in accordance with the new system of returns and  take follow up measure to secure speedy disposal of loan applications, to  improve the pace of credit assistance under specific programmes.<br />
  <strong>District  Consultative Committee (DCC)</strong><br />
  <strong>Constitution</strong><br />
                  The DCC has been constituted at the instance of Banking  Commission (1972) and is a common forum for bankers as well as Government  officials to find solution to problems in implementing schemes under LBS. The  DCC came into existence more or less voluntarily because of the felt need for  consultation in the matter of District development schemes. Over the years, it  has evolved as an integral part of the LBS.<br />

                  1. Obtaining  necessary background notes and data from financial institutions, Government  departments and other agencies to prepare comprehensive agenda notes for DCC  meeting.<br />
                  2. Convening the  meeting by issuing notice and agenda notes to the members sufficiently in  advance, say, 15 days.<br />
                  3. Recording the  proceedings of the meeting. The proceedings should bring out clearly the  discussions and decisions arrived at. The agencies responsible for taking  further action on the decisions together with the time schedule for such action  should be indicated in the proceedings. The concerned agencies should provide  necessary feedback to DCC regarding the action taken on the decisions. The  items not advised before hand but raised in the meeting should be listed  separately in the proceedings.<br />
                  4. Circulating  minutes to the member of DCC, all banks, financial institutions, Government  departments, etc., within a fortnight.<br />
                  5. Following up  issues requiring action by banks, other financial agencies and Government  departments.<br />
                  6. To act as resource  person for the entire banking sector in the lead district so far as the  implementation of credit plan is concerned.<br />
                  7. While ensuring that  DCC becomes a compact forum for meaningful discussions, it is necessary to  secure an arrangement for adequate rapport between DCC and those institutions  which are not represented on it on a permanent basis. The LDM should function  as the focal point of such co-ordination by convening regularly, meetings with  the District co-ordinators of all non-lead banks and other financial  institutions. These meetings could be held well in advance of DCC meetings so  that the problems thrown up could be takes up at the DCC forum. LDOs of RBI and  representative of NABARD may also be invited for such meetings.</p>

  <strong>Periodicity of  meeting                      </strong>Quarterly.<br />
                  The joint forum for consultation and monitoring of DCPs  under LBS had been created only upto district level and not block level. But  some of the states Governments had set up block level committees or Task Forces  for monitoring implementation of special programme like SGSY, SJSRY, PMRY,  SLRS, 20 Point Programme, etc. Commercial Banks extended necessary co-operation  and participate in the discussion but do not convene the meetings/act as  conveners; this being done by BDO in some states. State Governments have  advised that meeting may be held at Block and Branch premises alternatively to  invoke better co-operation. Matters of policy issues, case of individual  borrowers are not discussed / decided in such meetings but are referred to  higher ups/DCC. However, with the adoption of service area approach RBI has  advised formation of a Block-Level Bankers’ Committee (BLBC) to co-ordinate the  activities of the banks and the Government officials. All the banks operating  in the block, including DCCB, LDB and RRB would be members of this committee.  In addition, the Block Development Officer and the Technical officers in block  looking after agriculture, industries, animal husbandry, etc., would also be  the members. <br />

  <strong>Constraints in the Lead Bank  Scheme</strong><br />
                  i)  The district credit plan is formulated on the basis of existing  infra-structural facilities and on the assumption of future development plans  as envisaged in the five year plans (FYP). But there is delay in the  development of such infrastructu­ral facilities.<br />
                  ii)  Non-availability-of raw materials and escalation of their costs  affect the technical and economic feasibilities.<br />
                  iii)  The execution of this programme is not the exclusive responsibility of the Lead  bank. Other banks are equally responsible for the implementation of the  programme. Under such circumstances, lack of co-ordination among lending and  other development agencies affect the implementation of various programmes.<br />
  <strong>vii)  Village Adoption Scheme (VAS)</strong><br />
                  Concomitant to LBS, the other form of area approach in  operation was VAS, under which bank adopted some villages in their command area  for intensive lending. The area approach was not so much aimed at development  of a chosen area as for avoiding the pitfalls of scattered and unsupervised  lending. In the initial stages of VAS, RBI has encouraged banks to adopt  villages as well as to avoid scattered lending. A study carried out by the RBI  in 1980 revealed that the VAS as practiced mainly served to exclude other banks  from going to the adopted villages of one bank for financing, without ensuring  that the branch adopting the villages paid adequate attention for meeting their  credit needs. The RBI, therefore, issued guidelines in December 1980 spelling  out that adoption of villages by a bank essentially should amount to a  declaration of its intention to intensify its efforts therein and should not  mean that other banks are precluded from financing in the area.<br />
                  Village  Adoption Scheme was first conceived by State Bank of India with an intension to  finance small farmers under the area approach strategy. The scheme aims at  deriving, in full, the advantages accruing from concentrated and coordinated  efforts in areas with significant agricultural development potential and having  a large number of small and marginal farms. It is for the bank to take special  interest in the development of the village it has adopted, in co-ordination  with other agencies functioning in that area.<br />
                  The banks have to undertake detailed  survey of the village and prepare development plans. These plans have to be  implemented with constant follow-up action. And the banks have to evaluate the  performance of productive activities for which loan are given.<br />
  <strong>Constraints</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Banks  treat and publicize a village as 'adopted' even though only a few of its residents  had been granted loan</li>
                  <li>In  practice, banks do not adopt a remote village <strong>or </strong>poorly developed village.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Performance</strong><br />
                  At the end of June 1983 banks had  adopted 141, 042 villages and financed 5.10 lakh direct agricultural loan  accounts involving an amount of Rs1,557 crores (outstanding).<br />
  <strong>Emergence of  Service Area Approach</strong><br />
                  There was a need to have a close  look at the quality of lending. It has been observed that during the five years  ended 1985-86, the gross value added in agricultural sector registered a growth  rate of 2.70per cent per annum. The share of agriculture in the total net  domestic product at factor cost (at 1970-71 prices) declined from 39.80 per  cent 35.40 per cent. The production of food grains increased marginally from  133.30 million tonnes to 150.50 million tonnes, an increase by 18per cent with  considerable regional disparities. The rate of growth in the consumption of  fertilizers was also similar. In contrast, there was 41 per cent increase in  the outstanding level of credit for agriculture from all the three rural  lending agencies viz., Co-operatives, RRBs and CBs between June 1981 and June  1986. State-wise comparison of production of food grains vis-à-vis outstanding  bank credit showed wide disparities. The share of Haryana, Punjab and U.P. in  total food grains production was around 38per cent. These States accounted for  as much as 75 per cent increase in the food grains output. However, their share  in the total institutional credit was 22 per cent only. While some of the  states in the Eastern Region and also Madhya Pradesh have done well in recent  years, stagnation or decline in food grain production was noticed in Himachal  Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala  which account for 41 per cent of the area under food grain crops and  comparatively a high proportion of institutional credit for agriculture.<br />
                  In the context of these variations, the massive increase  in rural lending, as also the further increase in such credit deployment in the  years to come, it was considered opportune to assess the impact which credit  from banks has had on the overall economic development of the rural sector in  general and agricultural production and in productivity in particular, through  a study. With this objective in view, the Governor of RBI suggested to the  Chief Executives of Public Sector Banks at a meeting held on 17.10.87 that a  field study should be carried out in different districts all over the country.  Accordingly, studies were conducted in 88 districts spread over 21 states in  November / December 1987and reports were submitted to RBI. The findings of the  field studies were discussed in a seminar convened by RBI on 9th and 10th  January 1988. It was attended by the Chairman of Public Sector Banks, top  executives from the Government of India and the national level institutions.  Honourable Finance Minister and Minister of State for Finance addressed the  Seminar. The findings of these studies threw up a major deficiency in the rural  credit system viz., weak link between bank credit and production, productivity  and income levels. Scattered lending over wide area diluted the quality of  lending. Post disbursement supervision was paid little or no attention. Several  suggestions were made at the seminar for strengthening the existing rural  credit delivery system with a view to improving the quality of lending in rural  areas. <br />
                  The most important suggestion by all the participants was  the endorsement of the new approach to rural lending viz., <strong>SERVICE AREA  APPROACH,</strong> whereby each rural and semi-urban branch of a Commercial Bank  (including RRB) would be assigned a designated area in which it could make  planned efforts towards area development in co-ordination with all the  extension and development agencies of the State Government. Large scale  expansion of branches in rural and semi-urban areas facilitated the shift. <br />
                  Manifestation of area approach began  in the form of Lead Bank Scheme under which a particular commercial bank was  expected to assume a lead role in a particular district. Other financial  institutions and developmental agencies were expected to work in<strong> </strong>co-ordination with the designated lead bank.<br />
                  Another manifestation of area  approach at a comparatively micro level has been in the form of ‘Adoption of  villages’ for intensive lending. By mutual understanding amongst banks  operating in the area, it was usually agreed that the bank adopting the  particular village will meet the<strong> </strong>entire credit needs of the village.</p>
                <p>Yet  another manifestation of area approach which many of the banks have evolved  more or less spontaneously is the formulation of area specific projects.  Project formulation is undertaken keeping in  view the credit potential and compactness of the area around one or more of the  branch offices of the bank for effective implementation of the programme of  lending.<br />
                  With a view to improve the linkage  between the bank credit and its objectives viz., increasing the production,  enhancing the productivity of resources and raising the income of rural  population, the RBI advised the Chief Executives of public sector<strong> </strong>banks to personally carry out field visits in rural areas of  different districts all over the country.   A seminar by the top executives of banks and GOI was held in January  1988 wherein it was decided to launch the Service Area Approach (SAA) and hence  SAA was commenced from April 1, 1989.<br />
  <strong>Stages of Implementation of  SAA</strong><br />
                  SAA  comprises of the following stages:<br />
  <strong>i) Identification of the  service area for each bank branch</strong><br />
                  The rural and semi-urban branches of  commercial banks and RRBs will be allotted with all the 5.67lakh villages in  the country. Each branch will cover 15 to 25 villages. Proximity to the  branches and contiguity of the villages are the main criteria for the allotment  of villages. Where more than one branch qualifies for allotment of a particular  village, allotment is made to the branch which has a dominant share in lending  for the particular village.<br />
  <strong>ii.) Survey of the villages  in the Service Area</strong><br />
                  The branch managers should undertake  survey of villages in order to assess lending potential for different  activities and identification of beneficiaries for assistance. The survey  should also cover infrastructural facilities and linkages availa<strong>­</strong>ble in the area. It should be completed within four months from  the date of allotment of service area.<br />
  <strong>iii) Preparation of credit  plan on an annual basis for the service area by each branch          </strong><br />
                  An Annual credit plan has to be  prepared based on the survey report. The RRBs prepare credit plan for the  target group and the designated bank branch will prepare for non-target group.  Branches should take note of the lending programmes of PACS and PLDBs while  finalizing the plan. They should get a list of borrowers from co-operatives to  avoid double financing. Programmes such as Integrated Rural Development  Programme (IRDP), Self-Employment for Educated Unemployed Youth (SEEUY) and  Self Employment for Urban poor (SEPUP) form a part of credit plan.</p>
                <p><strong> iv) Co-ordination between credit institutions  and development agencies for effective implementation of   credit plans.</strong><br />
                    <strong>v) A continuous system of  monitoring the progress in the implementation of plans and individual schemes.</strong><br />
                    <strong>SAA has the following advantages</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>it  facilitates intensive deployment of credit for develop­ment purposes, keeping  in view the local needs and problems;</li>
                  <li>it  facilitates identification of borrowers and activities needing of credit;</li>
                  <li>it facilitates supervision of use of credit  and recovery of credit;</li>
                  <li>it facilitates co-ordination with the other  financial and developmental institutions operating in the area, in the interest  of development of that area; </li>
                  <li>it facilitates monitoring of impact of credit  on the living standards of the area, which is the ultimate objective of rural  development.</li>
                  <li>The service area approach allocates each and every village for adoption irrespective of its existing  socio-economic condition which was the main consideration in the earlier  village adoption approach with the result that the villages which were  potential for increasing branch business profitably, were got adopted. Under  SAA, there is village adoption under <em>compulsion </em>through committee intervention for rural development while in the village  adoption approach there was optional village adoption without outside  intervention. In SAA, there is equity and inVAS there was discrimination.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>            The village profile has to be  updated once in a year by means of periodic visits of the villages and  establishing a continuous contact with the extension and development agencies.  The credit plan should reflect both the needs and potentials of the area. In  drawing up a credit plan, the branch manager should keep in<strong> </strong>view the essential aspects such as the extent to which credit­ deposit  ratio should be improved during the year, number of units to be financed under  different activities under various schemes, credit targets to be fulfilled, the  availability of required physical inputs etc. The branch manager is advised to  arrange funds for implementing the credit plan by mobilizing savings, by  effecting recovery of dues and over dues, by setting refinance and by borrowing  funds from other inter bank branches. SAA ensures planned credit deployment and  prevents duplication of financing.<br />
                    <strong>Constraints  of SAA</strong> <br />
                  a) All the demands of the villages may  not be met by the designated bank branch due to financial constraints<br />
                  b) Branches located in areas where co-operatives are very strong, will have  to restrict their lending.<br />
                  c) Because  of larger area of operation, banks officials could not concentrate on lending,  supervising and recovery of loans.<br />
                  d) Rural  people lose their right of choosing their own bank. If the service area bank  could not lend, farmers could not get loan elsewhere. <br />
                  The operational aspects of implementing this approach  were examined in depth by a Committee appointed for the purpose under the  Chairmanship of Dr. P.D Ojha, Deputy Governor of RBI. The members of the  Committee, among others were the Chairmen of some public sector banks. In the  absence of sufficient knowledge about the potential within command area, these  targets tended to be unrealistic.<br />
  <strong>Important  Recommendations of Dr. Ojha Committee</strong><br />
                  The Committee opined that the Lead Bank Scheme has helped  in bringing a great deal of co-ordination between Banks and Government  departments through forums established at the district and state levels. But,  as the district development plans and branch performance budgets could not be  dovetailed with the DCPs and AAPs prepared under the scheme, they could not  acquire the full status of operationally relevant plans for implementation. The  lack of involvement of Branch Mangers in the preparation of plans was also  responsible for the plans not becoming meaningful to them. Under these  circumstances, an alternative system as suggested in the Seminar appears to be  more conducive to develop productive lending. <br />
                  The issue of demarcation of area as advocated by the  working group on multi-agency approach on Agricultural Finance was formalized  with the advent of SAA. The committee also expressed that such an approach  would have distinct advantages in the dispensation of credit. Firstly, it  enables the branches to pay concentrated attention on the development of the  area. Secondly, as the multi-agency approach has to some extent, resulted in  duplication of efforts, a new approach may help in avoiding the same. Thirdly,  the scattered lending over wide areas would give way to organized lending.  Fourthly, it would make it easier for the Branch Managers to effectively  monitor the end-use of credit and assess the impact on increase in the levels  of production, productivity and incomes of the beneficiaries. Fifthly, as the  plans would be drawn up by the branch manager, he  would develop a sense of pride, motivation  and involvement in the success of this <br />
                  plans.<br />
  <strong>Capital  Rationing</strong> </p>
                <p>            Capital Rationing refers to  allocation of scarce capital resources among competing ends. The concept of  credit rationing is applicable to borrower and. lender. The tendency of the  lender to limit the amount of credit provided to the farm business is known as  external capital rationing. Likewise, the borrower also adopts capital  rationing with his limited capital to derive maximum returns from the  alternative investment choices. This is called internal capital rationing.<br />
                    <strong>Instant Credit Scheme</strong><br />
                  This scheme was introduced during  1991 with the aim of providing credit without any delay to the persons who  repay the loans regularly. Under this scheme, green card is issued to those  members who had repaid the loan promptly in the last three years. By showing  the green card, the member can avail the credit immediately without waiting for  the sanction of loan by the concerned officials. It is expected that this  system will induce the farmers to repay the loan promptly and avail fresh loans  without any delay. The possession of the green card will also give a social  status.<br />
  <strong>Crop Production Loan</strong> <br />
                  Crop Production loans are granted by  the financing institutions for growing crops. This loan amount depends on the  input requirements of the crop and hence it varies with the crop. The loan was  first introduced in 1950 in the erst­while Bombay State. Later it was  introduced throughout the country based on the recommendations of All  India-Rural Credit Survey Committee (1954) and the Committee on co-operative  credit (1960). At present, all financing, institutions provide crop loan.<br />
  <strong>Features</strong> <br />
                  The disbursement of loan is made in  cash and kind. A major part of the loan is disbursed in the form of inputs such  as improved seeds, fertilizers and pesticides which ensures its proper  utilization. The repayment of loan is so fixed as to enable the farmer to repay  the loan after marketing the produce. Wherever facilities are available the  credit is linked with marketing to enable the farmer to get better price for  his produce. The banker could also easily recover the loan.  The crop loan is issued either by  hypothecating the crop to the lending institution or based on the personal  security of the farmer.<strong></strong><br />
  <strong>Scale of finance </strong><br />
                  Scale of finance is the credit limit  fixed for each crop based on its cost of cultivation. The DCCB has a major responsibility in convening the  &quot;District Level Technical Committee&quot; on scales of finance (SOF) for  the district. A scale of finance per acre for different  crops is determined on the basis of cost of cultivation. If includes both cash  and kind. These are fixed once a  year before the major crop season in consultation with all the stakeholders.  The key inputs in the exercise are identifying all major crops in the district,  determining their cost of cultivation and the returns that are coming from the  crop and fixing the scale of finance. Since the cost of  cultivation varies with the  region and time uniform scale of finance could not be adopted. The scales of finance are averages and therefore, banks  have the flexibility to offer larger loans than the scales fixed for  enterprising farmers. The process of fixing a scale of finance is very useful  as, it harmonizes the rates across different banks and each bank need not  independently arrive at the SOF.</p>
