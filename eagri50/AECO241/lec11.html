				<p align="center"><strong>AGRICULTURAL  COOPERATION-PHILOSOPHY AND PRINCIPLES. HISTORY OF INDIAN CO-OPERATIVE MOVEMENT,  PRE-INDEPENDENCE AND POST INDEPENDENCE PERIODS, COOPERATION IN DIFFERENT PLAN  PERIODS, COOPERATIVE CREDIT STRUCTURE-PACS, FSCS</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Co-operation  and Co-operative Credit</strong></p>
				<p>            According to Calvert, “Co-operation  is a specialized form of economic organization in which people voluntarily  associate together on a basis of equality for the promotion of their common  economic interests”. <br />
				  A Co-operative Society is an  enterprise formed and directed by an association of users, applying within  itself, the rules of democracy, and directly intended to serve both its own  members and the community as a whole - Lambert.</p>
				<p><strong>Principles  of Co-operation</strong><br />
				  A co-operative society is a special type of business  organization different from other forms of organization. The characteristics /  principles of co-operative society are:</p>
				<p><strong>i) Open Membership  /</strong><strong> Universality</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>The membership of a Co-operative Society is open to all  those who have a common interest, those who are  convinced of its benefits and those who are prepared to share the benefits and  responsibilities involved in such a membership. A minimum of ten members are required to form a  cooperative society. The Co–operative Societies Act does not specify the  maximum number of members for any co-operative society. However, after the  formation of the society, the member may specify the maximum number of members.<strong> </strong> </p>
				<p><strong>ii)  Unity or Political and Religious Neutrality</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Unity  is the fundamental force behind all co-operative organizations. It is above all  beliefs, faiths and convictions.</p>
				<p><strong>iii) Voluntary  Association</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Members join the co-operative society voluntarily, that  is, by choice. A member can join the society as and when he likes, continue for  as long as he likes, and leave the society at will.</p>
				<p><strong>iv)State Control</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>To protect the interest of members, co-operative  societies are placed under state control through registration. While getting  registered, a society has to submit details about the members and the business  it is to undertake. It has to maintain books of accounts, which are to be  audited by government auditors.</p>
				<p><strong>v) Sources of  Finance</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>In a co-operative society, capital is contributed by all  the  members. However, it can easily  raise loans and secure grants from government after its registration.</p>
				<p><strong>vi) Democratic  Management</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Co-operative societies are managed on democratic lines.  The society is managed by a group known as “Board of Directors”. The members of  the board of directors are the elected representatives of the society. Each  member has a single vote, irrespective of the number of shares held. For  example, in a village credit society the small farmer having one share has  equal voting right as that of a landlord having 20 shares.</p>
				<p><strong>vii) Service Motive  /</strong><strong> Limited Interest on Capital</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>The  main aim of the society is not to earn abnormal profit but to enable the  members to improve their economic conditions. If there is any excess income, it  will be used to meet unforeseen loss or strengthening the funds of the society  so that cheaper services may be made available to the members. Co-operatives are not formed to maximize profit like  other forms of business organization. The main purpose of a Co-operative  Society is to provide service to its members. For example, in a Consumer  Co-operative Store, goods are sold to its members at a reasonable price by  retaining a small margin of profit. It also provides better quality goods to  its members and the general public.<strong> </strong></p>
				<p><strong>viii) Separate  Legal Entity</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>A Co-operative Society is registered under the  Co-operative Societies Act. After registration a society becomes a separate  legal entity, with limited liability of its members. Death, insolvency or  lunacy of a member does not affect the existence of a society. It can enter into  agreements with others and can purchase or sell properties in its own name.</p>
				<p><strong>ix) Distribution of  Surplus</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Every co-operative society in addition to providing  services to its members, also generates some profit while conducting business.  Profits are not earned at the cost of its members. Profit generated is  distributed to its members not on the basis of the shares held by the members  (like the company form of business), but on the basis of members’ participation  in the business of the society. For example, in a consumer co-operative store  only a small part of the profit is distributed to members as dividend on their  shares; a major part of the profit is paid as purchase bonus to members on the  basis of goods purchased by each member from the society.</p>
				<p><strong>x) Self-help  through Mutual Cooperation</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Co-operative Societies thrive on the principle of mutual  help. They are the organizations of financially weaker sections of society.  Co-operative Societies convert the weakness of members into strength by  adopting the principle of self-help through mutual co-operation. It is only by  working jointly on the principle of “Each for all and all for each”. The  members can fight exploitation and secure a place in society.<strong> </strong></p>
				<p><strong>xi)  Principles of Publicity</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>The  co-operative organizations do not believe in maintaining secrecy about their  working and progress.</p>
				<p><strong>xii)</strong> Members should have the  spirit of dedication and service with absolute honesty and unquestionable  integrity. Hence, co-operation is the movement of the people, for the people and  by the people.</p>
				<p><strong>History  of Co-operative Movement </strong> <br />
				  Robert Owen  (1771–1858) is considered the father of the cooperative movement. Owen believed  in putting his workers in a good environment with access to education for  themselves and their children. He put his ideas into effect successfully in the  cotton mills of New Lanark, Scotland. It was  here that the first co-operative store was opened. </p>
				<p>            The Famine Commission of 1901  recommended the establishment of Agricultural Banks on the lines of Mutual  Credit Association of Europe to provide credit to farmers in order to prevent  further famine and also to improve agriculture. A Committee under the  presidentship of Sir Edward Law drafted a model bill to establish co –  operative credit societies. The bill was passed as Co-operative Credit  Societies Act on 25th March, l904.</p>
				<p>            Provisions were made in this Act to  establish credit societies both in rural and urban areas for providing credit  facilities at cheap rates to needy people of the locality. Rural societies were  organized on ‘Raiffeisen Model’ while the urban societies were established on  ‘Schulze Delitzch Pattern’. In Raiffeisen Model, unlimited liability was an  important feature while in Schulze Delitzch societies, limited liability  principle was followed. </p>
				<p>            In the event of liquidation of  limited liability societies, the liability of the members is limited to their  share capital or it may be one to five times of the share capital as prescribed  by the by-law of the society. The advantage is that members have confidence  that their property is safe, even if the society is liquidated. In the event of  liquidation of unlimited liability societies, the members lose not only their  share capital but their other properties upto the extent of the loss of the  society. The main advantages of unlimited liability are the mutual trust and  watchfulness it creates among the members.</p>
				<p>            Realizing the defects noticed in the  Co-operative Cre­dit Society Act, 1904, that is, i) no provision for purposes  other than credit, i.e., marketing and ii) unlimited liability, the Government  passed Co-operative Soci­eties Act, 1912. </p>
				<p>            According to this, a) non – credit  societies can also be formed and b) the liability of the central societies  (collection of primary societies) shall be limited and the liability of rural  (primary) societies shall be unlimited. After 1912, there was a rapid growth  not only in the number of co-operative credit societies but also in non - ­agricultural  credit societies. However, the development was not even. It made rapid progress  only in Bombay, Madras and Punjab (where agriculturists had mortgage rights)  than in the Zamindhari areas like Bengal.</p>
				<p>            In 1914, the Government of India  appointed a committee under Sir Edward Maclagan to examine the progress of the  co-operative movement and to suggest measures for improvement. The defects  noticed by the committee were: </p>
				<p>a) Misappropriation of funds by the members of the  management committee,<br />
				  b) Nepotism in advancing loans to friends and relatives,<br />
				  c) Improper auditing and inspection of societies.</p>
				<p>The major  recommendations were: <br />
				  i)  Formation of three classes of societies namely: <br />
				  a) primary meant for individuals and  unions or federation of societies meant for supervision; <br />
				  b) Central bank at district level for  banking business; and <br />
				  c) Provincial bank at the provincial  1evel to serve as apex banks.<br />
				  ii)  Restriction of area under primary society to a village, and<br />
				  iii)  Encouragement of non –credit societies through the financial support by central  banks. </p>
				<p>On passing of the  Government of India Act in 1919 under the Montague Chelmsford Reforms,  co-operation became the provincial subject and was administered by provincial  governments. The economic prosperity between 1920 and 1929 facilitated rapid  increase in the number of societies. However, due to the world wide Great  Depression (1929-34) and the Second World War, the co-operative movement had a  serious set back.</p>

				<p>            Many committees were appointed to  study the progress of co-operative movement. In Madres, Madras Co-operative  Societies Act, 1932 and the Madras Co-operative Land Mortgage Banks Act, 1934  were passed. While the 1932 Act conferred more power on the Registrar with  regard to the recovery of bad debts, audit, supervision and control, the 1934  Act provided for long-term credit through co-operative land mortgage banks. The  Madras Province appointed a Committee on Co-operation (1939) under T.Vijaya  Raghavachary to study the conditions of the co-operative movement in the state.  The committee suggested several amendments to 1932 Act. </p>
				<p>            The Reserve Bank of India was  established in 1935 with an Agricultural Credit Department. The RBI conducted  enquiries and advised the provincial governments to improve the working of credit  societies. The Agricultural Finance Sub Committee (Prof. D.R.Gadgil Committee)  set up in 1944, recommended that the state aid should be increased so that  co-operatives might be enabled to supply better credit facilities. It also  recommended for the adoption of limited liability to the co-operatives. It was  also felt that the co­operatives would be strengthened through linking credit  with marketing, setting up of processing plants by grant of liberal loans and  subsidies, and training of expert staff. </p>
				<p>            In 1945, the Government of India  appointed the Co­operative Planning Committee under the chairmanship of R.G.  Saraiyya for drawing up a plan for future development of the co-operative  movement. It recommended that the rural credit societies should function as  multi-purpose societies so as to attend to all economic activities of the  farmers. It paved the way to linking credit with marketing of agricultural  produce. </p>
				<p><strong>Development  of Co-operatives during Post Independence Period</strong><br />
				  The Rural Banking Enquiry committee  (1949-50) recommended for the formation of Rural Co – operative Banks. The All  India Rural Credit Survey (AIRCS) committee was appointed in 1951 under the  chairmanship of A.D.G Gorwala. The committee brought to light some defects in  the organizational, operational and structural aspects of the co-operative  institutions and stated, “The co-operation in India has failed but it must  succeed as there was no alternative to the co- operative form of association in  the village for the promotion of agricultural credit development”. The  committee recommended an Integrated Scheme of Rural Credit by involving three  fundamental principles namely, i) State participation in co-operative  institutions at different levels, ii) co-ordination of credit with  other economic activities especially  processing and marketing, and iii) administration through training and  efficient personnel responsible to the needs of the rural population.</p>
				<p>            Under the provisions of the  Agricultural Produce (Development and Ware housing) Corporation Act 1956, the  National Co-operative Development and Ware Housing Board was established. The  RBI had established the National Agricultural Credit (Long Term Operations)  Fund in 1956 to provide long-term loans to the state governments for enabling them  to contribute to the share capital of co-operative institutions. It also  created National Agricultural Credit (Stabilization) Fund to enable the short  term credit granted to the co-operatives to be converted into medium term loans  in circumstances in which the co-operatives could not repay short term loans  due to natural calamities. </p>
				<p>            The Committee on Co-operative Credit  (1960) headed by Vaikunt Lal Metha recommended measures to secure a balance  between economic viability and the co-operative ideology, liberalization of  rules and procedures for disbursal of credit. It recommended big sized  societies, granting short-term loans for landless people, linking credit with  marketing, etc.</p>
				<p>            The Madras Full Finance Scheme  Committee 1960 stressed that loan should be given to landless cultivators and  tenants. It emphasized that the production and purpose-oriented credit should  be purveyed to farmers.   <br />
				  An expert committee under Dr.  Dantwala was appointed in 1964. It recommended that the primary marketing  societies should take up both marketing and credit activities. </p>
				<p>            The All India Rural Credit Review  Committee (AIRCRC) was appointed by the RBI under the chairmanship of  B.Venkatappaiah in 1969 to review the progress of rural credit in the context  of IV Five Year Plan. It warned that the lower rung of the rural community  should be financed in terms of social justice and as per the recommendation of  this committee, 45 Small Farmers’ Development Agencies (SFDAs) were established  in the selected districts. The committee recommended for the reorganization of  primary societies into viable societies, rehabilitation of weak central  co-operative banks, etc. Rural Electrification Corporation was also set up in  1969 to promote and finance the rural electricity co-operatives.</p>
				<p><strong>Co-operative  Credit Institutions</strong><br />
            The co-operative credit structure in  India is characterized by two types of institutions: one, involved in the  dispensation of short and medium term credit and the other in the provision of  long term credit. </p>
				<p>            The Primary Agricultural Credit  Society (PACS) / Primary Agricultural Co-operative Bank (PACB) is the  foundation stone on which the whole co-operative credit structure is built up.  These societies are federated to District Central Co-operative Bank (DCCB),  generally at the district level. The DCCBs are federated to State Co-operative  Bank (SCB) which is an apex institution at the state level having close link  with the RBI and NABARD. Long term credit is provided by Land Development Banks  (LDBs). The State / Central Land Development Bank (now renamed as State  Co-operative Agricultural Rural Development Banks (SCARDBs) is the apex  institution which operates through Primary Land Development Banks (PLDBs) (now  renamed as Primary Co-operative Agricultural Rural Development Banks (PCARDBs)  at district / taluk / block level in some states or through its own branches  where PCARDBs do not exist.</p>
				<p><img src="111111" width="603" height="390" /></p>
				<p><strong>a)  Primary Agricultural Credit Society (PACS)</strong><br />
            The  formation of these societies dates back to 1904 when the first Co-operative  Credit Societies Act was passed. The objective was to provide cheap credit to  the farmers in order to relieve them from the clutches of money lenders.  Many PACS also undertake multiple activities like sale of fertilizers and  other agricultural inputs and several act as distributors of ration items under  the Public Distribution System (PDS).The main functions of  the PACS are:</p>
				<ol>
				  <ol>
				    <li>to  promote economic interests of the members in accordance with the co-operative  principles;</li>
				    <li>to  provide short and medium term loans;</li>
				    <li>to  promote savings habit among members;</li>
				    <li>to  supply agricultural inputs like fertilizers, seeds, insecticides and  implements;</li>
				    <li>to  provide marketing facilities for the sale of agricultural produces; and</li>
				    <li>to  supply domestic products requirements such as sugar, kerosene, etc.</li>
			      </ol>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Management</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>The  general body elects a managing committee which consists of five to nine members  and elects a President, Secretary and a Treasurer to look after the day – to –  day functioning of the society. All the office bearers render honorary service.  The RBI has given a directive to appoint a full time paid secretary to maintain  the accounts for each society. </p>
				<p><strong>Membership</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>All  agriculturists, agricultural labourers, artisans and small traders in the  villages can become members of the society.</p>
				<p><strong>Share  Capital</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>PACS  issue ordinary shares of small value depending upon the particular society,  i.e., Rs.10 and Rs.50 each to their members. The ownership of shares decides  the rights and obligations of the holder to the society. Share capital forms an  important part of the working capital. Members’ borrowing capacities were  determined by the number of shares held by them.</p>
				<p><strong>Liability</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Initially,  societies were formed with unlimited liability. The All India Rural Credit  Review Committee pointed out that unlimited liability operates as a restraint  on the willingness of the society to liberalize its loan policies, to admit new  members and to extend its area of operation. Besides, it hinders the society to  receive contribution from the state government whose liability inevitably has  to be limited. In view of these reasons, the societies were formed with limited  liability and the existing societies were converted into limited liability  societies.</p>

                    <strong>            </strong>Share  capital, entrance fee, deposits from members and non-members, reserve fund, and  loans borrowed from higher institutions (Central cooperative Banks, Commercial  Banks and government) and grants and subsidies from the government are the  different sources of funds of the co-operative societies. PACSs obtain loans  from DCCB or SCB to cater to the needs of their members. The maximum borrowing  power of the society is based on its liability and it differs from state to state. It is generally fixed at 1/6th  or ⅛th of the total value of the net assets of the solvent members.  Credit limit is fixed by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or DCCBs on the  basis of the factors viz., total assets of the members, income and repaying  capacity of members, owned funds of the society, audit classification and  repayment performance.</p>
				<p><strong>Loaning  Policies</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>PACSs  supply short-term credit on the personal security of the borrowers, while  medium term credit is given either by creating charge on their immovable assets  or mortgages. Repayment period is determined on the basis of <br />
				  incremental income  derived out of the loan.<br />
  <strong>Progress  of PACS</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>The  percentage of villages covered by PACS in 1990-91 was 97 which would be  positive sign. There have been ups and downs in the ‘Number of PACS’ due to  liquidation of unviable PACS between 1950-51 and 1995-96. The ‘Deposits’ in  PACS are considerably less than the ‘Loan’ taken by them from Central Banks and  Central Financial Agencies (CFAs). Dependence of PACS on Government and Central  Banks / CFAs loan on is viable.</p>
				<p>            The region progress made by PACS is  given in the table below and it would reveal that Western region ranked first  during 2008 in terms of the presence of number of PACS accounting for 31 per  cent of the total number of PACS in India and it was followed by Eastern Region  (19 per cent), Southern Region (16 per cent) and so on.. As regards the  borrowing, Southern Region ranking first accounting for 42.3 per cent of the  total loan amount outstanding and it was followed by Northern Region (21.0 per  cent), Western Region (20.6 per cent) and so on. Thus, there is an imbalance in  the growth of credit co-operatives in India. The percentage of overdues to  demand at all India level was 35.7 per cent.</p>
				<p>            In order to reorganize and  revitalize the non – viable credit co-operatives, the government took several  measures which are discussed below:</p>
				<p><strong>Regulation  of PACS</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>As a  policy of reorganization of PACS into viable units, the number of societies had  been brought from 1,61,000 in 1970-71 to 82,905 in 1990-91. The reorganization  programmes envisaged the following aspects: </p>
				<ol>
				  <ol>
				    <ol>
				      <li>Minimum short-term loan of  Rs.2 lakhs for a society to become a viable unit.</li>
				      <li>Coverage of villages with a  gross cropped area of 2000 ha to achieve this level of business.</li>
				      <li>Appointment of a suitably  trained full – time paid secretary to manage its affairs.</li>
			        </ol>
			      </ol>
			    </ol>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>            The National Bank has formulated a  scheme known as instant fresh finance scheme during 1988-89 to issue timely  fresh credit to those members of PACS who have repaid their early dues. This  policy improvement should go a long way to build confidence of the members in  their co-operative society as no member was allowed fresh loan irrespective of  whether he has paid or not repaid the loan when the society as such was  declared ineligible for fresh financing.</p>

                <p><strong>Task  Force on Revival of Rural Cooperative Credit Institutions Chaired by Prof. A.  Vaidyanathan </strong><br />
                  In August 2004, the Government of  India set up a Task Force to suggest an action plan for reviving rural  cooperative credit institutions and legal measures necessary for facilitating  this process.</p>
                <p>            The Task Force, chaired by Prof. A.  Vaidyanathan, has recommended that any financial restructuring without  addressing the root causes of the weaknesses of the system would not result in  its sustained revival. This would require legal measures for enabling  cooperatives to evolve into democratic, self-governing and financially  well-managed institutions.</p>
                <p>            The Vaidyanathan Committee has also  suggested a model cooperative law that can be enacted by the state governments.  In states, where there are already two laws, the old Coopera­tive Societies Act  and the new Act on the lines of the Model Cooperatives Act, it would be better  to gradually converge and have only one Act so as to reduce confusion and legal  problems. </p>
                <p>The major  recommendations of the task force are as follows:</p>
                <p>            The revival package suggested by the  Vaidyanathan Committee is a financial package for wiping off accumulated  losses, covering invoked but unpaid guarantees given by State Governments,  increasing the capital to a specified minimum level, retir­ing government share  capital and technical assistance. It has also laid down the eligibility  criteria for institutions, amongst which implementation of the recommendations  for legal and institutional reform is an important condition. </p>
                <p><strong>i) Structural  Changes in Primary Agricultural Co-operative Banks</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>The PACS should confine their activities only to rural  credit and they should not get themselves involved in the non-credit activities  like PDS, etc. Therefore, it is suggested that Primary Co-operative Marketing  Societies may be promoted for running the fair price shops.</p>
                <p><strong>ii) Co-operation  within co-operatives</strong> <br />
                  The SHGs could be made members of the co-operative  society. Each Primary Agricultural Cooperative Society shall be a  conglomeration of self-help groups, as each SHG is a “Micro Co-operative  Society” and this will ensure division of not only power but also an  empowerment for the members.</p>
                <p><strong>iii) Single Window  Lending</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Long-term loans could be provided to the farmers by the  District Central Co-operative Banks. This will enable the farmers to avail of  all their credit needs from a single institution. TNCSARDB could be merged with  the Tamil Nadu State Apex Co-operative Bank and PCARDBs could become branches  of District Central Cooperative Banks.</p>
                <p><strong>iv) Member’s’  Accountability and Members’ Participation</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>In the absence of members’ participation, the Board of  Management and the officials misuse their position and mismanage the affairs of  the societies. The members should jointly work to derive the benefits from the  society. To promote the members’ interest and welfare, the committee suggested  formation of sub-committees viz., Members’ Grievances Committee, Loan Committee,  Recovery and Relief Committee, Resources Management Committee and Elected  Advisory Committee from the above subcommittees etc.,<strong> </strong></p>
                <p>v)  Cooperatives will need assistance to computerize themselves and install sound  accounting and monitoring systems to remain competitive. </p>
                <p>vi) All PACS, which presently have a recovery  rate of at least 50 per cent and whose gross margin covers at least 50 per cent  of their establishment costs should be covered under the package. The DCCBs with positive net worth and those with  negative net worth but with less than 25 per cent deposit erosion may be taken  up under the package for revival. The same criteria will also apply to SCBs. </p>
                <p>vii) All cooperative banks would be on par  with the commercial banks as far as regulatory norms are concerned.</p>
                <p>vii) State governments may issue Executive  Orders to bring in the desired reforms relating to: (i) ensuring full voting  membership rights on all users of financial services including depositors; and  (ii) removing state intervention in administrative and financial matters in  cooperatives.</p>
                <p>            The task  force recommended a financial package of Rs. 14,839 crore for rural credit  co-operative institutions. Based on the consensus arrived at with the state  governments and other stakeholders on the recommendations made by the task  force, the central government approved the revival package that involves  financial assistance of Rs 13,596 crore.        NABARD  has been designated as the implementing agency for the revival of the  short-term cooperative credit scheme. </p>
                <p>            A  Department for Cooperative Revival and Reforms has been set up in the head  office of NABARD for facilitating the implementation process. For guiding and  monitoring the implementation of the revival package, a National-Level  Implementing and Monitoring Committee (NIMC) has been set up under the  chairmanship of the governor of the RBI. The provision of financial assistance  under the package has been linked to reforms in the cooperative sector. In  order to avail financial assistance under the package, the state governments  are required to sign a MoU with NABARD, committing to implement the legal,  institutional and other reforms as envisaged in the revival package. So far,  eight state governments, namely, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan,  Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Uttrakhand have signed MoUs with the  Government of India, and four other state governments, namely, Punjab, Bihar,  Tamil Nadu and Sikkim, have conveyed their consent for participation in the  revival package. </p>

                <p><strong>b)  District Central Co-operative Banks (DCCBs)</strong><br />
CCB / DCCBs form an  important link between PACS and SCBs.<br />
<strong>Functions</strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>The  major functions of CCB / DCCBs are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>to meet the credit  requirements of member societies; </li>
                  <li>to perform banking  business;to act as balancing centres for the PACS by diverting the surplus  funds of some societies to those which face shortage of funds;</li>
                  <li>to guide and supervise the  PACS; and </li>
                  <li>to undertake non-credit  activities.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The area of operation  is generally a district. All types of co-operative societies such as marketing  societies, consumers' societies, farming societies and urban co-operative  credit societies apart from PACS can become member of CCB / DCCBs.</p>
                <p><strong>Sources  of Finance</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>These  banks raise funds by way of share capital, deposits from public, borrowings  from SCBs, government, RBI, SBI and commercial banks. The borrowing power of  these banks ranges from 12 to 15 times of their paid-up share capital and  reserve fund.<strong></strong></p>
                <p><strong>Loaning  Policy</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>These  banks generally extend short and medium term loans to PACS for financing  agricultural activities. Loans are granted against proper security, landed  assets, house mortgage, cattle, agricultural produce, jewels etc. </p>
                <p>The number of CCB /  DCCBs has declined due to reorganization. Because of various reasons, the  percentage of overdue has increased from 8.7 per cent in 1950 -51 to 43 per cent  in 1990-91.</p>

                  The management of these banks is  vested with Board of Directors consisting of 12 to 15 members. A DCCB is  considered weak when its estimated bad and doubtful debts, other over dues  above three years and accumulated losses exceed 50 percent of its paid-up  capital and reserves. Rehabilitation programme is being implemented to  revitalize such weak DCCB. A<a href="http://them.AS">s</a> on June 30, 1988, as many as 176 DCCBs were identified as  weak and put under rehabilitation programme.</p>
                <p><strong>c)  State Co-operative Bank (SCB)</strong><br />
                  It is the apex institution at the  state level which links widely scattered PACS with the money market, Reserve  Bank of India and the Cooperative movement. The main objective of the bank is  to link the widely scattered PACS with the money market and the RBI and to  co-ordinate the work of CCB / DCCBs.</p>
                <p><strong>The  Functions of SCBs are:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>to act as bankers' bank to  DCCBs and to supervise, control and guide them;</li>

                  <li>to co-ordinate the various  development agencies and he1p the government in drawing plans for co-operative  development and their implementation;</li>
                  <li>to formulate and execute  uniform credit policies for co-operative movement; </li>
                  <li>to perform banking functions  such as issuing cheques, drafts, letters of credit (by issuing letter of  credit, a banker requests another party (a banker or trader) to grant a  specified amount to a third party specified therein and the issuing banker  himself binds to pay the money paid under the letter of credit), collecting and  discounting bills, etc.</li>

                <p><strong>Area  of Operation and Membership</strong><br />
                  Area of operation is within the  state. Each state has one apex bank. Some States have more than one as in  Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh. </p>
                <p>            Membership is open to all CCB /  DCCBs and such other societies, which have direct dealings with SCBs and State  Governments, have now become shareholders in order to strengthen and influence  their borrowing power.</p>
                <p><strong>Management</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>While  the main authority of SCBs is vested with the General Body, powers of  day-to-day functioning rests with the Board of Directors. As a share holder,  the government nominates some directors and the rests are selected by the  General Body.  The General Body meets  once in a year.</p>
                <p><strong>Sources  of Finance</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>The  sources of these banks are share capital, reserve funds, deposits from members  and non-members, borrowings from NABARD, SBI, State Government and direct state  contributions. The ceiling on borrowing varies from 12 to 20 times of the owned  funds.</p>
                <p><strong>Loaning  Policies</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>SCBs  provide short-term loans to meet expenses of agricultural operations, marketing  of agricultural produces and distribution of controlled commodities. They grant  medium term loans for the purchase of cattle, machineries, reclamation of land,  renovation of wells, tanks and channels, construction of farm sheds and  godowns, etc. Loans are granted to the member societies through their branches.</p>
                <p><strong>Land  Development Banks</strong><br />
                  The advent of new innovations in  agricultural technology, increasing demand for food with population explosion,  profitability in commercial agriculture, attractive price for exportable  agricultural commodities, etc., made the farmers to realize that agriculture  could also be taken up as an industry by effecting improvement on land for  increasing its production potential through more capital investment, which led  to the raising demand for long term credit. Farmers required larger amount to  acquire durable farm assets such as machineries and livestock and undertake  permanent land improvements, construction of wells, buildings, erection of pump  – sets, redemption of old debts, etc. Since the amount is large, it is  difficult for them to repay the loan amount in lump sum. The amount has to be  repaid in installments and distributed to a longer period of even 20 years.</p>
                <p><strong>Reasons  for the Establishment of LDBS </strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A  bulk of the credit was extended by non­-institutional agencies like money  lenders at higher rate of interest. Therefore, indebtedness of farmers was so  acute that it did not allow them to receive long-term credit.</li>
                  <li>The  organizational structure of the PACS and its lack of expertise in scrutinizing  or appraising the securities and long-term credit proposals did not permit them  to deploy long-term credit.</li>
                  <li>Commercial  banks could not dispense long­-term credit because of the short-term nature of  their deposits.</li>
                  <li>The  government was not considered as an ideal agency for extending long-term credit  as stated by the AIRCSC (1951).  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>            Hence, the need for special type of  credit institutions to meet the long-term credit demand for farmers had arisen.  The first Co-operative Land Mortgage Bank was set up at Jhang in Punjab in  1920. In 1924, the first land mortgage bank was registered in Bengal at  Naogaon. These banks however, could not achieve success due to mounting over  dues, malpractices, etc. The real beginning in land mortgage banking in India  was made when Central Land Mortgage Bank was set up in Madras in 1929.</p>
                <p>            During 1920-29, land mortgage banks  were established under the Co-operative Societies Act in Punjab, Mysore,  Bombay, Assam and Bengal. The Agricultural Finance Sub Committee (1945)  observed, &quot;Co-operative Land Mortgage Banks in India have so far been  advancing loans almost exclusively for the redemption of old debts. It should  not, however, be forgotten that the main object of land mortgage banking is to  finance land improvement.&quot; The AIRCSC (1954) recommended the establishment  of a Central Land Mortgage Bank (CLMB) in each state at the apex level and for  strengthening of the Primary Land Mortgage Banks (PLMB) at the district level.  During the third plan period, the LMBs received massive support from  institutional agencies like RBI, SBI, LIC and Agricultural Refinance Corporation.  The LMBs reoriented their loan policies towards providing loans for productive  purposes and attention was paid to agricultural development and hence, their  name was changed to &quot;Land Development Banks (LDBs)'. </p>
                <p><strong>Objectives </strong><br />
                  The main objective of the Land  Development Bank is to promote the development of agriculture and increase the  agricultural production. </p>
                <p><strong>Organizational  Structure </strong><br />
                  The long-term co-operative credit  structure is not uniform throughout the country. The structural pattern of LDBs  falls into one of the following four categories: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Federal  type with the Central Land Development Bank at the top and the Primary Land  Development Bank at the base. This pattern is adopted in Andhra Pradesh, Assam,  Haryana, Kerala, Karnataka, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.</li>
                  <li>The  Central Land Development Bank advances loans directly to farmers through  branches.</li>
                  <li>This  pattern prevails in Bihar, Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh.</li>
                  <li>The  CLDBs operating through branches as well as PLDBS.</li>
                  <li>The  CLDBs operates through separate departments of DCCBs of the area.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Area  of Operation</strong><br />
                  `The area of operation of PLDBs  shows very wide variation and it ranges from a taluk to a whole district. It  was estimated by the Working Group for Formulation of Fourth Five Year Plan  Proposals on Co-operation that a Primary Land Development Bank to be an  economically viable unit, should handle, a minimum business of Rs.20 lakhs a  year with a margin of 1.25 per cent, employing requisite staff for the purpose.</p>
                <p><strong>Membership</strong> <br />
                  In PLDBS, all land owners are  eligible to become members and borrow funds by mortgaging their land. The  principal borrower is enrolled as 'A' class members and others who have  interest in the mortgaged property are admitted as B class members. The members  of SLDBs are the PLDBs and a few industrial promoters.</p>
                <p><strong>Management</strong><br />
                  The management of the SLDB is vested in  a Board of Directors consisting of 7 to 9 members. The Government nominates 2  to 3 directors in some states. The State / Central LDB nominates the directors  in some states. </p>

                <p>The  State / Central LDB nominates one director of PLDB. The members of the Board  work for three years. The General Body is the ultimate authority in all matters  relating to administration of bank. In each SLDB, there is an in executive  committee, consisting of about 9 members of whom the President, Vice President,  the nominee of the Apex Co-operative Bank and the Registrar of Cooperative  Societies (RCS) are the ex-officio members. The rest are elected by the Board  of Directors from among them. The administration of the bank is vested with  directors in the executive committee. It has powers to admit members, sanction  loans, make investments, borrow funds and approve transfer of shares and  debentures. The management of PLDBs is vested in an elected Board of Directors  consisting of 9 to 12 directors.</p>
                <p><strong>Sources  of Finance</strong><br />
                  The PLDBs obtain  their finance from:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Share  Capital </li>
                  <li>Loans  from CLDBs / SLDBs</li>

                </ul>
                <p>The SLDBs get their  finance from:</p>
                
                  <ul>
                    <li>Share capital</li>
                    <li>Issue of debentures  (Debenture is a bond which conveys and acknowledges the receipt</li>
                    <li>of debt and also indicates  the payment of principal along with interest). </li>

                <p>            The PLDBs raise their share capital  by issuing shares to the members in certain proportion to their borrowings from  the bank. The ratio of share capital to the borrowed amount varies from 5 to 10  per cent (Maharastra). The CLDBs raise  their finance through issue of ordinary rural and special development  debenture.   A debenture is a long-term  loan issued by SLDBs, carrying fixed interest rate for a fixed period,  generally upto 20 years. The ordinary rural debentures are issued to the  general public institutions and individuals. These are treated as trustee  securities and are guaranteed by the state government. They are subscribed by  the RBI, SB1, co­operative banks, commercial banks and LIC. Rural debentures  are issued to raise funds for sanctioning loans to agriculturists for  productive purpose. Special debentures are floated for providing finance to the  agriculturists under special agricultural development or land development  programmes. </p>
                <p><strong>Lending  programme of LDBs</strong><br />
                  The CLDBs grant long-term loans to  agriculturists through PLDBs and branches of CLDBs. The CLDBs were advised to  ensure that at least to 90 per cent of the loans issued by them during 1982-83  were for increasing agricultural production, not less than 75 per cent being  devoted for easily identifiable productive purposes. SLDBs were further  required to ensure that at least 20 per cent of the loans granted under normal  lending programme were for the benefit of small farmers and weaker sections of  society. </p>
                <p>            The main function of CARDBs is to  grant loans on the security of agricultural properties. Primary Land  Development Bank gets applications, scrutinizes them and sends them to Central  Land Development Bank. The person of the Central Land Development Bank visits  the land of the applicant, determines its value and examines all other aspects  and finally sanctions the loan amount. In assessing the land value such factors  as the amount of land tax paid, the rental value of land, gross and net income  from land, sale value of land, etc., are taken into account. The applicant  obtains the loan amount from the PLDB. </p>
                <p>            Although  the   main  purpose  for   which  the Long Term  Cooperative  Credit Structure (LTCCS) was  established was land development (e.g., land leveling, minor irrigation, etc.),  it no longer forms a major purpose in the loan mix of  these institutions  and   loans  issued  for   such  purposes  form   an  insignificant component.  However, every time a loan is issued for plantation and horticulture  activities, about 20 per cent of the overall cost is primarily for land  development measures. Investments in minor irrigation also improve the overall  productivity of land and hence can be construed as land development. While  significant growth was witnessed in animal husbandry and farm mechanization  loans, there was a drastic fall in the proportion of loans for minor  irrigation. Even though new purposes like housing and fisheries did open up,  their magnitudes were negligible. </p>
                <p><strong>Rehabilitation  of SLDBs / PLDBs</strong></p>
                <p>            With a view to improve the  organizational and managerial efficiency of some weak SLDBs, several measures  were initiated. Based on the suggestions of the Standing Committee on Term  Lending through Co-operatives (COTELCOOP), the following measures  were initiated.</p>
                <p>i) In view of the emphasis on the viability of the primary units, the  SLDBs were advised to evaluate the performance of primary units every year in  September-October.<br />
                  ii) LDBs were advised to undertake a classification overdues / defaulters.<br />
                  iii) LDBs were asked to maintain beneficiary wise profile stating details  such as status of borrower, repayment and reasons for default.<br />
                  <br />
                  The most undesirable  feature of &quot;eligibility criteria&quot; is that  under this discipline, the new and potential borrowers of the credit agencies  are penalized due to mounting over dues of previous borrowers and the  deficiencies of the credit agencies. A recent study by RBI, i.e. Report of the  Agricultural Credit Review Committee had a review of the agricultural credit  system in India and it has suggested the replacement of eligibility criterion  by ‘viability criteria’ supported by institutional reinforcement’. Under this  scheme, all units of PLDBs which are solvent (owned funds are not wiped out by  their losses) will be eligible for unrestricted finance from NABARD which put  such institutions under the Programme of Institutional Reinforcement (IR) aimed  at making them viable. </p>
                <p>            The Long Term Co-operative Credit  Structure (LTCCS) was next reviewed by two other Committees, one chaired by  Shri K. Madhava Das (Committee on Cooperative Land Development Banks) in 1974  and the second by Dr. R. K. Hazari (Committee on Integration of Cooperative  Credit Institutions) in 1975. The Madhava Das committee, while endorsing diversification  of lending operations of the LDBs to cover a broader range of productive  activities in agriculture, emphasized the need for greater coordination with  the short term structure and the line departments of state governments. This  led to the renaming of the structure from LDBs to Agriculture and Rural  Development Banks (ARDBs). </p>
                <p>            The Committee suggested special  arrangements for providing LT credit in smaller states and states with  relatively less developed cooperative credit societies.  In   smaller states, it recommended   that instead of creating a separate   LT  structure, the  existing   ST  structure  be   encouraged  to  provide long   term  credit.  In states with poorly developed cooperatives  (especially Assam, J&amp; K, Tripura and West Bengal), it recommended  integration of the ST and LT structures. The Hazari Committee also examined the  viability of PCARDBs and suggested that a PCARDB should have a minimum loan  business of Rs.35 lakh to be viable. The Committee did not agree with the  recommendation of the AIRCRC that PACS should provide LT loans as agents of  PCARDB.  It felt that farming had become  complex and modern technological methods had led to demand for investment  credit for various purposes that the PACS would not be able to handle. </p>
                <p>            The   Committee  attributed  the   high  level  of   overdues in the LT structure, which   had grown  from  11 per cent   in 1969  to 45 per cent  in   1973,  to  defective loaning policies. It said the  overdues were an outcome of willful default, large-scale misuse of loans,  ineffective field supervision and lack of concerted efforts and will on the  part of banks’ board of directors and staff to recover loans. It also observed  that overdues were concentrated in loans extended to the bigger cultivators,  with land of more than 10 acres.  These  features persist even today. </p>
                <p>            The Hazari Committee (1975) noted  the increasing role of commercial banks in financing agriculture directly and  indirectly through PACS. It emphasized the need for increasing the role of  commercial banks and RRBs in financing agriculture, especially because of their  ability to provide both ST and LT credit. </p>
                <p><strong>Task  Force on Revival of Rural Cooperative Credit Institutions (Long Term)</strong></p>
                <p>            The Task Force which had submitted  its report on revival of the short term cooperative credit structure to the  Government of India (GoI) was asked in   January  2005 to also suggest an  implementable action plan for reviving the cooperative  agriculture and rural development banks and a  comprehensive strategy for  institutional  financing of long term investments for agricultural and rural  development.  </p>
                <p>            The ground level recovery  performance in the system is generally poor with five out of 10 states with the  federal structure showing recovery of less than 50 per cent at the primary  level while six out of 8 states with the unitary structure showed recovery of  less than 50 per cent. </p>
                <p>            The Task Force therefore recommends  that the approach for financial restructuring should ensure the functioning of  institutions as democratic, self governing and self reliant institutions by  appropriate amendments in the legal framework and governance and management of  LTCCS. </p>
                <p><strong>Recommendations</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                  The key  recommendations of the Task Force on institutional restructuring are as  follows:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>allow  PCARDBs to access all types of deposits from members </li>
                  <li>allow  PCARDBs to provide all types of loans to its members </li>
                  <li>allow  PCARDBs   to  borrow  from   any  regulated  financial   institution including federal units of the STCCS </li>
                  <li>all  state equity in the LT CCS maybe retired</li>
                  <li>convert  branches of unitary SCARDB into autonomous PCARDBs </li>
                  <li>allow  SCARDBs to mobilize public deposits under suitable regulatory and supervisory  arrangements </li>
                  <li>allow  PCARDBs to affiliate themselves with an upper tier of their choice</li>
                  <li>the  SCARDB   should  join  hands   with  the  SCB   in  its  state   and  set  up  a  support  service  unit   on  mutually  acceptable   terms  to  provide   such services to lower tiers in both the structures </li>
                  <li>CRAR  of minimum 7 per cent  be stipulated, to  be increased to 12 per cent  in 5 years</li>
                  <li>As no  unit under the LTCCS is a bank under the Banking Regulations (BR) Act, the use  of the word “bank” or its derivatives may be prohibited. </li>

                  LAMPS have been set up on the  recommendations of the study team (Committee on Cooperative Structure in Tribal  Areas) under the Chairmanship of Shri. Bawa appointed by the government of  India in 1971. These societies operate mainly in hill and tribal areas.</p>
                <p><strong>The objectives of LAMPS are:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>to provide all types of  credit, including those for meeting social obligations and consumer requisites  under single roof;</li>
                  <li>to provide technical  guidance in the intensification and modernization of agriculture;</li>
                  <li>to supply of inputs and  essential commodities; and</li>
                  <li>to arrange for the marketing  of agricultural and minor forest products besides the products of the  subsidiary occupations of the tribals.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Members</strong><br />
                  It is formed in a compact area of  having population of 10,000 approximately and the majority of whom should be tribals.  Membership restriction is there, i.e., 70 per cent of the members should be tribals  and 30 per cent of the members may be non-tribals.</p>
                <p><strong>Sources  o f Finance</strong><br />
                  Borrowings from commercial banks,  share capital, and government contributions are sources of finance to LAMPS.</p>
                <p><strong>Board of Management</strong><br />
                  The management is vested with managing  committee which is composed of three government nominated directors, nine  tribal and non tribal elected directors. </p>
                <p><strong>Performance</strong> <br />
                  LAMPS in tribal areas provide  concessional finance to tribals, which include short term, medium term and  consumption loan to carry on their agricultural operations, allied activities  and to meet other social purposes respectively at a concessional rate of 4 per  cent per annum (Gursharan Singh  Kainth, India’s Rural Cooperatives, books.google.co.in). </p>
                <p>            There were 2646 LAMPS as on 30 June  1991 with Madhya Pradesh (1073), Bihar (474), Maharashtra (290) and Orissa  (223) together accounting for 77.85 per cent of the total. Total members of  these societies were 39.31 lakh of which 29.86 lakhs were Scheduled Castes and  Scheduled Tribes. The paid up share capital stood at Rs. 30.70 crores and the  working capital was Rs. 453.55 crores. Over dues of LAMPS stood at Rs. 163.61  crores which formed 65.20 per cent of their demand. The non-credit business of  these societies restricted to marketing of products and distribution of farm  requisites and consumer goods.</p>
                <p>            The Committee to Review the  Arrangements for Institutional Credit for Agriculture and Rural Development  (CRAFICARD) observed constraints, which staggered the growth of LAMPS. They  are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Lack of aggressive  investment lending;</li>
                  <li>Non availability of trained  and experienced personnel for manning executive positions;</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>Unhealthy competition from  private traders;</li>
                  <li>Absence of effective  marketing organization and market intelligence, lack of infrastructural  arrangement for storage and transportation; and Inadequate agency commission to  the societies for distribution activities.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Farmers' Service Society (FSS)</strong><br />
                  By early 1970s, it was  found that the multi-purpose PACS had not succeeded much in diversifying their  operations, especially commodity marketing and processing, in reaching the  weaker sections and in becoming viable. They mostly under the control of the  better-off sections of the society and the small and marginal farmers were not  able to get access to the society or its services. The societies were not able  to provide a variety of services like funding infrastructural development such  as godowns and agro-service centre as well as providing finances for processing  industries in their localities other than credit, and supply of inputs. Hence,  based on the recommendation of National Commission on Agriculture, the scheme  of setting up FSS to cater to the credit and non-credit needs of farmers at a  single point was launched in 1973.</p>
                <p>            A  Group constituted by the Union Cabinet in July 1974 under the leadership of  T.A. Pai recommended the organization of FSS to meet the credit needs of rural  area. The study Team head by T.A.Pai recommended the setting up of 'Farmers  Service Co-operatives'. FSS has been evolved to change the power structure in  favour of weaker sections in rural areas and at the same time it will  strengthen the co-operative movement through adoption of commercial banking  principles in the management of its finances.</p>
                <p><strong>Objectives</strong><br />
                  The  main objective of FSS is to provide all types  of credit and full package of services and technical guidance to farmers  particularly small farmers, for enhancing production, and for diversification  of activities on the farm in an integrated manner and at one contact point.</p>
                <p><strong>FSS and PACS</strong><br />
                  Farmers'  Service Societies (FSS) would have the following features: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>FSS  unlike PACS will have a compact area of operations in 10-20 villages (instead  of 5-8</li>
                  <li>villages  for PACS) with a potential of reaching a business of Rs.2.5 to Rs.3 million  (instead of</li>
                  <li>Rs.0.2  million for PACS) in 3 to 5 years.</li>
                  <li>FSS  unlike PACS will have branches and such FSS may even reach a business of Rs.10  million</li>
                  <li>in 5  to 7 years.</li>
                  <li>FSS will  have an overall strategy of agro-based development to utilize land and  manpower. </li>
                  <li>FSS  membership will be more oriented to the hitherto neglected weaker sections of  the rural</li>
                  <li>population.</li>
                  <li>FSS  management will also be represented by this section.</li>
                  <li>FSS  will undertake both credit and non-credit (including agro-processing)  operations.</li>
                  <li>FSS  will be a self-paying proposition in the sense that it will meet all its costs  within </li>
                  <li>reasonable  period of time.</li>
                  <li>FSS  like PACS will be an integral part of a three - tiered cooperative credit  organization when</li>
                  <li>sponsored  by state cooperative banks.</li>
                  <li>FSS  will be a cooperative organization even when it is sponsored by the commercial  banks.</li>
                  <li>FSS  will have adequate and properly trained managerial and technical personnel.</li>
                  <li>FSS as  compared to PACS have the following three distinct features:</li>
                </ul>
                <p>(a) they are much larger  sized field level Rural Financial Institutions (RFIs),        <br />
                  (b) they have wider  scope of operations, and <br />
                  (c) their membership and  management are relatively more from the weaker sections. <br />
                  Some more specific  features of these two cooperatives are given in Table below.</p>

                <p><strong>Performance Criteria</strong><br />
                  From the  preceding discussion, it appears that four organizational principles have been  followed in promoting FSS. These are: (a) vertically integrated organizational  structure from local to regional to state / national level (also applicable to  PACS to some extent), (b) higher density of field-offices of FSS, (c) larger  coverage of clients with specific focus on the weaker sections, and (d)  multi-functional structure of operations which are horizontally integrated  (also applicable to PACS to some extent).</p>
                <p>            A study undertaken by RBI in 1980 on the working of FSS  revealed that:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A  number of PACS co-existed in the jurisdiction of FSS and resulted in overlap in  jurisdiction.</li>
                  <li>Large  cultivators continue to wield influence over FSS management.</li>
                  <li>The  nominees of state government and the sponsor banks did not show much interest  in the functioning of FSS.</li>
                  <li>Many  FSS were functioning without technical staff.</li>
                  <li>Many  of the FSS did not arrange for the marketing of farm produce.</li>
                  <li>They  performed limited non-credit functions related to supply of farm inputs and  distribution of consumer goods.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Performance</strong><br />
                  There  were 2410 FSS in India as on 30th June, 1991 with a total membership of 67.74  lakhs of which weaker section constituted 83.54 per cent. The paid-up share  capital was Rs.97.79 crores of which Rs.17.79 crores was contributed by the  State Government. The FSS issued loans to the tune of Rs.252.68 crores. The  overdue was 40.86 per cent of their demand. </p>
                <p><strong>National  Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC) </strong> <br />
                  The National Cooperative Development  Corporation (NCDC) was established by an Act of Parliament in 1963 as a  statutory Corporation under the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>
                <p><strong>Functions</strong><br />
                  Planning, promoting and financing  programmes for production, processing, marketing, storage, export and import of  agricultural produce, food stuffs, certain other notified commodities e.g.  fertilizers, insecticides, agricultural machinery, lac, soap, kerosene oil,  textile, rubber etc., supply of consumer goods and collection, processing,  marketing, storage and export of minor forest produce through cooperatives,  besides income generating stream of activities such as poultry, dairy, fishery,  sericulture, handloom etc. </p>
                <p>            NCDC Act has been further amended  which will broad base the area of operation of the Corporation to assist  different types of cooperatives and to expand its financial base. NCDC will now  be able to finance projects in the rural industrial cooperative sectors and for  certain notified services in rural areas like water conservation, irrigation  and micro irrigation, agri-insurance, agro-credit, rural sanitation, animal  health, etc. </p>
                <p>            Loans and grants are advanced to  State Governments for financing primary and secondary level cooperative  societies and direct to the national level and other societies having objects  extending beyond one State. Now, the Corporation can also go in for direct  funding of projects under its various schemes of assistance on fulfillment of  stipulated conditions. </p>
                <p><strong>National Cooperative Union of India (NCUI)</strong><br />
                    <strong>The Origin</strong><br />
                  The National Cooperative  Union of India (NCUI), the apex organization of the Indian Cooperative  Movement, can trace back its origin in 1929 when All India Provincial  Cooperative Institutes’ Association came into being with Shri Lallubhai Samal  Das Mehta as its first President. Having been reorganized as Indian Cooperative  Union, it was renamed later as All India Cooperative Union in 1954 and  re-christened as National Cooperative Union of India in 1961. </p>

                <p><strong>Achievements of Co-operative-Credit  Societies in India </strong><br />
                  The Co-operative credit  system has been in existence for the past 100 years. The best assessment of  co-operative movement was given by the All India Rural Credit Survey Committee,  1954 (i.e., exactly after 50 years of co-operative movements' existence) which  stated &quot;Co-operation has failed in India but it must succeed....&quot;.  But since 1954, the co-operative movement has made great progress. Some of its  achievements are listed below:</p>
                <p>i) The  co-operative credit societies satisfy the basic condition of proximity as they  can have intimate knowledge on the character and abilities of their members.  Further, the credit provided by co-operative societies is bound to be cheap due  to their low administrative costs.<br />
                  ii) In 1951,  the money lenders provided 69.7 per cent of the farmers' credit needs and it  declined to 29.6 per cent in 2002. Presently, the rural credit system is being  dominated by co-operatives as they increased their share from 3.1 percent in  1951 to 27.3 per cent in 2002. <br />
                  iii)  Co-operatives had led to the use of better farming methods, such as the use of  improved seeds, fertilizers, etc.<br />
                  iv) Credit  societies also provide non-credit services like storage, processing and  marketing of farm produces and supply of consumer goods.<br />
                  v)  Co-operatives have created a political awareness among rural people and made  them to participate in economic development in a democratic way.</p>
                <p><strong>Weaknesses of Co-operative Credit Societies</strong> <br />
                  There  are some important snags and deficiencies in the working of co-operative credit  societies and they have failed to acquire the dynamism needed to discharge  their responsibilities. The All India Rural Credit Survey committee and other  Committees on Co-operatives have brought out the following deficiencies in the  co-operative credit societies.</p>
                <p><strong>(i) Lack-of spontaneity</strong><br />
                    <strong>         </strong>The movement was not voluntary and the people did  not come forward to form societies to satisfy their economic needs. The  villagers generally thought that the societies were government-lending  institutions.</p>
                <p><strong>(ii) Lack of funds</strong><br />
                    <strong>         </strong>The basic feature of co-operative banking system  must be a large reliance on resources mobilized locally and a lesser  and lesser dependence on higher credit institutions. However, not only PACS but  also the higher credit institutions, viz., DCCBs and SCBs could not attract as much  deposits from the general public as was anticipated.</p>
                <p><strong>(iii) Loans for productive purpose only</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Co-operatives give loans only for agricultural  operations. However, farmers need credit for consumption purpose also. Hence,  they either depend on money lenders or they divert the production loans to meet  unproductive purposes which in turn lead to overdue problem.<strong></strong></p>
                <p><strong>(iv) Production credit only</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>The Co-operatives have failed to appreciate the  link between credit and processing and marketing. What is really needed is a  co-operative society which would integrate various aspects of agricultural  operations in order to meet all the needs of the farmers.</p>
                <p><strong>(v) Non-viable Units</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>A  viable unit is one which renders the more important services adequately to as many  members as possible within a reasonable time. According to NAFSCOB estimates, 62 per cent of the PACS  in the country are viable, 30 per cent are potentially viable and eight per  cent are either dormant, defunct or under liquidation during 2007-08.<strong> </strong></p>
                <p><strong>(vi) Uneven growth</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>The  development of co-operative movement indicated that the progress in different  parts of the country has been uneven. In 2007-08, Maharashtra ranked first in  terms of number of PACS (22.3 per cent of total number of PACS in India)  followed by Uttar Pradesh (9.4 per cent), West Bengal (8.5 per cent) and so on.  In terms of loan amount borrowed Maharashtra topped the list accounting for  19.1 per cent of the total loan amount disbursed by PACS and it was followed by  Andhra Pradesh (13.7 per cent), Haryana (8.4 per cent) and so on. Tamil Nadu  accounted for 4.8 per cent of number of PACS and 6.9 per cent of loan amount  borrowed in India during 2007-08.</p>
                <p><strong>(vii) Mounting Over dues</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>The financial soundness of co­operative credit  structure depends on the prompt recovery of loans. The problem of over dues  affects not only the interests of the defaulters themselves, but also the other  regularly ­repaying members, creditors, and the very co-operative movement  itself. The percentage of over dues to loan amount outstanding at the level of  PACS was 36.8 and it was 53.7 per cent at the level of PLDBs during 2007-08. At  the level of DCCBs, the percentage of over dues to demand was 28.7 in the same  year.</p>
                <p><strong>(viii) Defective management and leadership</strong><br />
                    <strong>              </strong>The failure or non-viability of co-operative credit  societies is also due to defective management and leadership. The officials do  not have proper training and hence they could not compete with money lenders or  private lending agencies.</p>
                <p><strong>(ix) Interference of the government</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>The Government attempts to convert co-operatives  into a government department with all its rigidities and short-sightedness  associated with a government department. Government also did not take adequate  interest in improving the financial strength of the societies. It also resorts  to ban or postponement of recovery of loans which hampers the functioning of  societies.</p>
                <p><strong>(x) Delayed credit</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>A common complaint is that farmers do not get loans  in time. So credit delayed is credit denied. Delayed credit tempts the borrower  to divert it to other unproductive purposes.</p>
                <p>(xi) Another problem faced by LDBs is the high cost of raising ordinary  debentures. As noted by ACRC, issue of ordinary debentures for non-schematic  lending for production purposes is at present a loss-making proposition as the  ordinary debentures carry higher rates of interest than the rates at which  loans are issued by them.</p>
                <p>(xii) Because of their strong socio-economic position, large farmers  have cornered greater benefits from co-operatives. For instance, farmers having  less than two hectares received only 32.8 per cent of the total loans advanced  by the PACS during 2007-08. </p>
                <p>xiii) The margins available at various levels in  the co-operative credit structure at present are inadequate as against the operational  costs. </p>
                <p><strong>Interest  Rates for </strong><strong>Refinance Schemes</strong></p>
                <p>            As the financial institutions are  refinanced at higher rates of interest by their higher level financial  institutions, their cost of management becomes higher and subsequently it  affects their profitability. The rates of interest charged by NABARD for its  refinance schemes are given below:</p>

                <p>            The Government of India has introduced an interest  subvention scheme whereby loans upto Rs. 3 lakhs are extended to farmers at an  interest rate of 7 per cent and Government of India provides a interest subsidy  of 2 per cent to the banks.</p>
                <p>            Hence, the financial  institutions, especially the co-operatives should be permitted to advance  priority sector loans at economic lending rates or the cost of debentures  floated by them has to be reduced by lowering the interest payable to  government and other lending institutions.</p>

                  <li>They  must have autonomy for granting advances and to recover loans. Co-opera­tives  should take serious actions against willful defaulters (those who </li>
                  <li>do  not repay loan- amount wantonly as per repayment schedule though they are able  to generate sufficient funds from the investment for which they got loan).</li>
