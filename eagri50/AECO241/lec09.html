				<p>In any business arrangement, both sides of the transaction must expect to  benefit. Crop insurance transactions are no different. This defines the first  boundary: crop insurance is sold and  bought in a market. The purchasers must perceive that the premiums and  expected benefits offer value; the sellers must see opportunity for a positive  actuarial outcome, over time, and profit. <br />
            Crop insurance is not the  universal solution to the risk and uncertainties which are part and parcel of  farming. Rather insurance can address part of the losses resulting from some  perils. The second boundary then is, insurance  has a limited role in risk management in farming. Again, the  implications of this will be explored below.<br />
            The third boundary is that any limitations  to the scope for effective and economic  crop insurance, though real at any given moment, can change over time. Farming enterprises and systems are dynamic.  They change over time, and in so doing present different patterns of risk and  new ways by which farming technology, and farm management techniques, can cope  with production and other risks. The design of insurance solutions is an  equally dynamic field of research and development. New techniques of  ascertaining that loss-causing perils have occurred, together with more  efficient and economical methods for measuring losses, mean that new types of  insurance products can be developed. When companies see a business opportunity  here, with an evident demand, then these products will be refined, funded and  marketed.<br />
            All  over the world agriculture is synonymous with risk and uncertainty. Agriculture  contributes to 24% of the GDP and any change has a multiplier effect on the  economy as a whole. Economic growth and agricultural growth are inextricably  linked to each other. Crop insurance helps in stabilization of farm production  and income of the farming community. It helps in optimal allocation of  resources in the production process.<br />
<strong>History  of Crop Insurance in India</strong><br />
            The Crop Insurance in India was  started with the introduction of the All-Risk Comprehensive Crop Insurance  Scheme (CCIS) that covered the major crops. This scheme was introduced in 1985.  In fact this period of introduction also coincided with the introduction of the  Seventh-Five-year plan. This initial scheme was of course later substituted and  replaced by the National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS). This  substitution came into effect from 1999. These Schemes that have been  introduced throughout the crop insurance history have been preceded by years of  preparation, studies, planning, experiments and trials on a pilot basis. In the  crop insurance history, the question of introducing a crop insurance scheme was  taken up for examination soon after the Indian independence. The first aspect that  was examined related to the modalities of crop insurance. The issue under  consideration was about whether the crop insurance should be offered under an  ‘individual approach’ or on ‘Homogenous area approach’.           <br />
            The Individual approach of the  scheme indemnifies the farmer to the full extent of the losses. Also the  premium that is to be paid by him is determined with reference to his own past  yield and loss experience. The Individual approach for these schemes  necessitates reliable and accurate data of crop yields of individual farmers  for a sufficiently long period, for fixation of premium on actuarially sound  basis. The Homogenous area approach on the other hand was aimed at envisaging a  homogeneous area from the point of view of crop production and similarity of  annual variability of crop production. The homogenous area approach was found  to be more favorable. This is because it would facilitate the provision of a  single unit treatment to various agro-climatically homogenous areas and the  individual farmers and allow them to pay the same rate of premium and receive  the same benefits, irrespective of their individual fortunes.  <br />
<strong></strong><strong>First  Individual Approach Scheme 1972-1978  </strong><br />
            Different  forms   of  experiments  on   agricultural  insurance  on   a  limited,  ad-hoc   and scattered scale started from 1972-73 when  the General   Insurance Corporation (GIC)   of  India  introduced  a   Crop  Insurance  Scheme   on  H-4  cotton. In the same year, general insurance  business was nationalized and, General Insurance Corporation of India was set  up by an Act of Parliament. The new corporation took over the experimental  scheme in respect of H-4 cotton.   This  scheme  was   based  on  “Individual   Approach”  and  later included  groundnut,   wheat  and  potato. The   scheme  was  implemented   in  the  states   of Andhra  Pradesh,  Gujarat,   Karnataka,  Maharashtra,  Tamil   Nadu  and  West   Bengal. It continued up to 1978-79 and covered only 3110 farmers for a  premium of Rs.4.54 lakhs against claims of Rs.37.88 lakhs. <br />
<strong>Pilot  Crop Insurance Scheme (PCIS) 1979-1984  </strong><br />
            In the background and experience of  the aforesaid experimental scheme, a study was commissioned by the General  Insurance Corporation of India and Prof. V.M.   Dandekar was entrusted to suggest a suitable approach to be followed in  the scheme. The recommendations  of  the   study were  accepted  and   a  Pilot Crop Insurance  Scheme was launched  by  the  GIC   in  1979,  which   was  based  on Area   Approach  for  providing insurance cover against  a decline   in  crop  yield below   the threshold  level. The  scheme covered  cereals, millets,  oilseeds,   cotton,  potato  and   chickpea  and  it   was  confined  to loanee   farmers  of  institutional   sources  on  a   voluntary  basis. The premium paid  was shared between the General Insurance Corporation of India and State  Governments in the ratio of 2:1. The maximum sum insured was 100 per cent of  the crop loan, which was later increased to 150 per cent. The Insurance premium  ranged from 5 to 10 per cent of the sum insured. Premium charges payable by  small/marginal farmers were subsidized by   50  per  cent   shared  equally  between   the  state  and   central  governments.  Pilot Crop Insurance Scheme–1979 was  implemented in 12 states till 1984-85 and covered 6.23 lakh farmers for a premium  of Rs.195.01 lakhs against claims of Rs.155.68 lakhs in the entire period.  <br />
<strong>Comprehensive  Crop Insurance Scheme (CCIS) 1985-99 </strong><br />
            This   scheme  was  linked   to  short  term   credit  and  implemented   based  on  the Homogenous area approach. Till Kharif 1999,  the scheme was adopted in 15 states and 2 UTs.    Both   PCIS   and CCIS were confined only to farmers who  borrowed seasonal agricultural   loan  from financial   institutions. The main  distinguishing feature of the two schemes was that PCIS was on voluntary basis  whereas CCIS was compulsory for loanee farmers in the participating states /  UTs. <br />
Main Features of the Scheme were </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>It covered  farmers availing crop  loans   from Financial  Institutions,  for growing food  crops   and  oilseeds,  on   compulsory  basis. The coverage  was restricted to 100 per cent of the crop loan subject to a maximum of  Rs.10,000/- per farmer. </li>
				  <li>The premium rates were 2 per  cent for cereals and millets and 1 per cent for pulses and oilseeds. Farmers’  share of premium was collected at the time of disbursement of loan. Half  of  the premium payable by small  and   marginal farmers  was  subsidized   equally by the Central  and State  Governments ( Tripathi, 1987)</li>
				  <li>Burden of Premium and Claims  was shared by Central and State Governments in a 2:1 ratio, and</li>
				  <li>The scheme was a multi  agency effort, involving GOI, State Governments, Banking Institutions and GIC. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Experimental  Crop Insurance Scheme (ECIS) 1997-98   </strong><br />
				  As demanded by various states from  time to time attempts were made to modify the existing CCIS. During  1997,   a  new  scheme,   namely  Experimental Crop  Insurance Scheme was  introduced   during  Rabi  1997-98   season with  the  intention   to  cover  even those   small  and marginal  farmers who   do  not  borrow   from  institutional  sources.   This scheme was implemented in 14 districts of five states. The Scheme  provided 100 per cent subsidy on premium.   The  premium  and   claims  were  shared   by  Central  and   State Governments  in 4:1  ratio. </p>
				<p><strong>National  Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) 1999 </strong><br />
				  The  National   Agricultural  Insurance  Scheme   (NAIS)  was  introduced   in  the country from the rabi  season of 1999-2000. Agricultural Insurance Company of India Ltd (AIC)  which   was  incorporated  in   December,  2002,  and   started  operating  from   April, 2003,  took over  the   implementation of NAIS. This scheme is available to both loanees and  non-loanees. It covers all food grains, oilseeds and annual horticultural /  commercial crops for which past yield data are available for an adequate number  of years. Among the annual   commercial  and  horticultural   crops,  sugarcane,  potato,   cotton,  ginger,  onion, turmeric,  chillies,   coriander,  cumin,  jute,   tapioca,  banana  and   pineapple,  are  covered under   the  scheme.  The   scheme  is  operating   on  the  basis   of  both area  approach,   for widespread  calamities,  and   individual  approach,  for   localized  calamities  such   as hailstorm, landslide, cyclone and floods.   <br />
				  Agriculture  insurance   in  India  till   recently concentrated only on crop sector and confined  to   compensate  yield  loss.   Recently some other insurance schemes have also come into operation in  the country which goes beyond yield loss and also cover the non- crop sector.  These include Farm Income Insurance Scheme, Rainfall Insurance Scheme and  Livestock Insurance Scheme. <br />
  <strong>Pilot  Scheme on Seed Crop Insurance (PSSCI) </strong><br />
				  The  Seed Crop Insurance Scheme was implemented on pilot basis during 1999-2000 and  2000-01 and the financial assistance was provided to the identified states  i.e., Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Gujrat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh,  Punjab, Rajasthan, U.P, Maharashtra for the implementation of the scheme. The  major objectives of this scheme are:<br />
  <strong>a)  Objectives </strong><strong> </strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>To provide financial  security and income stability to the seed growers in the event of failure of  seed crop</li>
				  <li>To build confidence in the  minds of existing seed growers and stimulate participation of new growers to  undertake seed production programme of newly released hybrid /     improved varieties</li>
				  <li>To provide stability to the  infrastructure established by the State owned Seed Corporations / State Farms  and</li>
				  <li>To give a boost to the  modern seed industry to bring it under scientific principles. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>b) States, Areas and Crops  to be covered: </strong><br />
				  Breeder', 'Foundation' and ‘Certified’  seeds of the following crops in the following States will be covered. The  identified States will opt for the crops to be covered from the list given in  Table 1. <br />

				<p>Only  the Foundation and Certified Seed produce that is offered to State Seed  Certification Agency (SSCA) for certification is eligible for coverage. In case  of Breeder Seed, the coverage is subject to the production being carried out  under the supervision of the concerned Monitoring Committee. For the purpose of  insurance coverage, seed areas under jurisdiction of a sub-office / area-office  of SSCA will be identified as a unit for determination of Average Yield and Sum  Insured in respect of that unit area.<br />
                    <strong>c)  Risks Covered</strong><strong> </strong><br />
				  The  proposed Scheme seeks to provide protection against those risks, which are  beyond control of the farmers. The following types of losses will be covered:<br />
  <strong>A.  At Field Stage</strong><br />
  <strong>A1.  Failure of Seed Crop Field either in Full or in Part due to the Perils  Indicated Below: </strong><strong> </strong></p>
				<p>Risks  of loss against natural fire, lightning, storm, hailstorm, cyclone, typhoon,  tempest, hurricane, tornado, flood, inundation, landslides, drought, dry  spells, excessive rain, large scale incidence of pests and diseases are  covered. Damages due to frost would also be covered under the Scheme. <br />
                    <strong>A2.  Loss in Expected Raw Seed Yield: </strong><br />
				  Following  perils in addition to the perils mentioned under Para A1 above will be covered: <br />
				  Prevalence  of excessive rain, blowing of hot and / or cold wind, excessive hot weather  during flowering or seed setting stage will be covered.<br />
  <strong>A3.  Loss of Seed Crop after Harvest</strong><strong> </strong><br />
				  Damage to the harvested seed crop  due to operation of the above-mentioned perils whilst lying on the field until  the crop is removed from the field for transportation to the processing plant  will be covered under the Scheme.<strong></strong><br />
  <strong>B.  At Seed Certification Stage</strong><strong> </strong><br />
				  Losses due to seed lots having  failed in 'Germination Test' due to operation of any of the insured perils  mentioned in Para A1 and A2 above will be compensated. Failure in germination  test due to any factor / reason other than the insured ones will not be  covered. <br />
  <strong>d)  Exclusions under Seed Crop Insurance</strong><strong> </strong><br />
				  Physical  damage / losses / rejection of field / seed on account of following reasons are  excluded from the coverage:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Poor crop stand due to  either defective planting material or unfavourable conditions prevailing during  sowing period. </li>
				  <li>Non-maintenance of prescribed  isolation distance. </li>
				  <li>Non-rouging at appropriate  times and non-conformity of prescribed standards or non-compliance of any of  the instructions of the Certification Agency. </li>
				  <li>When seed crop production  has not been taken up in ideal conditions with proper cultural practices. </li>
				  <li>Non-acceptance of crop due  to non-synchronization of male and female plants. </li>
				  <li>Lodging of seed crop and  resulting loss in yield except for the insured perils. </li>
				  <li>Loss or damage to seed crop  affected by pests and/or diseases, which otherwise, would have been controlled  by adopting adequate plant protection measures. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>viii)    Losses on account of Physical Purity, Genetic  Purity, and admixtures of Other Distinguishable Varieties (ODV) or due to  'other' reasons not covered under the Scheme. <br />
				  ix)      Loss of seed crop / seeds at  field stage / laboratory stage due to theft. <br />
				  x)      Losses  to seed crop whilst in transit. <br />
				  xi)      Loss / damage due to operation  of following perils directly or indirectly:</p>
				<ul>
				  <ul>
				    <li>War, invasion, civil war,  rebellion, conspiracy, persons acting maliciously. </li>
				    <li>Nuclear reaction, nuclear  radiation or radioactive contamination. </li>
			      </ul>
			    </ul>
				<p>xii)    Loss  or damage due to: </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Willful negligence of the  insured. </li>
				  <li>Human action, birds and  animals.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>e)  Sum Insured</strong><br />
				  Sum Insured is equivalent to  preceding three / five year's Average Seed Yield certified in respect of the  identified unit area multiplied by 'Procurement Price' of the seed crop variety  prevailing in the previous season by National Seed Corporation (NSC). The Sum  Insured may be increased up to 150 per cent of the average processed, tagged  certified Seed Yield. A producing agency opting for higher Sum Insured would be  required to pay a correspondingly higher premium.<br />
  <strong>f)  Salvage</strong><br />
				  All seed  crops identified for coverage under the Scheme have salvage values. Salvage  values will be calculated at a fixed percentage of Procurement Price (PP) as  given below, which will be deducted from the claim amount before payment.  Alternatively, the insurer will pay the full amount of compensation (i.e.,  before deduction of salvage) and will take over the possession of the salvage.  The deduction of salvage will be applicable in case of losses in Germination  test only.<br />

				<p><strong>g)  Loss Assessment Method</strong><br />
				  The certification agency officials,  who periodically inspect the field, will intimate individual grower-wise, the  details of damages / losses and rejection thereof to the seed producing  organization and to the insurer. The insurer will arrange for surveying the  loss and the compensation will be estimated and paid as per graded scale mentioned  earlier. The first inspection of the seed crop will be done by the State Seed  Certification Agencies within 45 days in case loss is reported by the seed  grower, otherwise if the crop is normal, the State Seed Certification Agencies  will work out the inspections as per their routine norms. The amount of claim  will be proportionate to the area rejected. <br />
  <strong>Excess:</strong> 20 per cent of all admissible claims will be borne by the Insured. <br />
				  Loss after Harvesting and until the Crop is ready  for Transportation<br />
				  Concerned  seed producing organization / grower will intimate the loss soon after the  incident of loss to the insurer giving all the detailed information. The  Insurer will arrange or survey / loss assessment and the compensation will be  estimated and paid.<br />
  <strong>Excess:</strong> 20 per cent of all admissible claims will be borne  by the Insured.<br />
				  Loss at Seed Certification Stage<br />
				  Certification Agency and seed producing organization  both will intimate <br />
  <strong>i) Sharing of Risk</strong><br />
				  Premium will go to the account of the Insurer, i.e.,  General Insurance Corporation of India. The Claims beyond 200 per cent of  premium income will be to the insurer the individual farmer-wise Actual  Quantity Rejected due to failure in germination test on account of natural  calamity along with the laboratory test results. The maximum amount of claim  will be the procurement value of the rejected quantity less salvage value as  referred in Salvage value chart.</p>
				<p><strong>h) Premium Rate</strong><br />
            Crop-wise  premium at the following rates will be charged borne by the Government on a  sunset basis - in the first year 100 per cent, in the second year 50 per cent  and in the third year 25 per cent of losses beyond 200 per cent of the premium  income might be met by the Central  Government. From the fourth year onwards the General Insurance Corporation of  India will meet the losses fully. <br />

				<p><strong>i)  Reinsurance</strong></p>
				<p>General  Insurance Corporation of India will negotiate suitable reinsurance arrangement  in the international market to cover the losses exceeding 100 per cent of  premium income. In case the reinsurance arrangement also covers the Government  of India's liability, the same will be adjusted while receiving the Government  of India's share of claims liability.<br />
                    <strong>2.7  Farm Income Insurance </strong><br />
				  The Farm Income Insurance Scheme was  started on a pilot basis during 2003-04 to provide income protection to the  farmers by integrating the mechanism of insuring yield as well as market risks.  In this scheme the farmers’ income is ensured by providing minimum guaranteed  income. <br />
  <strong>2.8  Livestock Insurance  </strong><br />
				  Livestock insurance is provided by  public sector insurance companies   and  the insurance  cover   is  available  for   almost  all  livestock   species. Normally, an animal is insured up to 100 per cent of the market  value. The premium is 4 per cent of the sum insured for general public and 2.25  per cent for Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP) beneficiaries. The  government subsidizes premium for IRDP beneficiaries. Progress in livestock  insurance, however, has been slow and poor.  <br />
  <strong>2.9  Weather Based Crop Insurance / Rainfall Insurance                    </strong><br />
				  During  the   year  2003-04  the   private  sector  came   out  with  some   insurance products in agriculture based on weather parameters. The  insurance losses due to vagaries of weather, i.e.  excess or   deficit rainfall,  aberrations  in sunshine,   temperature  and humidity,  etc.  could  be   covered  on  the   basis  of weather  index.   If  the  actual   index  of  a specific   weather  event  is   less  than  the   threshold,  the  claim   becomes  payable  as  a  percentage of deviation of actual index. One such product, namely Rainfall  Insurance was developed by ICICI-Lombard General Insurance Company. This move  was followed by IFFCO-Tokio General Insurance Company and by public sector  Agricultural Insurance Company of India (AIC). Under the scheme, coverage for  deviation in the rainfall index is   extended  and  compensations   for  economic  losses   due  to  less   or more  than  normal rainfall are paid.   <br />
				  ICICI Lombard, World Bank and the  Social Initiatives Group (SIG) of ICICI Bank collaborated in the design and  pilot testing of India’s first index based weather insurance product in  2003-04. The pilot test covered 200 groundnut and castor farmers in the  rain-fed district of Mahaboobnagar, Andhra Pradesh. The policy was linked to  crop loans given to the farmers by BASIX Group, a NGO, and sold through its  Krishna Bhima Samruddhi Area Bank. The weather insurance has also been  experimented with 50 soya farmers in Madhya Pradesh through Pradan, an NGO, 600  acres of paddy crop in Aligarh through ICICI Banks agribusiness group along  with the crop loans, and on oranges in Jhalawar district of Rajasthan.   <br />
				  Similarly, IFFCO-Tokio General  Insurance (ITGI) also piloted rainfall insurance under the name - Baarish Bima  during 2004-05 in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat. Agricultural Insurance  Company of India (AIC) introduced rainfall insurance (Varsha Bima) during 2004  South-West Monsoon period. Varsha Bima provided for five different options  suiting varied requirements of farming community.  These   are  (1) seasonal  rainfall   insurance  based  on   aggregate  rainfall  from   June  to  September,   (2) sowing failure insurance based on rainfall between 15th June and  15th August, (3) rainfall distribution   insurance with  the weight  assigned   to   different weeks  between   June  and September,  (4)   agronomic  index  constructed   based  on  water   requirement  of  crops   at different  pheno-phases  and   (5)  catastrophic  option,   covering  extremely  adverse deviations  of   50  per  cent   and  above  in   rainfall  during  the   season.  Varsha  Bima   was piloted  in  20   rain  gauge  areas   spread  over Andhra  Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan  and Uttar Pradesh in 2004-05. <br />
				  Based on the experience of the pilot  project, the scheme was fine-tuned and implemented  as   “Varsha Bima -2005” in about 130 districts across Andhra Pradesh,  Chattisgarh, Gujarat,  Karnataka,  Mahrashtra, Madhya  Pradesh,  Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand  and   Uttar  Pradesh  during   Kharif  2005. On an average, 2 or  3 blocks /mandals / tehsils were covered under each India Meteorological  Department (IMD) rain gauge stations. The   scheme  covered  the   major  crops  provided   at  least  two   coverage  options namely, Seasonal  Rainfall  Insurance or Rainfall  Distribution  Index and Sowing Failure  Insurance. Varsha Bima-2005 covered 1.25 lakh farmers with a premium income of  Rs.3.17 crore against a sum insured of Rs.55.86 crore. Claims amounting to  Rs.19.96 lakh were paid for the season. Further, during kharif 2006, the scheme  was implemented as Varsha Bima-2006 in and around 150 districts/ rain gauge  station areas covering 16 states across the country.  </p>
