				<p><strong>Definition</strong><br />
				  Credit is obtaining control over the  use of money at the present time in exchange for a promise to repay it at some  future time.<br />
				  Credit is also defined as a device  for facilitating the temporary transfer of purchasing power from those who have  surpluses of it to those who are in need of it. Thus, credit involves a  temporary transfer of wealth.<br />
				  Agricultural Credit is the amount of  investment funds made available for agricultural production from resources  outside the farm sector.<br />
				  Agricultural Finance is considered  as separate field of study dealing with lending and borrowing by organizations  and farmers.<br />
				  Hopkin et al referred agricultural  finance as the means of acquiring and control of assets, ownership by cash  purchase or borrowing or leasing or custom-hiring.<br />
				  Warren F.Lee et al defined  Agricultural Finance as the economic study of the acquisition and use of  capital in agriculture. It deals with the supply of and demand for funds in the  agricul­tural sector of an economy. <br />
				  According to William G. Murray,  agricultural finance is the economic study of borrowing of funds by farmers; of  the organization and operation of farm lending agencies; and of  society's interest in credit for agriculture. <br />
				  Farm Finance is a branch of  agricultural economics which deals with the provision and management of  services of financial resources related to the individual farm units.<br />
				  Farm finance  can also be defined as the amount of funds  obtained from off-farm sources for use on the farm, repayable in future with an  interest agreed to either explicitly or implicitly.<br />
				  <strong>Farm Finance</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>is not meant merely for  more  production but also to raise the  productivity of farm resources;</li>
				  <li>not a mere loan or advance ,  but it is an instru­ment to promote the well being of the farming community;</li>
				  <li>is not just a science to  manage the money, but is an applied   science of allocating scarce resources to derive optimum output; and</li>
				  <li>not a mere social obligation  on the society; but it is a lever with backward and forward linkages to the  economic development both at toe micro and macro level.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>At macro level, farm  finance may be defined as the study of impact of finance (extended to the  farmers by the intermediaries) on agricultural sector and also on the economy  as a whole. At micro level, farm finance may be defined as the study of these  intermediaries who extend finance to the farming sector and obtain their  loanable funds from financial markets. <br />
				  Thus, farm finance should have the  following features:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>finance should be extended  to farmers for farm activities;</li>
				  <li>finance should stimulate tie  productivities of farm resources resulting in higher economic returns for the  investment;</li>
				  <li>finance should promote  economic development of farm households; and</li>
				  <li>finance should be provided  by an external agency for strengthening the backward and forward linkages with  country's economic development.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>             Further, farmers and bankers view farm finance  in different ways as detailed below:</p>

				<p><strong>Classification  of Agricultural credit</strong><br />
				  Agricultural credit can be  classifified based on purpose, time (repayment period), security, generation of  surplus funds, creditor and number of activities for which credit is provided.<br />
  <strong>i)  Purpose: </strong>Based on the purpose for which loan is  granted, agricultural credit is categorized into:<br />
  <strong>a)  Development credit or Investment Credit:</strong> This is provided for  acquiring durable assets or for improving the existing assets. Under this,  credit is extended for:<br />
				  - purchase of land and  land reclamation.<br />
				  - purchase of farm  machineries and implements <br />
				  - development of  irrigation facilities<br />
				  -  construction of farm structures<br />
				  - development of  plantation and orchards<br />
				  - develonment of dairy,  poultry, sheep/goat, fisheries, sericulture, etc.<br />
  <strong>b)  Production credit:</strong><strong> is given for crop, production:</strong> Here, the loan  amount is used for purchasing inputs and for paying wages. <br />
  <strong>c)  Marketing credit:</strong> It  is essential to carry out the marketing functions and to get higher prices for  the produce. <br />
  <strong>d)  Consumption credit</strong><strong>:</strong> It is the credit required by the farmer to meet his family expenses.<br />
  <strong>ii)  Repayment Period: </strong>Based on the period for  which the borrower require credit, it is divided into:<br />
  <strong>a)  Short-Term Credit:</strong> It is given to farmers for  periods ranging from 6 to 18 months and is primarily meant to meet cultivation  expenses viz., purchase of seed, fertilizer, pesticides and payment of wages to  labourers. It serves as the working capital to operate the farm efficiently and  is expected to be repaid at the time of harvesting / marketing of crops. It.  should be repaid in one instalment.<br />
  <strong>b)  Medium-Term Credit:</strong> Repayment  is for the period of 2 to 5 years, It is for the purchase of pump-sets, farm  machineries and implements, bullocks, dairy animals and to carry out minor  improvement in the farm. It can be repaid either in half­ yearly or annual  installments.<br />
  <strong>c) Long-Term Credit:</strong> It is advanced for periods more than 5 years and extends even unto twenty five  years against mortagage of immovable property for undertaking development works  viz., sinking wells, purchase of tractor, and rnaking permanent improverments  in the farm. It has to be repaid in half-yearly or annual instalments.<br />
  <strong>iii)  Secutirty: </strong>Credit is provided to farmers based on  the security offered by them.</p>
				<ol>
				  <li><strong>Farm Mortgage Credit:</strong> It is secured against mortgage of land.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>b)  Collateral Credit or Chattel Credit:</strong> It is given against the  security of livestock, crop or warehouse receipt.<br />
                    <strong>c)  Personal Credit:</strong> It is given based on the character and  repaying capacity of the person and not on any tangible assets. In general, LT  credit is usually advanced against security of land while MT and ST loans are  sanctioned against personal and. collateral security.<br />
                    <strong>iv) Generation  of Surplus Funds: </strong>Based on generation of  surplus funds, credit can be classified as self-liquidating and non-self  -liquidating credit.<br />
                    <strong>a)  Self Liquidating Credit:</strong> In this case, loan amount  gets absorbed in the production process-in one year or production period and  the additional income generated is sufficient to repay the entire loan amount.</p>
				<p><strong>b)  Non-Self Liquidating Credit:</strong><strong> </strong>Here the resources acquired with the borrowed  funds are not consumed in the production process during the project period. The  investment is spread over a period of several years. The additional income  generated in one year is not sufficient to repay the entire loan amount and  hence the repayment is spread over to number of years.<br />
                    <strong>v)  Creditor or Lender wise Credit: </strong>Credit can be  classified from the point of view of creditor.<br />
				  a<strong>) Non - Institutional Agencies:</strong> They include money lenders, traders, commission agents, friends and relatives.  This kind of loan is generally exploitative.<br />
  <strong>b)  Institutional Agencies:</strong> They include  co-operative’s, commercial bank and regional rural bank.<br />
  <strong>vi)  Number of Activities Served:</strong> Based on the number of  activities for which amount the loan can be used, credit can be categorized  into a) single purpose loan and b) composite loan.</p>
