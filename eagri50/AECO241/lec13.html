				<p><strong>Co-operative credit System in Maharashtra</strong><br />
            Maharashtra  has all along been a leader in cooperative movement. Cooperative has become a  way of life for people in the State. Almost 50% of the State’s population is  connected to 1.78 lakh cooperative societies, covering different aspects of  people’s day to day life. We have about 20,000 primary agriculture credit  cooperative societies and 31 district central cooperative banks. As against six  villages covered by the society in the country, we in Maharashtra have one  society for two villages. More than 10 million farmers are members of the  primary societies. The cooperative credit system in the State accounts for 65%  of the credit disbursements for agriculture as compared to 35% at national  level. That is why, the State needs to ensure that the cooperative credit  institutions remain vibrant and work in a professional and competitive  environment.</p>
				<p>            The  cooperative credit institutions in districts, having good access to irrigation  have done extremely well due to greater degree of crop diversification. The  dams and the societies in consistently drought prone and rain-fed districts,  have not been able to stand the impact of continued default and thus, over a  period of time, become extremely weak. Revitilisation of these institutions is  a must to ensure greater flow of capital to agriculture in these districts.</p>
				<p>            The  cooperative movement has contributed a great deal in the development of rural  economy in the State. While we lead the country in terms of financial  institutes in the cooperative sector, there are many other success stories like  sugar industry, textiles, poultry, milk, agro-processing and marketing etc.  What else can be the best way to show it, than to stand up to the challenge of  competition?</p>
				<p>            Over  the time, there has been some slackness in the working of some of these  societies, but I must say that these societies have contributed immensely in  the growth of rural areas in the State. The slackness in the working of many of  these societies can be attributed to many factors, but lack of appropriate  incentive system is one of the key reasons for it. The recommendations of Task  Force will help in creating environment for such incentive system to operate.  The cooperative credit structure in Maharashtra will grow at much faster rate  once faced with competitive forces and will help serve our population better.</p>
				<p>            The  suggestions made by the Task Force relating to financial, administrative, legal  and technical aspects seem to be well through out. When we talk of competition,  the independence of the concerned institution also needs to be re-visited and  they are required to be given environment for operating freely and in  democratic manner, as demanded by the competitive atmosphere. Recommendation to  provide wider choice on borrowings and investing to cooperatives and in turn to  borrowers is going to galvanise the rural credit system. Small borrowers will  now operate in buyers’ market, thus providing them with more bargaining power. </p>
				<p><strong>Agricultural  Credit </strong><strong> </strong><br />
				  The  co-operative agricultural credit structure in Maharashtra is a three tier  structure. </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Short &amp; Medium Term Credit Long Term Credit  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
				  <li>Central Co-op Banks at district level&nbsp; </li>
				  <li>Primary Agricultural Credit Societies at Village  Level </li>
				  <li>Long term credit Mascard Bank </li>
				  <li>Branches at district level </li>
				  <li>Sub Branches at Taluka level&nbsp; </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>(MASCARD Bank is Maharashtra State  Co-operative Agriculture and Rural Development Bank )<br />
				  Thus the agricultural credit reached  the farmers right upto their doorstep through the Primary Agricultural Credit  Societies (PACS). The Short Term loan is made available for a period of 12 to  15 months for meeting the cost of expenditure during the agricultural season. Medium  Term loan is given for a period of upto five years for the purchase of  bullocks, carts, repairs to old wells etc..The Long Term Loans are granted for  period exceeding five years mainly for sinking of wells, permanent fencing,  purchase of land, purchase of heavy agricultural machinery like tractors etc as  well as for lift irrigation schemes.<br />
				  The life of the farmer is full of  problems- small holdings, indebtedness, lack of irrigation facilities leading  to low productivity. He is traditionally used to dealing with one single agency  for satisfaction of all his credit requirements. Thus the local trader/money  lender not only lends him money for his seeds, fertilisers, insecticides etc.  but at times also provides these necessities to him. The trader/moneylender  also provides him credit for his household needs. And when the crops are  harvested the trader also markets the crops.<br />
				  In their initial days  the rural credit societies could not satisfy the needs of the farmers. They did  not have enough funds or facilities to offer to the farmers. Thus the farmers  continued to rely on the money lenders and suffer.  Thus came the advent of multipurpose co-operatives. However since  the societies at the village level were small in size, they could not provide  adequate services to their members. The Government therefore gave financial  assistance to these societies and thus increased their borrowing capacity. Crop  Loan System has also been introduced. The government has introduced various  schemes to improve the economic conditions at the rural level </p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Subsidy to Agricultural       Credit Stabilisation fund </li>
				  <li>Contribution to Risk       Fund </li>
				  <li>Share Capital       Contribution </li>
				  <li>Loans to Co-operative       Credit Societies for the conversion of Loans from Short Term to Medium       Term. </li>
				  <li>Crop Production       Incentive to agriculturists. </li>
			    </ol>
				<p>&nbsp;<strong>District  Central Co-operative Banks</strong><br />
				  There are 30 such Banks in  Maharashtra whose primary object is to provide for the credit requirements of  the Primary Credit societies. The first such secondary level co-operative was  registered in Mumbai in 1911 under the Government of India Act, 1904. Since  then these Central Banks have laid the firm financial infrastructure for the  co-operative movement in Maharashtra.<br />
				  The progress of the  District Central Co-operative Banks can be seen from the following figures :<br />

				<p><strong>The  Primary Agricultural Credit/Service Societies </strong><br />
                    <strong><br />
                    </strong>            The  agricultural co-operative credit structure in the Punjab State is broadly  divided into two sectors, one dealing with the short-terms and&nbsp;  medium-terms finance and the other with the long-term credit. In the State, the  short-term and medium-term credit structure&nbsp;is based on a three-tier  system, i.e., the Apex Co-operative Bank at the State level, the Central  Co-Coperative Bank at the district/tehsil level and the Primary Agricultural  Credit Societies at the village level. The major objectives of the primary  agricultural credit service societies are to supply agricultural credit to meet  the requirements of funds for agricultural production, the distribution of  essential consumer commodities, the provision of storage and&nbsp; marketing  facilities&nbsp; and for light agricultural implements and machinery.<br />
                    <br />
				  Owing to an increasing emphasis  on the development of land and agriculture, long-term co-operative credit has  assumed great importance. There is the Punjab State Land Mortgage Bank at the  Apex and the Punjab Mortgage Bank at the district/tehsil level. These Primary  Land Mortgage Banks advance loans to the farmers for long term purposes.<br />
  <br />
				  At the operational level,  there exists a primary co-operative to extend credit to the farmer. This unit  epitomizes the vitality and service potential of the Co-operative Movement in  India. The organization of these societies dates back to 1904, when the first  Co-operative Societies Act was passed. These societies were started with the  object of providing cheap credit to the agriculturists in order to free them  from the clutches of the rapacious money-lenders. the agricultural primary  credit society is the foundation-stone on which the whole co-operative edifice  is built. Even now these societies dominate the co-operative picture.<br />
  <br />
				  The first Agricultural Credit  Society in the Firozpur District was registered on 4 October 1911, at the  Village of Khalchi Kadim in the Firozpur Tehsil. Originally, the movement was  confined to the credit societies only and, thus, credit dominated till the  partition (1947). After the partition, the Co-operative Movement began to  spread to other field, viz labour, construction and farming.</p>
