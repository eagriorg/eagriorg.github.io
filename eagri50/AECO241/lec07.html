				<p>The need for evolving a hybrid type of credit agency which combines the  resource orientation of the  commercial banks and the rural orientation of the co-operatives has been expressed in the reports of a few of the committees which have looked  into rural credit problems.<br />
            To  review the flow of institutional  credit especially to the weaker  sections of the rural  community, the Government of India appointed a Working Group in 1975 under the chairmanship of<strong> </strong>Narasimhan. The Group identified certain deficiencies in the  functioning of co-operatives and commercial banks and recommen­ded the setting  up of state-sponsored, regionally based and rural oriented banks called  Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) which would encompass local feel and familiarity with  several problems which the co-operatives possess and the degree of business  organization, ability to mobilize the deposits, access to central money markets  and a modernized outlook which the commercial banks have. The Government of  India accepted this recommendation and RRBs were established in <br />
1976.<br />
            The main objective of RRB is to  provide finance to small and marginal farmers, agricultural labourers, artisans  and small entrepreneurs whose annual income is less than Rs.10,000.<br />
<strong>Features</strong><br />
            The idea behind the establishment of  RRBs is to develop a comparatively backward area where the commercial bank and  co-operative is relatively poor. The main difference from the commercial bank  is that the area of operation of RRB is confined to a region comprising one or  two contiguous districts. One of the tasks envisaged for the RRBs is to  maintain their cost of operations at a lower level than that of the commercial  banks. So the salary structures of the staff were comparable to that of the  State government employees.<br />
            RRBs are sponsored by schedule  commercial banks. A few non-public sector commercial banks and state  co-operative Banks are also allowed to sponsor RRBs. The sponsoring bank  provides managerial assistance to RRBs for the first five years.  The management of RRB is through a nine  member Board of Directors <a href="http://headed.by">headed by</a> a chairman who  is an officer of the sponsor bank. The Board consists of three nominees of  Government of India, two nominees of the concerned State government, four  including the chairman by the sponsor commercial bank.</p>
				<p>The  authorized share capital of a RRB has been fixed at Rs.5 crore and issued  capital is Rs. one crore. Of this, 50 per cent is subscribed by the central  government, 15 per cent by the concerned state government and 35 per cent by  the sponsor bank.<br />
                    <strong>Progress  of RRBs in India</strong></p>

				<p>            Source: Report on Trend and progress  of Banking in India, 1990-91 and 2008-09. <br />
                    <strong>Performance</strong></p>
				<p>            As scheduled banks, they mobilize  deposits and they have been allowed to offer slightly higher rate of interest,  i.e., 0.5 per cent per annum, on their deposits upto five years. RRBs have been <a href="http://advised.to">advised to</a> render other banking services like  collection of cheques and bills, issue of drafts, collection of'-insurance  premia, safe custody etc. About 60 per cent of the total advances made by RRBs  were claimed by agriculture and allied activities.</p>
				<p>      The Committee set up by the RBI in 1977  under the chair­manship of M.L.Dantwala to review the working of the RRBs  recommended that RRBs should be extended to such areas where DCCBs are not able  to adequately serve the PACS under their jurisdiction. The CRAFICARD (1981)  recommended that the RBI may transfer the business of commercial banks rural  branches to RRBS when such proposals are presented.</p>
				<p>            The Kalyanasundaram committee (1986)  was appointed to study the wage structure and service conditions of the RRB  staff.</p>
				<p>            The Agricultural credit Review  committee (ACRC) headed by Prof. Khusro in 1989 recommended that the RRBs and  their branches can be merged with their sponsor banks due to the following  reasons:<br />
				  a) The  performance of commercial banks in rural lending in terms of branch expansion  and recruiting technically qualified staff for rural branches is better than RRBs.<br />
				  b) The  accumulated loss and over dues of RRB were very heavy.<br />
				  However, the Government of India has  decided not to merge the RRBs with sponsor banks.Instead, the government has  decided to implement the recommendations of the Kelkar committee (1986) in- a  bid to revive these banks. </p>
				<p>The steps proposed for  strengthening the RRBs include:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Enhancing  their authorized capital from Rs.1 crore to Rs.5<strong> </strong>crores and the  issue (paid-up share capital from Rs.25 lakhs to 1 crore)</li>
				  <li>Reducing  the interest rates from 8.5 per cent to 7 per cent on the refinance loans  provided by the sponsor banks, and</li>
				  <li>Channelising  their surplus funds into more profitable investments, such as the government securities.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Problems</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>   There  is a lack of managerial efficiency due to larger area of operation. Some RRB cover 10-15 lakh population</li>
				  <li>    Lack  of uniform guidelines for recruitment and promotion.</li>
				  <li>The number of loss making banks in 1976 was 23 and it rose to 149 in 1988  but declined to  </li>
			    </ol>
				<p>      6 in 2009. The accumulated loss  of RRB was Rs.550 crores (1991) which was more than       <br />
				  their entire paid up capital  and reserves. However, the loss declined to Rs.36 crorein 2008-  <br />
				  09.</p>

				<p><strong>Factors influencing  the performance of RRBs</strong><br />
				  Since their inception, the financial health of RRBs has  been indifferent. A host of factors, both internal and external, has had a  bearing on the performance of RRBs. Some of the major factors that had a  bearing on the performance of RRBs are as follows:<br />
  <strong>i)</strong> <strong>Area  of operation: </strong>The RRBs are constrained in their operations by their limited  area of operation. This coupled with their narrow base of business activities  and the low clientele base, has resulted in high risk exposure of RRBs.<br />
  <strong>ii)</strong> <strong>Clientele  base: </strong>The customers of RRBs comprise small and marginal farmers, small  scale sector, small transport operators, SHGs, etc., whose credit requirements  are mostly small. RRBs are unable to cross-subsidize their lending business as  they do not generally provide credit to wealthy borrowers with large needs,  thereby affecting their capacity to earn higher incomes.<br />
  <strong>iii)</strong> <strong>Capital  base: </strong>RRBs as a group have a low capital base, and their authorized capital  of Rs.1 crore places serious limitations on their business size. Furthermore,  in the case of some of the RRBs their deposit liabilities are very large  compared to their capital base. For instance, as as on March 31, 2004 while 2  RRBs had deposit liabilities of over Rs 1,000 crore, 24 RRBs had a deposit base  ranging between Rs.500 to Rs.1,000 crore, and 146 RRBs had deposit liabilities  between Rs.100 to Rs.500 crore. In view of their low capital base, in the event  of inefficient use/misuse of funds resulting in a financial problem, the  stakeholders would have to bail out the bank.<br />
  <strong>iv)</strong> <strong>Organizational  structure: </strong>The size of financial assets, as well as linkages which are  necessary for effective banking services has been limited by the small  organizational structure of RRBs. This has also come in the way of growth in  business volumes and garnering a larger share of the rural financial market.</p>
				<p><strong>v)</strong> <strong>Loan  delinquencies: </strong>RRBs loan recovery rates have declined over the years,  resulting in a large over hang of NPAs (around Rs.3,200 crore) which has come  in their way of recycling funds and increasing the flow of credit to the rural  sector. The directed lending policy for RRBs has resulted in low quality of  assets. This coupled with high cost of funds and below cost interest rates on  loans has led to high accumulated losses and piling up of bad assets in the  case of many RRBs.<br />
                    <strong>vi)</strong> <strong>Cost  structure: </strong>RRBs are characterized by high cost of servicing numerous small  accounts and high wage cost. Furthermore, RRBs get credit from sponsor banks  and refinance from NABARD at rates of interest higher than the market rates.  This places limitations on their ability to reduce the rates they charge to  their ultimate borrowers, although they are compelled to do so on account of  competition from banks.<br />
                    <strong>vii)</strong> <strong>Perceived  as specialized bank: </strong>There has been an uneven growth of RRBs due to the  diffusion in the perceived objectives of RRBs over time. Despite the pressures  of credit expansion, improvement in recovery performance, profit orientation  and strict compliances to banking norms, the general perception has been that  RRBs have got only social objectives, without any viability consideration,  which has to be changed.<br />
                    <strong>viii)</strong> <strong>Financial  management skills: </strong>Poor financial management skills, coupled with pressures  from various quarters (like sponsor banks) appears to have resulted in  inefficient allocation of resources by RRBs which in turn is reflected in the  high incidence of NPAs and parking of large funds with sponsor banks ( policy  changed in 2002-03 ) .<br />
                    <strong>ix)</strong> <strong>Staff  structure: </strong>Limited exposure and lack of appropriate training, has resulted  in RRBs staff lacking the necessary skills and capacity to cater to the  changing requirements of the rural sector. Furthermore, the ban on recruitment  has also resulted in ageing staff structure constraining efficiency in  operations. Uniform norms and personnel policies have been applied to RRBs  through out the country ignoring local touch thereby causing staff unrest, poor  industrial relations, innumerable litigations and lowering of staff morale as  also their involvement with the development tasks (Rao Committee, 2002).<br />
                    <strong>x)</strong> <strong>Dependence  on sponsor banks</strong>: Another weakness observed in the case of RRBs is their  failure to adequately integrate with the financial markets of the country due  to their heavy dependence on sponsor banks for financial/ business initiatives.  RRBs are also some times perceived as potential competitors, due to the  presence of the sponsor banks in the same area of operation. Despite the best  intentions at the policy levels in sponsor banks, the RRBs have suffered at the  ground level wherever there has been any conflict of business interests of RRBs  and their sponsor banks. RRBs have therefore, not been able to establish  systems and procedures required for providing efficient services to their  clients, as also for efficient management of their financial resources.<br />
                    <strong>xi)</strong> <strong>Professionalism  in management: </strong>The Chairmen of most of the RRBs are from sponsor banks,  which limits the freedom and decision making capacity of the RRBs. Even for  small matters RRBs have to refer to their sponsor banks, which lead to delay in  decision-making and reduce efficiency. Furthermore, the Board of Directors of  RRBs may not always function effectively as some of the members do not have  necessary skills and expertise to take important financial decisions.<br />
                    <strong>xii)</strong> <strong>Erosion  of deposits</strong>: In the case of few RRBs, there has also been an erosion of  public deposits, besides capital.<strong> </strong></p>
