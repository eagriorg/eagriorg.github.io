				<p><strong>RESERVE  BANK OF INDIA</strong><br />
            The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) war  established in April 1, 1935, in accordance with the provisions of the RBI Act,  1934. The Agricultural Credit Department (ACD) was organized 1935 to  co-ordinate the Bank's operations with State Co-operative Banks and other banks  and organization dealing with agricultural credit., Financing agriculture by  commercial banks is looked after by the Department of Banking Operations and  Development (DBOD) while ACD continued to take care of co-operative credit may  be viewed from three aspects:<br />
            a) Provision of finance.<br />
            b) Promotional Activities, and <br />
            c) Regulatory functions.<br />
<strong>a)  Provision of Finance</strong><br />
            RBI extends short, medium and  long-term credits to agriculture through co-operative channels. The bulk of the  credit granted by the RBI related to short-term to meet Seasonal Agricultural  Operations (SAO). The RBI Act was amended in 1955 to provide for the  establishment of two funds, viz., National Agricultural credit (Long Term Operations)  Fund and National Agricultural Credit (Stabilization) Fund. The three  components of medium-term credit are: a) loans for purchasing shares in  co-operative processing societies, b) loans for agricultural and other allied  purposes, including animal husbandry and pisciculture and c) conversion of  short-term agricultural loans into medium term loans when repayment becomes  difficult due to natural calamities. While ' the first two ((a) and (b)) are  financed out of the NAC (LTO) fund and the (c) (Last one) is out of NAC  (stabilization) fund.<br />
            The RBI provides long-term credit as  loans to the state governments for contribution to the share capital of the  co-operative credit institutions and to NABARD. The RRBs get refinance facility  from the RBI up to 50 per cent of their out standing advances.<br />
<strong>b)  Promotional Activities</strong><br />
            Under rehabilitation programme, most  of the co­operative banks have attained viable status. The Study Teams  appointed by the RBI have given constructive suggestions to reorganize the co-operative  structure on sound lines.  The following  need special mention: the Committee on Co-operative Land Development Banks  (1974), the Committee on Integration of Co-Operative Credit Institutions (1976)  committee to study the Interest Rates Spreads in Agricultural Lending Sector  etc.</p>
				<p>RBI introduced  production-oriented credit by means of crop loan system. It has evolved norms  to extend medium ­term finance. It has been issuing appropriate guidelines to  Land Development Banks for purposeful and productive utilization of resources.  The benefit of deposit insurance cover has been extended to the co-operative  banks operative banks so as to facilitate mobilization of deposits. <br />
				  The RBI evolved a scheme to finance  the weak PACS by commercial banks. It initiated the Lead Bank Scheme in 1969  and its impact is seen in branch expansion and other activities of the  commercial banks. It advised the banks to participate­ effectively in the  Integrated Rural Development Programme and extend loans to the weaker sections. <br />
  <strong>c)  Regulatory Functions</strong><br />
				  As a lender, the RBI not only  concerned itself with the quantity of credit but also attempted to improve the  quality of credit extended and also the efficiency of the channels through  which it is provided to the rural sector. The co­operative banks were brought  under certain provisions of the Banking Regulation Act and of the RBI Act in  1966. This enabled the RBI to effectively supervise the co-operative banks as  it does over the commercial banks. Under the Credit Authorization Scheme  (1976), the co-operative banks should get prior authorization from RBI for  providing finance beyond a limit. The RBI frames the overall credit policy on  the basis of the credit needs of agriculture. Limits to credit institutions are  fixed by taking into account the demand for credit and not just arbitrarily. <br />
				  The cash / liquidity ratios  applicable to co-operatives are lower than those fixed for commercial banks.  The co-ope­ratives are enabled to borrow from the RBI at an interest rate which  is three per cent below the bank rate in respect of crop loans. They are also  permitted to pay slightly higher rates of interest on their deposits. The  refinancing functions of RBI relation to rural credit were function of RBI  relation to rural credit was taken over by NABARD after its formation in 1982.<br />
  <strong>NATIONAL  BANK FOR AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT (NABARD)</strong><br />
				  On the basis of the views expressed  by the All India Rural credit Review Committee (1969), the Administrative  Reforms Commission (1970) , the banking Commission (1972), and the National  Commission on agriculture (1976), the Committee to Review the Arrangements for  Institutional credit for Agriculture and Rural Development (CRAFICARD)  appointed by the RBI under the chairmanship of B. Sivaraman in 1979 considered  the desirability and the feasibility of establishing a national bank for rural  development in the context of integrated rural development. While examining the  activities of the ARDC and the RBI in the delivery of rural credit against  massive credit needs for rural development over the coming years, the CRAFICARD  felt that the present national level institutions had certain deficiencies  affecting their capacity to meet the stupendous task of integrated rural  development aimed at the uplift of the weaker sections in the rural areas  within a given time horizon.<br />
				  The CRAFICARD considered that the  ARDCIL was unable to ensure the necessary supporting short-term credit and also  the ARDC could not support non-land based activities which are also to be  promoted in the context of implementation of IRDP. The committee considered  whether the top management of the RBI in the midst of its multifarious  functions could devote sufficient attention to the complex credit problems  involved in the integrated rural development. The committee also felt that the  Agricultural Credit Board (ACB) which was established in 1970 in the place of  the then Standing Advisory Committee on Rural Co-operative Credit could not  solve the complex issues of rural credit by holding a few meetings in a year.  For all these reasons, the committee recommended for the establishment of  NABARD and hence it was started, functioning since 12th July 1982.<br />
				  As such it has replaced by merging  in itself, the ARDC and the two credit related constituents of the RBI, namely,  Agricultural Credit Department and the Rural Planning and Credit Cell (RPCC)  (The RRBs which were initially, dealt with by DBOD, was placed under the charge  of the RPCC in 1979). Thus, NABARD is conceived as an exercise of  decentralization of the RBIs functions relating rural credit and that it would  take over the ARDC and the refinancing functions of RBI in relation to State  Co-operative Banks and RRBs.<br />
  <strong>Resources</strong><br />
				  The share capital of NABARD is Rs.  100 crores and is held by the RBI and GOI in equal proportion. The NABARD draws  funds from the RBI for its short-term operations, and for long-term operations,  it draws funds from the Government of India, floats bonds in the open market  and also draws from its National Agricultural Credit (Long Term operations)  Fund and National Agricultural Credit (Stabilization) Fund. The NABARD is also  authorized to accept deposits with maturity period of not less than twelve  months from the central and state Governments, local authorities, scheduled  banks etc. and also to borrow foreign currency with the approval of central  government.<br />
  <strong>Management</strong><br />
				  The management of NABARD is vested  with a 15 member ­Board of Management which consists of a Chairman, a Managing  Director and 13 Executive Directors. The chairman is the ex-officio Deputy  Governor of RBI. The Managing Director is the Chief Executive of the Bank with  operational respon­sibility for the performance of various tasks. The Executive  Director will be in charge of each of the major functional divisions i.e., two  Directors from central government, three sitting Directors from co-operatives  and commercial Banks and two experts on rural economy and rural development.  The Board of Directors can constitute an Advisory Council. <br />
				  The two Directors from state  Governments will be appointed by rotation to give representation to five Zones,  viz., Northern, Southern, Eastern, Western and North-Eastern. NABARD will be,  thus, broadly divided into five zones with its head quarters at Bombay Mumbai  and 16 regional offices located in   i)  Jammu, ii) Chandigarh, iii) Lucknow, iv) Patna, v) Gauhati, vi) KoCalkacutta,  vii) Bhubaneshwar,   viii) Hydrabad, ix)  Bangalore, x) Madras (Chennai), xi) Trivandram, xii) Mumbai (Bombay), xiii) Iindore,  xiv) Ahamadabad, xv) New Delhi and xvi) Jaipur. <br />
				  &quot;National  Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development is established as a Development Bank  for providing and regulating credit and other facilities for the promotion and  development of agriculture, small industries, cottage and village industries,  handicrafts and other rural crafts and other allied economic activities in  rural areas with a view to promoting integrated rural development and securing  prosperity of rural areas and for matters connected therewith or incidental  thereto&quot;.<br />
  <strong>1. Mission</strong><br />
				  Promoting  sustainable and equitable agriculture and rural prosperity through effective  credit support, related services, institution development and other <br />
				  innovative initiatives.<br />
  <strong>2. Types of Services</strong><br />
				  In  order to achieve this mission, NABARD undertakes a number of inter-related  activities / services which fall under three broad categories viz., credit  dispensation, developmental and promotional and supervisory.<br />

				<p><strong>3. Customers of the Bank </strong> <br />
				  The  customers of NABARD are Cooperative Banks, State Land development Bank,  Scheduled Commercial Banks, Urban Cooperative Banks and such financial  institutions as may be approved by RBI. Further, NABARD also deals with  voluntary agencies/NGOs besides various State Governments. While discharging  various credit functions, NABARD has no direct business dealings with public at  large, although all the functions are directed at securing and promoting  integrated rural development and prosperity of rural areas. The interaction  between NABARD staff and the ultimate borrowers i.e., farmers, artisans,  craftsmen and entrepreneurs, takes place while conducting a number of field  level studies, fostering the growth of the SHG bank linkage, developing Vikas  Volunteer Vahini (VVV) and sanctioning/monitoring the various promotional  schemes under NFS/FS. NABARD has recently introduced the Capital Gains Bonds  and these bonds are subscribed by publics<br />
  <strong>4. Quality of Service</strong><br />
				  4.1 NABARD has a complement of suitably  qualified and experienced staff in the following areas:</p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>General       Banking</li>
				  <li>Agriculture       and related services such as Irrigation, Plantation and Horticulture, Land       Development, Agriculture Engineering, Bio-technology, Fisheries, Forestry,       etc. </li>
				  <li>Agriculture       Economics</li>
				  <li>Information       Technology</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>            The  staff provide need-based services to its client banks, state governments, SHGs  / NGOs which ultimately serve the interest of agriculture and rural  development. NABARD through its District Development Managers and Regional  Offices deals with client banks, State Governments and voluntary agencies. It  has been the endeavour of NABARD to provide various credit and financial  services to the RFIs timely and efficiently. The above customers of NABARD, in  turn, have public at large, as their customers. Thus, indirectly NABARD is  responsible for giving timely services to these clients to enable them to act timely  with their customers i.e., general public at large. <br />
                    <strong>4.2</strong> To improve the quality of service as well as keeping in tune with the emerging  developments in Information Technology, NABARD has launched an Action Plan on  information technology and its implementation has been vigorously pursued.  Networking environment has been introduced in NABARD phasing out the earlier  mini computer systems. Advanced version and custom-made software packages have  been introduced for computerizing additional functional areas. Flow of  information and data between RO and HO as also between departments of HO  through electronic media is being progressively adopted facilitating faster  promotion of information and data, e-mail and related facilities. Upgrading the  skills and imparting knowledge is the theme of our training efforts for staff  so as to improve productivity, make the Organization efficient and emerge as a  learning organization.</p>
				<p><strong>5.  Performance Standards</strong> <br />
				  NABARD  has always maintained high standards of performance and made efforts to bring  about similar performance standards for its client banks/institutions. To  supervise its operations and performance, NABARD has its own internal  Inspection Department which periodically undertakes inspection of its all HO  Departments and ROs. A system of concurrent audit of the financial transactions  is also in place. The Bank is also audited by the statutory auditors appointed  by GOI and inspected by RBI every year. Innovation and creativity are  encouraged through participative management practices and a Staff Suggestion  Scheme is in place to share their ideas for better products and customer  satisfaction.<br />
  <strong>6.  Grievance Redressal</strong><br />
				  NABARD  has its own internal redressal machinery viz. Central Vigilance Cell which has  been established as per the directions of Central Vigilance Commission of GOI.  It has appointed Chief Vigilance Officer at HO and Vigilance officer at ROs.  The internal systems and Procedures are well laid down and under constant  scrutiny of Concurrent Audit and Vigilance Cell. A strong Internal Audit and  Inspection mechanism is in place besides the Statutory Audit by Professional  Auditors and inspection by RBI. A notice board is kept for public at large in  all NABARD office premises indicating the names of Chief Vigilance Officer/Vigilance  officer to be contacted by the public in case of need. As far as client banks  (SCBs, SCARDBs, RRBs, CCB and commercial banks) are concerned, the complaints  against their staff when made to NABARD are attended effectively and it is  ensured at various levels that no complaint is left unattended. <br />
  <strong>7.  Access to information</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>NABARD  has its own website and its address is www.nabard.org. The website highlights  all major areas of its functioning and broadly indicates all matters relating  to organization, role and functions, operations, rural economy, international  associates, addresses of its offices, etc. The general public at large may, if  required on matters relating to credit for agriculture and rural development  approach HO, ROs or DDMs of NABARD whose addresses are given in the above  website. The National Bank Home Page is updated periodically to provide latest  information on the policy changes, operations, etc. Apart from the website  NABARD has its own Public Relation Officer to disseminate any information  relating to the Organization, agriculture and rural development and related  policies adopted by the Organization. The information relating to agriculture,  rural development, banking, etc. are also published by NABARD through its  various publications such as books, periodicals, booklets, etc. in both Hindi  and English and some periodicals even in local languages.

				  With a view to improve the quality  of credit plans, and also to organize, co-ordinate and effectively monitor  them, NABARD will be setting District Level Offices in all the districts in the  country inn a phased manner in the (VIII) plan. In the first phase, the NABARD  has already set up 43 such offices. These offices would also prepare a  potential linked credit plan for each district which would serve as a basis for  the preparation of Annual credit plans by the branches of commercial banks.<br />
				  In  future, NABARD will give special attention to the development of dry land  farming, and increasing the production of oil seeds and pulses which are in  short supply. It will bring about nexus between producers and input suppliers,  marketing agencies and extension services to ensure remunerative employment for  the rural artisans.<br />

				<p><strong>ASIAN  DEVELOPMENT BANK</strong><br />
				  ADB was  conceived amid the postwar rehabilitation and reconstruction of the early  1960s. The vision was of a financial institution that would be Asian in  character and foster economic growth and cooperation in the region - then one  of the poorest in the world. The Philippines capital of Manila was chosen to  host the new institution - the Asian Development Bank - which opened its doors  on 19 December 1966, with 31 members to serve a predominantly agricultural  region. Through the years, ADB's work and assistance levels has expanded  alongside its <a href="http://www.adb.org/About/membership.asp">membership</a> as the  region has undergone far-reaching changes. As 2007 drew to a close, ADB  celebrated 41 years of fruitful cooperation with the governments and peoples of  the Asia and Pacific region. It could look back on phenomenal economic growth  in the region alongside abiding development challenges.</p>
				<p>            ADB is an  international development finance institution whose mission is to help its  developing member countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of  their people. Headquartered in Manila, and established in 1966, ADB is owned  and financed by its <a href="http://www.adb.org/About/membership.asp">67 members</a>, of which  48 are from the region and 19 are from other parts of the globe. ADB's main  partners are governments, the <a href="http://www.adb.org/poverty/private-sector.asp">private sector</a>, <a href="http://www.adb.org/NGOs/default.asp">nongovernment organizations</a>, development  agencies, community-based organizations, and foundations. Under <a href="http://www.adb.org/Strategy2020/default.asp">Strategy 2020</a>, a long-term strategic framework  adopted in 2008, ADB will follow three complementary strategic agendas: <a href="http://www.adb.org/poverty/inclusive-social.asp">inclusive growth</a>, <a href="http://www.adb.org/poverty/environmental-sustainability.asp">environmentally sustainable  growth</a>, and <a href="http://www.adb.org/poverty/regional-cooperation.asp">regional integration</a>.  In pursuing its vision, ADB's main instruments comprise loans, technical  assistance, grants, advice, and knowledge. Although most lending is in the  public sector - and to governments - ADB also provides direct assistance to  private enterprises of developing countries through equity investments,  guarantees, and loans. In addition, its <a href="http://www.adb.org/Bond-Investors/default.asp">triple-A credit<span title=""> </span> rating</a> helps  mobilize funds for development (http://www.adb.org/About).<br />
                    <strong>Operations: </strong> 
				For  more than 40 years, ADB has supported projects in agriculture and natural  resources, energy, finance, industry and nonfuel minerals, social  infrastructure, and transport and communications. More than half of ADB's  assistance has gone into building infrastructure - roads, airports, power  plants, and water and sanitation facilities. Such infrastructure helps lay the  foundation for commerce and economic growth and makes essential services  accessible to                the poor.   In addition to loans, grants, and technical assistance, ADB uses  guarantees and equity investments to help its developing member countries.<br />
Organization <br />
            The highest decision making tier at ADB is its <a href="http://www.adb.org/GOV/default.asp">Board of Governors</a>, to which each of ADB's 67  members nominate one Governor and an Alternate Governor to represent them. The  Board of Governors meets formally once a year at an Annual Meeting held in a  member country. The Governors' day to day responsibilities are largely  delegated to the 12-person <a href="http://www.adb.org/BOD/default.asp">Board of Directors</a>,  which performs its duties full time at ADB's HQ in Manila. The <a href="http://www.adb.org/About/President/">ADB President</a>, under the Board's direction,  conducts the business of ADB. The President is elected by the Board of  Governors for a term of five years and may be reelected. Since its foundation  in 1966, ADB's Headquarters has been based in Manila, Philippines. Its present  building in the business district of Ortigas, Mandaluyong City, was opened in  1991 and accommodates about 3,000 personnel. ADB also has <a href="http://www.adb.org/Countries/">30 field offices</a>, including resident and regional  missions, a country office, a liaison office, and representative offices. The  field offices give vital support to the operations and outreach work of ADB's  Manila Headquarters. They carry out much of ADB's operational roles of country  programming, processing of loan and grant assistance, project.</p>
				<h2>Management</h2>
				<p>            The President is Chairperson of the  Board of Directors, and under the Board's direction, conducts the business of  ADB. He is responsible for the organization, appointment, and dismissal of the  officers and staff in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board of  Directors. The President is elected by the Board of Governors for a term of  five years, and may be reelected. He is also the legal representative of ADB.  On 17 April 2006, the Board of Directors approved the recommendation on the  reassignment of the functions and duties of the operations vice presidents. The  President has also approved the structure of the four realigned regional  departments, effective 1 May 2006. The President now heads a management team  comprising five Vice-Presidents and the Managing Director General, who  supervise the work of ADB's operational, administrative, and knowledge  departments.</p>
				<h2>Policies and Strategies</h2>
				<p>            In 2008, ADB's  Board of Directors approved <a href="http://www.adb.org/documents/Policies/Strategy2020/default.asp?p=strtg">Strategy 2020: The Long-Term  Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008-2020</a>. It is  the paramount ADB-wide strategic framework to guide all its operations to 2020.  In 2009, ADB's Board of Governors has agreed to triple ADB's capital base from  $55 billion to $165 billion, giving it much-needed  resources to respond to the global economic crisis and to the longer-term  development needs of the Asia and Pacific region. Voting by ADB's 67 member  countries on GCI V closed on 29 April 2009, with an overwhelming majority of  members endorsing it. The 200% increase is ADB's largest, and the first since  ADB increased its capital by 100% in 1994.<br />
				  Strategy  2020 reaffirms both ADB's vision of an <a href="http://adbweb/Documents/Policies/Poverty_Reduction/2004/prs-2004.pdf">Asia and Pacific free of poverty</a> and its mission to help developing member countries improve the living  conditions and quality of life of their people.<br />
				  Strategy 2020 identifies drivers of  change that will be stressed in all its operations—developing the private  sector, encouraging good governance, supporting gender equity, helping  developing countries gain knowledge, and expanding partnerships with other  development institutions the private sector, and with community-based  organizations.<br />
				  By  2012, 80% of ADB lending will be in five core operational areas, identified as  comparative strengths of ADB:</p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Infrastructure,       including transport and communications, energy, water supply and       sanitation and urban development </li>
				  <li>Environment </li>
				  <li>Regional cooperation       and integration </li>
				  <li>Finance sector       development </li>
				  <li>Education </li>
</ul>
				<p>ADB will continue to operate in health, agriculture, and disaster  and emergency assistance, but on a more selective basis. ADB has developed a <a href="http://adbweb/Documents/Policies/ADB-Results-Framework/r166-08.pdf">corporate results framework</a> [ PDF ] to assess its progress in implementing Strategy 2020. Annually, it will  monitor implementation through the <a href="http://adbweb/Documents/Reports/Development-Effectiveness-Review/">ADB Development Effectiveness  Review</a>.<br />

                    <strong>WORLD  BANK</strong><br />
                    <strong>History</strong><br />
				  Since inception in 1944, the World  Bank has expanded from a single institution to a closely associated group of  five development institutions. Our mission evolved from the International Bank  for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) as facilitator of post-war  reconstruction and development to the present day mandate of worldwide poverty  alleviation in close coordination with our affiliate, the International  Development Association, and other members of the World Bank Group, the <a href="http://www.ifc.org/">International Finance Corporation  (IFC)</a>, the <a href="http://www.miga.org">Multilateral  Guarantee Agency (MIGA)</a>, and the International Centre for the  Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).<br />
				  Once we had a homogeneous staff of  engineers and financial analysts, based solely in Washington, DC. Today, we  have a multidisciplinary and diverse staff that includes economists, public  policy experts, sector experts and social scientists-and now more than a third  of our staff is based in country offices. Reconstruction remains an important  part of our work. However, the global challenges in the world compel us to  focus on: </p>

</ul>
				<p>            At today's World Bank, poverty  reduction through an inclusive and sustainable globalization remains the  overarching goal of our work. <br />
				  The World Bank is a vital source of  financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the world.  Its mission is to fight poverty with passion and professionalism for lasting  results and to help people help themselves and their environment by providing  resources, sharing knowledge, building capacity and forging partnerships in the  public and private sectors. We are not a bank in the common sense; we are made  up of two unique development institutions owned by 187 member countries: the <a href="http://go.worldbank.org/SDUHVGE5S0">International  Bank for Reconstruction and Development</a> (IBRD) and the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/ida/">International  Development Association</a> (IDA). Each institution plays a different  but collaborative role in advancing the vision of inclusive and sustainable  globalization. The IBRD aims to reduce poverty in middle-income and  creditworthy poorer countries, while IDA focuses on the world's poorest  countries.<br />
				  Their work is complemented by that  of the<a href="http://www.ifc.org/"> International  Finance Corporation</a> (IFC), <a href="http://www.miga.org/">Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency</a> (MIGA)  and the<a href="http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/Index.jsp"> International Centre for the Settlement of Investment  Disputes</a> (ICSID). Together, we provide low-interest loans,  interest-free credits and grants to developing countries for a wide array of  purposes that include investments in education, health, public administration,  infrastructure, financial and private sector development, agriculture and  environmental and natural resource management. <br />
				  The World Bank, established in 1944,  is headquartered in Washington, D.C. We have more than 10,000 employees in more  than 100 offices worldwide. (<a href="http://web.worldbank.org">http://web.worldbank.org</a>). To  ensure countries continue to have access to the best global expertise and  cutting-edge knowledge, the World Bank Group is revising its programs to assist  the poor, as well as its range of financing options, to meet pressing  development priorities. <br />
  <strong>Challenges</strong><br />
				  The World Bank had made the world's  challenge—to reduce global poverty- the bank’s challenge. The Bank focuses on  achievement of the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/mdgs/">Millennium Development Goals</a> that call for the  elimination of poverty and sustained development. The goals provide the bank  with targets and yardsticks for measuring results. The bank’s mission is to  help developing countries and their people reach the goals by working with our  partners to alleviate poverty. It   addresses <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTABOUTUS/0,,contentMDK:21693286~menuPK:4851994~pagePK:51123644~piPK:329829~theSitePK:29708,00.html">global challenges</a> in ways that advance an  inclusive and sustainable globalization—that overcome poverty, enhance growth  with care for the environment, and create individual opportunity and hope. <br />

  <strong>Organisation</strong><br />
				  The World Bank is like a  cooperative, where its 187 member countries are shareholders. The shareholders  are represented by a <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTABOUTUS/0,,contentMDK:20873632~menuPK:1696997~pagePK:51123644~piPK:329829~theSitePK:29708,00.html">Board of Governors</a>, who are the ultimate policy  makers at the World Bank. Generally, the governors are member countries'  ministers of finance or ministers of development. They meet once a year at the <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTABOUTUS/0,,contentMDK:20042540~menuPK:58865~pagePK:51123644~piPK:329829~theSitePK:29708,00.html">Annual Meetings</a> of the Boards of Governors of  the <a href="http://www.worldbankgroup.org/">World Bank  Group</a> and the <a href="http://www.imf.org/">International  Monetary Fund</a>.<br />
				  Because the governors only meet  annually, they delegate specific duties to 25 <a href="http://go.worldbank.org/RRBDU3PQQ0">Executive  Directors</a>, who work on-site at the Bank. The five largest  shareholders, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States  appoint an executive director, while other member countries are represented by  20 executive directors.</p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>The <a href="http://go.worldbank.org/IHDUWCAI20">President of the World Bank</a>, <a href="http://go.worldbank.org/IHDUWCAI20">Robert B.       Zoellick</a>, chairs meetings of the Boards of Directors and is       responsible for overall management of the Bank. By tradition, the Bank       president is a U.S. national and is nominated by the United States, the       Bank's largest shareholder. The President is selected by the Board of       Executive Directors for a five-year, renewable term. </li>
				  <li>The <a href="http://go.worldbank.org/RRBDU3PQQ0">Executive Directors</a> make up the <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTABOUTUS/ORGANIZATION/BODEXT/0,,pagePK:64020055~theSitePK:278036,00.html">Boards of Directors</a> of the World Bank.       They normally meet at least twice a week to oversee the Bank's business,       including approval of loans and guarantees, new policies, the       administrative budget, country assistance strategies and borrowing and       financial decisions.</li>
</ul>
				<p>The World Bank  operates day-to-day under the leadership and direction of the president,  management and senior staff, and the vice presidents in charge of regions,  sectors, networks and functions.

                    <strong>Operations</strong><br />
				  The World Bank's two closely  affiliated entities—the <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTABOUTUS/EXTIBRD/0,,menuPK:3046081~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:3046012,00.html">International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  (IBRD)</a> and the <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTABOUTUS/IDA/0,,menuPK:83991~pagePK:118644~piPK:51236156~theSitePK:73154,00.html">International Development Association (IDA)</a>—provide  low or no interest loans (credits) and grants to countries that have  unfavorable or no access to international credit markets. Unlike other  financial institutions, we do not operate for profit. The IBRD is market-based,  and we use our high credit rating to pass the low interest we pay for money on  to our borrowers—developing countries. We pay for our own operating costs,  since we don’t look to outside sources to furnish funds for overhead.<br />
				  So, where does the money come from  to operate the World Bank, and how do we use the funds to carry out our  mission?</p>
				<h2>Fund  Generation</h2>
				<p>            IBRD lending to developing countries  is primarily financed by <a href="http://treasury.worldbank.org/Services/Capital+Markets/index.html">selling AAA-rated bonds</a> in the world's  financial markets. While IBRD earns a small margin on this lending, the greater  proportion of its income comes from lending out its own capital. This capital  consists of reserves built up over the years and money paid in from the Bank's  185 member country shareholders. IBRD’s income also pays for World Bank  operating expenses and has contributed to IDA and debt relief.<br />
				  IDA is the world's largest source of  interest-free loans and grant assistance to the poorest countries. IDA's funds  are <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTABOUTUS/IDA/0,,contentMDK:21021125~menuPK:2842661~pagePK:51236175~piPK:437394~theSitePK:73154,00.html">replenished every three years</a> by 40 donor  countries. Additional funds are regenerated through repayments of loan principal  on 35-to-40-year, no-interest loans, which are then available for re-lending.  IDA accounts for more than 40% of our lending.</p>
				<h2>Loans</h2>
				<p>            Through the IBRD and IDA, we offer  two basic types of loans and credits: <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/PROJECTS/0,,contentMDK:20120732~menuPK:268725~pagePK:41367~piPK:51533~theSitePK:40941,00.html">investment operations and development policy operations</a>.<br />
				  Countries use investment operations  for goods, works and services in support of economic and social development  projects in a broad range of economic and social sectors. Development policy  operations (formerly known as adjustment loans) provide quick-disbursing  financing to support a country’s policy and institutional reforms.<br />
				  Each borrower’s project proposal is  assessed to ensure that the project is economically, financially, socially and  environmentally sound. During loan negotiations, the Bank and borrower agree on  the development objectives, outputs, performance indicators and implementation  plan, as well as a loan disbursement schedule. While we supervise the  implementation of each loan and evaluate its results, the borrower implements  the project or program according to the agreed terms. As more than 30% of our  staff is based in over 100 country offices worldwide, three-fourths of  outstanding loans are managed by country directors located away from the World  Bank offices in Washington.<br />
				  IDA long term loans (credits) are  interest free but do carry a small service charge of 0.75 percent on funds paid  out. IDA commitment fees range from zero to 0.5 percent on undisbursed credit  balances. For FY09 commitment fees have been set at 0.0 percent.<br />

				<p><strong>INSURANCE AND CREDIT GUARANTEE CORPORATION OF INDIA</strong><br />
                    <strong>History</strong><br />
				  The concept of insuring deposits  kept with banks received attention for the first time in the year 1948 after  the banking crises in Bengal. The question came up for reconsideration in the  year 1949, but it was decided to hold it in abeyance till the Reserve Bank of  India ensured adequate arrangements for inspection of banks. Subsequently, in  the year 1950, the Rural Banking Enquiry Committee also supported the concept.  Serious thought to the concept was, however, given by the Reserve Bank of India  and the Central Government after the crash of the Palai Central Bank Ltd., and  the Laxmi Bank Ltd. in 1960. The Deposit Insurance Corporation (DIC) Bill was  introduced in the Parliament on August 21, 1961. After it was passed by the  Parliament, the Bill got the assent of the President on December 7, 1961 and  the Deposit Insurance Act, 1961 came into force on January 1, 1962.&nbsp; <br />
				  The Deposit Insurance Scheme was  initially extended to functioning commercial banks only. This included the  State Bank of India and its subsidiaries, other commercial banks and the  branches of the foreign banks operating in India.&nbsp;<br />
				  Since 1968, with the enactment of  the Deposit Insurance Corporation (Amendment) Act, 1968, the Corporation was  required to register the 'eligible co-operative banks' as insured banks under  the provisions of Section 13 A of the Act. An eligible co-operative bank means  a co-operative bank (whether it is a State co-operative bank, a Central  co-operative bank or a Primary co-operative bank) in a State which has passed  the enabling legislation amending its Co-operative Societies Act, requiring the  State Government to vest power in the Reserve Bank to order the Registrar of  Co-operative Societies of a State to wind up a co-operative bank or to  supersede its Committee of Management and to require the Registrar not to take  any action for winding up, amalgamation or reconstruction of a co-operative  bank without prior sanction in writing from the Reserve Bank of India.&nbsp;<br />
				  Further, the Government of India, in  consultation with the Reserve Bank of India, introduced a Credit Guarantee  Scheme in July 1960. The Reserve Bank of India was entrusted with the  administration of the Scheme, as an agent of the Central Government, under  Section 17 (11 A)(a) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 and was designated  as the Credit Guarantee Organization (CGO) for guaranteeing the advances  granted by banks and other Credit Institutions to small scale industries. The  Reserve Bank of India operated the scheme up to March 31, 1981.&nbsp;<br />
				  The Reserve Bank of India also  promoted a public limited company on January 14, 1971, named the Credit  Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. (CGCI). The main thrust of the Credit Guarantee  Schemes, introduced by the Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd., was  aimed at encouraging the commercial banks to cater to the credit needs of the  hitherto neglected sectors, particularly the weaker sections of the society  engaged in non-industrial activities, by providing guarantee cover to the loans  and advances granted by the credit institutions to small and needy borrowers  covered under the priority sector.&nbsp;<br />
				  With a view to integrating the  functions of deposit insurance and credit guarantee, the above two  organizations (DIC &amp; CGCI) were merged and the present Deposit Insurance  and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) came into existence on July 15, 1978.  Consequently, the title of Deposit Insurance Act, 1961 was changed to 'The Deposit  Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation Act, 1961 '.&nbsp;<br />
				  Effective from April 1, 1981, the  Corporation extended its guarantee support to credit granted to small scale  industries also, after the cancellation of the Government of India's credit  guarantee scheme. With effect from April 1, 1989, guarantee cover was extended  to the entire priority sector advances, as per the definition of the Reserve  Bank of India. However, effective from April 1, 1995, all housing loans have  been excluded from the purview of guarantee cover by the Corporation. <br />
				  The  introduction of credit guarantee schemes by the erstwhile Credit Guarantee  Corporation of India Limited was part of a series of measures taken since the  late sixties aimed at encouraging the commercial banks to cater to the late  requirements of the hitherto neglected sectors, particularly weaker sections of  society. In the wake of the social control measures initiated in 1968 followed  by nationalization of major commercial banks, the banks were required to ensure  an increased flow of credit to smaller borrowers who found it difficult to have  access to institutional credit. While there was an increasing awareness among  banks of the need to provide more credit to such borrowers, certain practical  difficulties were encountered. The Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd.,  was thus visualised as an agency to provide a simple but wide-ranging system of  guarantees for loans granted by credit institutions to such small and needy  borrowers (http://www.dicgc.org.in)<br />
				  With  a view to integrate the twin and cognate functions of deposit insurance and  credit guarantee, the Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Limited and the  Deposit Insurance Corporation were merged in July 1978 and the corporation was  renamed as the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation. </p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Deposit  Insurance Scheme Institutional Coverage:</strong> </li>
</ul>
				<p>The deposit insurance scheme was introduced  with effect from 1 January 1962. The Scheme provides automatic coverage for  deposits of all commercial banks (including regional rural banks) received in  India. Following an amendment to the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee  Corporation Act in 1968, similar coverage is also extended in respect of  deposits with co-operative banks in such of the states, as have passed the enabling  legislation amending their local co-operative societies Acts. In terms of  geographical coverage, the benefit of deposit insurance now stands extended to  the entire banking system leaving uncovered only 69 cooperative banks in such  of the states as have yet to pass the necessary legislation.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Extent  of Insurance cover:</strong> </li>
</ul>
				<p>Under the scheme, in the event of  liquidation, reconstruction or amalgamation of an insured bank, every depositor  of that bank is entitled to repayment of his deposits in all branches of that  bank, held by him in the same capacity and right, subject to a monetary ceiling  of Rs.1,00,000/-.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Insurance  premium:</strong> </li>
</ul>
				<p>The consideration for extension of insurance  coverage to banks is payment of an insurance premium at the rate of 5 paise per  annum per hundred rupees. The premium is collected at half-yearly intervals.  The banks are required to bear this fee so that the protection of insurance in  available to the depositors free of cost. The corporation can levy a maximum  premium of up to Rs. 0.15 per Rs. 100 per annum.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Payment  of Insurance claims:</strong> </li>
</ul>
				<p>When a bank goes into liquidation, the  corporation pays to every depositor, through the liquidator, the amount of  deposits up to Rs.1,00,000/-. When bank is amalgamated with an other bank and  the scheme of amalgamation does not entitle the depositor to get credit for the  full amount of his deposit, the corporation pays to each depositor the  difference between the full amount of the deposit (or Rs.1,00,000/- whichever  is less) and the amount actually received by him under the scheme of  amalgamation. After settling a claim, the liquidator/transferee bank is  required to repay to the corporation, by virtue of such rights of subrogation,  recoveries effected by it from out of the assets of the insured bank in liquidation/amalgamation. <br />
				  The Head Office of the DICGC is located at Mumbai  and It has branch offices at Calcutta, Madras,  New Delhi and Nagpur. <br />
  <a name="LFO" id="LFO"></a>Legal Framework/Objective<br />
				  The functions of the DICGC are  governed by the provisions of 'The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee  Corporation Act, 1961' (DICGC Act) and 'The Deposit Insurance and Credit  Guarantee Corporation General Regulations, 1961' framed by the Reserve Bank of  India in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (3) of Section 50 of  the said Act. The preamble of the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee  Corporation Act, 1961 states that it is an Act to provide for the establishment  of a Corporation for the purpose of insurance of deposits and guaranteeing of  credit facilities and for other matters connected therewith or incidental  thereto. <br />
  <strong>Organization and Functions</strong><br />
  <a name="OF" id="OF"></a><a name="Man" id="Man"></a><strong>Management</strong> <br />
				  The authorized capital of the  Corporation is Rs.50 crore, which is fully issued and subscribed by the Reserve  Bank of India (RBI). The management of the Corporation vests with its Board of  Directors, of which a Deputy Governor of the RBI is the Chairman. As per the  DICGC Act, the Board shall consist of, besides the Chairman, (i) one Officer  (normally in the rank of Executive Director) of the RBI, (ii) one Officer from the  Central Government, (iii) five Directors nominated by the Central Government in  consultation with the RBI, three of whom are persons having special knowledge  of commercial banking, insurance, commerce, industry or finance and two of whom  shall be persons having special knowledge of, or experience in co-operative  banking or co-operative movement and none of the directors should be an  employee of the Central Government, or the RBI or the Corporation or a director  or an employee of a banking company or a co-operative bank, or otherwise  actively connected with a banking company or a co-operative bank, and (iv) four  Directors, nominated by the Central Government in consultation with the RBI,  having special knowledge or practical experience in respect of accountancy,  agriculture and rural economy, banking, co-operation, economics, finance, law  or small scale industry or any other matter which may be considered to be  useful to the Corporation.<br />
				  The Head Office of the Corporation  is at Mumbai. An Chief Executive Officer is in overall charge of its day-to-day  operations. It has four Departments, viz. Accounts, Deposit Insurance, Credit  Guarantee and Administration, under the supervision of other Senior Officers.  The Corporation had four branches, situated at Kolkata, Chennai, Nagpur and New  Delhi. Out of these, the branches situated at Kolkata, Chennai and Nagpur were  closed with effect from November 30, 2000, since almost all the banks have  opted out of the Credit Guarantee Schemes, and most of the pending claims have  been settled. While major items of work of these three branches were taken over  by the Head Office of the Corporation, some residual items of work are vested  with the DICGC Cells specially created in the Rural Planning &amp; Credit  Department of the Reserve Bank of India at the respective centres.</p>

Banks  covered by Deposit Insurance Scheme<br />
(I)  All commercial banks including the branches of foreign banks functioning in  India, Local Area Banks and Regional Rural Banks.<br />
(II)  Co-operative Banks - All eligible co-operative banks as defined in Section  2(gg) of the DICGC Act are covered by the Deposit Insurance Scheme. All State,  Central and Primary co-operative banks functioning in the States/Union  Territories which have amended their Co-operative Societies Act as required  under the DICGC Act, 1961, empowering RBI to order the Registrar of  Co-operative Societies of the respective States/Union Territories to wind up a  co-operative bank or to supersede its committee of management and requiring the  Registrar not to take any action for winding up, amalgamation or reconstruction  of a co-operative bank without prior sanction in writing from the RBI, are  treated as eligible banks. At present all co-operative banks, other than those  from the States of Meghalaya and the Union Territories of Chandigarh,  Lakshadweep and Dadra and Nagar Haveli are covered by the Scheme.<br />
Insurance coverage<br />
            Initially, under the provisions of  Section 16(1) of the DICGC Act, the insurance cover was limited to Rs.1,500/-  only per depositor(s) for deposits held by him (them) in the &quot;same right  and in the same capacity&quot; in all the branches of the bank taken together.  However, the Act also empowers the Corporation to raise this limit with the  prior approval of the Central Government. Accordingly, the insurance limit was  enhanced from time to time as follows:<br />
Rs. 5,000/- with effect from  1st January 1968<br />
Rs. 10,000/- with effect from 1st April 1970<br />
Rs. 20,000/- with effect from 1st January 1976<br />
Rs. 30,000/- with effect from 1st July 1980<br />
Rs. 1,00,000/- with effect from 1st May 1993 onwards.</p>
				<pre><strong>Types of Deposits Covered</strong></pre>
                <p>            DICGC insures all bank deposits,  such as saving, fixed, current, recurring, etc. except the following types of  deposits.<br />
                  (i) Deposits of foreign  Governments;<br />
                  (ii) Deposits of Central/State Governments;<br />
                  (iii) Inter-bank deposits;<br />
                  (iv) Deposits of the State Land Development Banks with the State co-operative  banks;<br />
                  (v) Any amount due on account of and deposit received outside India;<br />
                  (vi) Any amount which has been specifically exempted by the corporation with  the previous approval of the RBI.<br />
                  Insurance Premium<br />
                  The rate of insurance premium was  initially fixed at .0.05 or 1/20th of 1 per cent per annum. It was reduced to  .0.04 or 1/25th of 1 per cent per annum with effect from 1st October 1971.  However, it was again raised to .0.05 or 1/20th of 1 per cent per annum with  effect from 1st July 1993.Since 2001,the Corporation has had to settle claims  for large amounts due to the failure of banks, particularly in the Co-operative  Sector causing a drain on the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). While there is  sufficient corpus in Deposit Insurance Fund for the present, it is necessary to  build up a sound DIF in the long term to protect the interests of the banking  system. With this objective the Corporation decided to enhance the deposit  insurance premium from 5 paise per Rs.100 of assessable deposits per annum to  10 paise per Rs.100 of assessable deposits per annum in a phased manner over a  period of two years. In the first phase, the premium was raised to 8 paise per  Rs.100 of assessable deposits from the financial year 2004-05 and later to 10  paise per Rs. 100 assessable deposits from the fiancial year 2005-06. The  Corporation will continuously review the DIF and will consider revising the  premium further from time to time with the objective of maintaining a strong  DIF.For further details refer the section - What's New<br />
                  The premium paid by the insured  banks to the Corporation is required to be absorbed by the banks themselves so  that the benefit of deposit insurance protection is made available to the  depositors free of cost. In other words the financial burden on account of  payment of premium should be borne by the banks themselves and should not be  passed on to the depositors. <br />
                  The formula for working out the  half-yearly premium is as follows: -<br />
                  Deposits  in rupees rounded to thousands X 0.05 / 100<br />
                  The  deposits should be rounded off to the nearest thousand Rupees<br />
                  Interest<br />
                  An insured bank is required to remit  premium not later than the last day of May and November each year. If it does  not pay on or before the stipulated date the premium payable by it or any  portion thereof, it is liable to pay interest at the rate of 8% above the Bank  Rate on the amount of such premium or on the unpaid portion thereof, as the  case may be, from the beginning of the half-year till the date of payment.  Interest is calculated on this basis for the actual number of days of default,  taking 1 year as 365 days.<br />
                  Any  amount payable to the Corporation by way of premium or interest on the overdue  amount of premium can be paid in the following manner:</p>
               
                  <ul>
                    <li>Directly for credit of  Deposit Insurance Fund A/C of the Corporation maintained with RBI, Deposit  Accounts Department, Mumbai.</li>
                    <li>Remittance by crossed  cheque, demand draft or T.T. drawn and payable at Mumbai, in favour of the  Corporation.</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>Returns<br />
                  Every insured bank is required to  furnish to the Corporation as soon as possible, after the commencement of each  calendar half-year, but not in any event later than the last day of the first  month of the half-year, a statement (Form DI-01) in duplicate, showing the  basis on which the premium payable by that bank has been calculated and the  amount of premium payable by that bank for that half-year. The statement should  be certified as correct by two officials authorised by the bank for this  purpose and it has to furnish to the Corporation specimen signatures of the  officers authorised to sign the statements and returns under the DICGC Act,  1961. Besides half-yearly return in form DI-01, the insured banks are also  required to furnish to the Corporation, one annual return in Form DI-02 showing  the distribution of deposits according to the size of deposits as on the last  day of June every year.<br />
                  The  liquidator of a bank which has been wound up or liquidated and the chief  executive officer of the transferee bank or the insured bank as the case may be  in the case of amalgamation or reconstruction etc. sanctioned by a competent  authority, is required to submit quarterly statements in the prescribed formats  to the DICGC indicating the particulars of utilization of the amounts released  by the DICGC, the position of realisation of assets of the bank and utilization  of the amounts thereof and the assets and liabilities of the bank.<br />
                  Supervision and Inspection of Insured Banks<br />
                  The Corporation is empowered (vide  Section 35 of the DICGC Act) to have free access to the records of an insured  bank and to call for copies of such records. On Corporation's request, the RBI  is required to undertake / cause the inspection / investigation of an insured  bank.<br />
                  Settlement of claims<br />
                  In the event of the winding up or  liquidation of an insured bank, every depositor of the bank is entitled to  payment of an amount equal to his deposits held by him in the same right and in  the same capacity in all the branches of that bank put together, standing as on  the date of cancellation of registration (i.e. the date of cancellation of licence  or order for winding up or for liquidation) subject to the set off of his dues  to the bank, if any (Section 16(1) and (3) of the DICGC Act). However, the  payment to each depositor is subject to the limit of the insurance coverage  fixed from time to time.<br />
                  When a scheme of compromise or  arrangement or re-construction or amalgamation is sanctioned for a bank by a  competent authority, and the scheme does not entitle the depositors to get  credit for the full amount of the deposit on the date on which the scheme comes  into force, the Corporation pays the difference between the full amount of  deposit or the limit of insurance cover in force at the time, whichever is  less, and the amount actually received by him under the scheme. In these cases  also the amount payable to a depositor is determined in respect of all his  deposits held in the same right and in the same capacity in all the branches of  that bank put together subject to the set off of his dues to the bank, if any  (Section 16(2) and (3) of the DICGC Act).<br />
                  Under the provisions of Section  17(1) of the DICGC Act, the liquidator of an insured bank which has been wound  up or taken into liquidation has to submit to the DICGC a list showing  separately the amount of the deposit in respect of each depositor and the  amount set off, in such a manner as may be specified by the DICGC and certified  to be correct by the liquidator, within three months from the date of his  assuming charge of office. In the case of a bank for which a scheme of  amalgamation/ reconstruction, etc. has been sanctioned, similar list has to be  submitted by the chief executive officer of the concerned transferee bank or  insured bank as the case may be, within three months from the date on which the  scheme of amalgamation/reconstruction, etc. comes into effect (Section 18(1) of  the DICGC Act).<br />
                  The  DICGC is required to pay the amount payable under the provisions of the Act in  respect of the deposits of each depositor within two months from the date of  receipt of such lists. The time-limit is, however, subject to all the  information/documents as required by the Corporation being in order.<br />
                  On the receipt of an order for the  liquidation of a bank or a scheme of amalgamation/reconstruction etc. for a  bank approved by a competent authority, the Corporation sends detailed  guidelines for compilation of the claim list to the liquidator/chief executive  officer of the transferee or insured bank, as the case may be. Besides, copies  of the audited balance sheet and the profit and loss accounts of the bank as on  the date of cancellation of registration i.e. the date of cancellation of  licence /liquidation/amalgamation /reconstruction etc. of the bank are called  for, to verify the authenticity of the total deposits as given in the claim  list. A check list relating to the discrepancies commonly observed in the  course of scrutiny of the claim lists is given in the Annexure.<br />
                  The DICGC makes the payment of the  eligible amount to the liquidator/chief executive officer of the transferee /  insured bank, for disbursement to the depositors. No payment is made directly  to the depositors. However, the amounts payable to the untraceable depositors  i.e. those in respect of whom necessary information is not available, are held  back till the liquidator/chief executive officer is in a position to furnish  all the requisite particulars.<br />
                  In  terms of Section 21(2) of the DICGC Act read with Regulation 22 of the DICGC  General Regulations, the liquidator or the insured bank or the transferee bank  as the case may be, is required to repay the amount to the DICGC within such a  time and in such a manner as may be prescribed, out of the amounts realised  from the assets of the failed bank and other amounts in hand after making  provision for the expenses incurred, as soon as such amounts are sufficient to  pay to each depositor one paisa or more in the Rupee.<br />
