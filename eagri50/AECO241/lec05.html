				<p align="right"><img src="images/back.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="30" usemap="#Map" />
                  <map name="Map" id="Map2">
                    <area shape="rect" coords="1,1,168,30" href="index.html" alt="" />

				<p align="justify">Finance in agriculture is as important as other inputs being used  in agricultural production. Technical inputs can be purchased  and used by farmer only if he has money (funds). But his own money is always  inadequate and  he needs outside finance or credit. Professional money lenders  were the only source of credit to agriculture till 1935.  They used to charge unduly high rates of  interest and follow serious practices while giving loans and recovering them.  As a result, farmers were heavily burdened with debts and many of them  perpetuated debts. With the passing of Reserve Bank of India Act 1934, District  Central Co-op. Banks Act and Land Development Banks Act, agricultural credit  received impetus and there were improvements in agricultural credit. A powerful  alternative agency came into being. Large-scale credit became available with  reasonable rates of interest at easy terms, both in terms of granting loans and  recovery of them. Although the co-operative banks started financing agriculture  with their establishments in 1930’s real impetus was received only after  Independence when suitable legislation were passed and policies were  formulated. Thereafter, bank credit to agriculture made phenomenal progress by  opening branches in rural areas and attracting deposits.<br />
            <br />
Till 14 major  commercial banks were nationalized in 1969, co-operative banks were the main  institutional agencies providing finance to agriculture. After nationalization,  it was made mandatory for these banks to provide finance to agriculture as a  priority sector. These banks undertook special programs of branch expansion and  created a network of banking services throughout the country and started  financing agriculture on large scale. Thus agriculture credit acquired  multi-agency dimension. Development and adoption of new technologies and  availability of finance go hand in hand. In bringing &quot;Green  Revolution&quot;, &quot;White Revolution&quot; and &quot;Yellow  Revolution&quot; finance has played a crucial role. Now the agriculture credit,  through multi agency approach has come to stay.<br />
            <br />
The procedures  and amount of loans for various purposes have been standardized. Among the  various purposes &quot;Crop loans&quot; (Short-term loan) has the major share.  In addition, farmers get loans for purchase of electric motor with pump,  tractor and other machinery, digging wells or boring wells, installation of  pipe lines, drip irrigation, planting fruit orchards, purchase of dairy animals  and feeds/fodder for them, poultry, sheep/goat keeping and for many other  allied enterprises.<br />
</p>
				<p><strong>Agricultural  Credit System in India: </strong>Farmers get external financial  assistance from two sources namely, i) non-institutional or unorganized  agencies, and ii) institutional or organized agencies. It is a fact that  agriculture has been financed by non-institutional agencies for a long time and  institutional agencies were started functioning only during the early part of  this century.<br />
				  <br />
                  <strong>Non-Institutional  Sources of Finance in India</strong><br />
			    Non-institutional  sources include money lenders, land lords, traders, commission agents, friends  and relatives.</p>
				<blockquote>
				  <p><strong>i)  Money Lenders</strong>: There are two types of money lenders  in rural areas. a) agricultural money lenders and b) professional money lender.  Agricultural money lender's main occupation is farming and money lending is  secondary one. Professional money lender's main profession is money lending.  Although the reliance on money lender by rural poor declined over the years,  the credit disbursed by money lenders still forms a major portion of the total  credit obtained by the farmers.<br />
				    <br />
				    Agricultural money lender's main  occupation is farming and money lending is secondary one while the Professional  money lender's main profession is money lending. Although the reliance on  agricultural and professional money lenders by rural poor declined over the  years, i.e., from 80 per cent of their total credit requirement in 1951 to 30  per cent in 2002, the credit disbursed by money lenders still forms a major  portion of the total credit obtained by the farmers.<br />
                                  </p>
			    </blockquote>
				<p><strong>Advantages</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Unrestricted supply of  credit for any purpose..</li>
				  <li>Easy access by farmers as  money lenders maintain close relationship with rural families.</li>
				  <li>Method of business adopted  are simple and flexible.</li>
				  <li>Timely availability of  credit without much formalities.</li>
				  <li>Knowledge on local conditions  and experience of money lender facilitate his business.</li>
				  <li>Money lenders do not insist  upon any particular type of security for the grant of loans.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Unfair  Practices of Money Lenders: </strong> Money lenders deceive the farmers  through many ways such as:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>They  manipulate bonds and promissory notes obtained from debtors and enter large sum  than actually lent.</li>
				  <li>They  give no receipt for repayments and often they deny such repayments.</li>
				  <li>They  charge very high rate of interest</li>
				  <li>They  give loans for both  productive and unproductive  purposes which results in indebtedness</li>
			    </ul>

  <strong>ii)  Land Lords</strong><br />
				  Small farmers and tenants rely on  land lords for finance to meet out their productive and unproductive expenses.  This source of finance has all the defects associated with money lenders.  Interest rates are exorbitant. Often small farmers are forced to sell out their  lands to these   land lords and they  become land less labourers. Landless labourers bonded labourers. The reliance  on this agency by farmers has been decreased over years, i.e., from 1.5 per  cent in 1951 to 1.0 per cent in 2002. <br />
				  <br />
  <strong>iii)  Traders and Commission Agents</strong><br />
				  They are functioning either to get  regular supply of products for their trade or to have a control over the provision  of credit by other creditors. Though the rate of interest charged by them is  not as high as charged by the money lenders, they charge more in the form of  concessions and service chages, They mostly finance for the cultivation of  commercial crops like sugarcane, cotton, ground-nut, tobacco, onion, etc. The  share of credit provided by these agencies to total credit decreased from 5.5  per cent in 1951 to 2.5 per cent in 2002.<br />
				  <br />
  <strong>iv)  Relatives</strong> <br />
				  Farmers borrow from their  relatives for temporary exigencies. It is  simply a mutual help. Since all farmers are living under similar conditions,  they can not lend large sums as loans. Normally, no interest is paid on such  loans. Although, the private agencies satisfied some of the criteria of a good  system of credit,their loan were not related to production purposes, they never  cared for the end use of the loan extended and the loan is often used for  wasteful purposes.  However, institutions  adopt a productive and  purpose oriented  credit policy while providing credit. So this policy made the institutions to  discourage the provision of credit to consumption purpose. But it is evident  that the need for consumption loan in rural households continues to persist. As  the institutions deny consumption loans to farmer's, the non-institutional  agency continues to dominate the rural credit system. Moreover, the  institutional agencies could not provide more than 60-65 per cent of the total  credit needs of the farmers. Therefore, the private credit agencies should be  brought under a more realistic system of state regulation. Otherwise, the rural  people would continue to suffer from indebtedness in spite of various efforts  taken by the government to uplift their economic conditions. Their share has  declined from 14.2 per cent in 1951 to 7.1 per cent in 2002.<br />
				  <br />
  <strong>Institutional  Credit Agencies: </strong>As compared to the quantum of credit  requirement and the capacity of institutions to meet these credit demands under  multiagency system, it is impossible to completely wipe out the private  agencies from the rural scene. The Banking committee, (1931) and the Banking  Commission (1972) offered suggestions toget over the evil aspects of private  lending agencies and bring them under sound credit system.These suggestions may  be adopted till the institutional agencies attain the capacity to meet the full  demand for credit. <br />
				  The major institutions  supplying credit to agricultural sector are :  i) Government, ii) Co-operatives, iii) Commercial Banks, iv) Regional Rural  Banks, v) Reserve Bank of India (National Bank for Agricultural and Rural  Development) <br />
				  <br />
                  <strong>i)  Government </strong>The Government provides both direct and  indirect finance to farming sector.<br />
                  <strong>Direct  Finance </strong>The government provides taccavi loans in  times of distress like famine, flood, drought etc. Land Improvement Act of 1883  and the Agriculturists Loans Act of 1984 were enacted to extend long and short  term financial assistance to farmers for agricultural development and also an  relief measures during distress times.<br />
                  <strong>Merits</strong><br />
				  1. They are granted  for long period of time.<br />
				  2. Low interest is  charged.<br />
				  3. The repayment plan  is convenient, i.e., repayment in equal annual installments.<br />
                  <strong>Demerits</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Quantum  of loan is determined an the basis of value of security offered, by which,  large farmers receive more credit than small and marginal farmers.</li>
				  <li>As  these loans are not production oriented, they do not satisfy the standard  needed for sound system of form credit.</li>
				  <li>The  loan amount is inadequate.</li>
				  <li>The  land less labourers were left  out in the  lurch at the time of distress.</li>
				  <li>The  taccavi loans are not popular among farmers due to inordinate delay in  sanctioning of loan. </li>
		        </ul>
				<ul><li>imposition of irrelevant  conditions.</li>
				  <li>incompetent supervision</li>
				  <li>in convenient recovery  methods.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>In view of these  demerits, it was recommended to channalise these loans through co-operatives.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Indirect Finance to  Agriculture by Government</strong></li>
				  <li>It  allocates subsidized fertilizer to states according to their needs.</li>
				  <li>It  provides technical assistance to farmers through Tamil Nadu agricultural  Development Programme.</li>
				  <li>It  implements price stabilization schemes for various crops.</li>
				  <li>In  consultation with the RBI, the government prescribes the rates of interest to  be charged on loans granted to weaker sections of rural areas.</li>
				  <li>It  contributes to the share capital and debentures of co-operatives.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Instead of playing  direct role in providing form credit, the government may play a vital role in  creating conditions or infra-structural facilities to the promotion of  institutional credit.</p>
