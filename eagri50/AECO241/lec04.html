				<p align="left"><strong>4RS, 5CS AND 7PS OF CREDIT,  REPAYMENT PLANS</strong><br />
				  The principles of farm finance are  stated as ‘three Cs’, viz,<br />
				  1)  Character<br />
				  2)  Capacity, and<br />
				  3)  Capital.<br />
				  The  application of these principles facilitate largely the lending agencies, in the  sense that the character of the borrower is a dominant factor for consideration  before a lending agency decides to advance loan. Although the farm more net  income, create good finance extended to a farmer may yield repaying capacity  and buildup risk bearing  ability he will  not repay the loan unless he has good character. The second principle deals  with the capacity of the borrower who not only produce more but also has to  repay the loan in time. The third principle is intended to safeguard the  interest of the lending agency. When the first two intangible assets prove  inadequate during distress periods, the third, asset or capital will come to  the rescue of the lending agency.<br />
				  The principles of farm credit can also  be stated as ‘three Rs'.  They are:<br />
				  i)  Returns from the proposed investment,<br />
				  ii)  Repaying capacity<br />
				  iii)  Risk-bearing ability of the borrower<br />
				  To  find out the feasibility of a project or a scheme or a farm plan, these  principles can the applied as economic feasibility tests.<br />
  <strong>i)  Returns</strong> <br />
				  The  economic viability of a project indicates whether the proposed project is  likely to contribute reasonable returns on the investment which in turn will  lead to economic development of the farmer.<br />
				  The economic viability can be measured  by<br />
				  1)  Net Present Worth (NPW)<br />
				  2)  Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR)<br />
				  3)  Internal Rate of Return (IRR)<br />
  <strong>1. </strong><strong>Net Present Worth</strong><br />
				  The  NPW of the project can be estimated using formula as given below:<br />
  <img width="135" height="37" src="lec04_clip_image002.gif" /> </p>
				<p>Where,<br />
                        Bn  = Benefits in n'th Year.<br />
                        Cn  = Costs in n'th Year.<br />
                        n = life span of the proect<br />
                        i  = interest or discount rate.<br />
If the NPW of a project is positive,  then it is considered that the project is economically feasible.</p>
				<p><strong>2.  Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR)</strong><br />
				  The BCR can be calculated using the  following formula: <br />
				  <img width="130" height="82" src="lec04_clip_image002_0000.gif" /></p>
				<p>To compute the NPW and BCR, the  opportunity cost of capital (normal/market lending rate) may be used as a  discount rate.  If the BCR is greater  than 1, then it is worth wile to invest on the project.</p>
				<p>                        <img width="167" height="43" src="lec04_clip_image004.gif" /><br />
				  IRR is that rate of discount which makes  the present worth of benefits and costs equal or the net present worth of cash  flow equal to zero. If IRR is greater than the opportunity cost of capital, the  project is feasible.<br />
  <strong>ii) </strong><strong>Repaying  capacity</strong><br />
				  The  repayment of loan depends on the amount of surplus income available with the  farm household after providing some amount for the family expenses and  pre-existing liabilities, besides keeping a margin for the risk factor. As the  farming family is likely to get income from the farm business as well as from  off-farm activities, the repaying capacity of the borrower should be judged by  taking into account their total income.<br />
				  The concept of repaying capacity can be  expressed symbolically as: <br />
				  Rc  = ( (Y2-rf) + (Y1-rf) + Y) - ( (X2-X1) +  Fe+OL)) ³  I+i<br />
				  Where,<br />
				  Rc        = Repaying capacity<br />
				  Y           = Income from other sources.<br />
				  Fe        = Family expenses<br />
				  OL       = Other liabilities<br />
				  rf          = risk factor margin<br />
				  I            = Loan installment<br />
			    i = interest on  investment and working capital.</p>
				<p>If the surplus is greater than or equal  to loan installment plus interest, the borrower may be judged as having the  capacity to repay the loan. If the surplus is more, the repayment period of  loan may be reduced and it is less than (I+i) either the period for the  repayment of loan may be extended or the project can be modified.<br />
                    <strong>iii)  Risk Bearing Ability</strong><br />
				  The  beneficiaries of the project should have risk bearing ability (for repaying the  loan amount promptly), ie., they should withstand the shocks of probable  financial losses irrespective of the fact that the project appraisal has taken  care of all precautions to prevent such losses. While the technical feasibility  test reveals the productivity of the investment, the economic viability test  indicated the returns to the investment. How far the beneficiaries of the  project are having the capacity to repay the loan promptly is revealed by  repaying capacity test.  However, the  farm income is subject to variations and it is essential to account for this  variations in farm income. The output and price are the factors which determine  the farm income fluctuations in output may be due to:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Natural  causes like floods, droughts, pests and diseases etc.</li>
				  <li>Technical  causes like break down of machinery, non-availability of inputs, availability  of defective inputs etc.</li>
				  <li>Social  causes like theft, labour strike etc.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>            Fluctuation  in prices is due to demand and supply factors besides lack of storage,  transport and communication facilities, failure of government to  control/regulate prices etc. The variation in farm income over a period of  years is measured by coefficient of variation. The coefficient of variation is  measured by the formula:</p>
				<p>                        <img width="178" height="34" src="lec04_clip_image006.gif" /></p>
				<p>Where,<br />
				  Standard Deviation (SD)  = <img width="110" height="62" src="lec04_clip_image008.gif" /></p>

				<p>Since the coefficient of variation is 34  percent for this farm, to determine the repaying capacity of the farmer, the  gross income should be deflated by 34 percent. Suppose, if the farm income is  Rs.10,000 and the coefficient of variation is 34 per cent, the real farm income  is Rs.6,600 only.<br />
                    <strong>7 Ps</strong><br />
				  The  modern rural financing institutions have to follow principles of farm finance  not only to achieve commercial gains but also to bring about social benefits.  By the combination of principles of economics, banking and farm management  along with the existing principles, the following principles of farm finance  have been evolved, on the basis of the definition adopted for the concept of  farm finance for development:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Principle  of Productive Purpose,</li>
				  <li>Principle  of Personality,</li>
				  <li>Principle  of Productivity,</li>
				  <li>Principle  of Phased disbursement,</li>
				  <li>Principle  of Proper utilization,</li>
				  <li>Principle  of repayment, and</li>
				  <li>Principle  of protection</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>1.  Principle of Productive Purpose</strong><br />
				  While  there is encouragement for production finance, consumption credit is  discouraged at all levels. The CRAFICARD (1981) recommended consumption credit  if it is meant to increase family labour productivity. Only the unproductive  consumption credit needs such as loan for litigation, social functions, etc.,  of the farmers may be excluded from the purview of farm finance. The resource  being scarce even for productive purposes, the most important and indispensable  purpose should be served first. Though a scheme may be technically feasible,  the economic viability, repaying capacity and risk bearing ability of the  farmer should also be taken into consideration before accepting the scheme.  Therefore, even among the productive purposes, the most important one like  sinking of well or installation of pumpset may be considered on a priority  basis for providing finance.<br />
  <strong>2.  Principle of personality</strong><br />
				  This  emphasizes that the criteria to extend farm finance is not only credit  worthiness, but also trust-worthiness of the borrower. The farmer should be a  man of character having entrepreneurship, capable of keeping up his promises,  agreeable to adopt modern technology in farming and inclined to co-operate with  the financing institutions in all aspects.   One of the reasons attributed for the mounting overdues is the willful  default of the borrowers, majority of whom are credit worthy-affluent farmers.<br />
  <strong>3.  Principle of Productivity</strong><br />
				  In  short, productivity can be defined as output per unit of input. Farm finance is  used by a farmer to increase the 'marginal efficiency of capital' which is a  ratio between increase in expected future returns of the investment and  increase in the cost of investment. Farm finance aims not only at mere  production, but also intends to increase the productivity of farm resources, viz., land, labour, capital and  management.  Apart from productive  purpose for which the loan is disbursed and good character as emphasized under  principle of personality, the economic returns that would be generated by the  scheme is also very important. The economic viability of the scheme is measured  by Benefit-cost ratio, Internal Rate of Return and Net Present Worth.<br />
  <strong>4.  Principle of phased disbursement</strong><br />
				  The  finance should be disbursed not only in time but also in a phased manner,  because no project needs the entire finance at the initial stage itself. Phased  disbursement enables the borrower to make use of the finance far the purpose  far which it is granted and aids the financing institution to ensure the  end-use of it. Disbursement has three facets, viz., i) disbursement in cash, ii)  disbursement in kind and iii) disbursement to suppliers of inputs  directly. The institution itself may supply the needed inputs such as seeds,  fertilizers, pesticides, etc., to the farmers as is being done by  co-operatives. A portion of the finance may also be disbursed to the farmer in  cash to meet out labour expenses. In case of machinery the institution may  directly make payments to the suppliers after receiving the margin money from  the borrowers.<br />
  <strong>5.  Principle of Proper Utilization</strong><br />
				  The  finance so extended to a farmer should be utilized far the purpose far which it  is granted. The finance should be put into optimum use through backward and  forward linkages which need basic infrastructure and supervision. When finance  is provided for the cultivation of crops, inputs like seeds, fertilizers,  pesticides, labour, etc., must be made available to him in time. Apart from  technical guidance for production, marketing facilities will help him to  realise mare returns. Farmers also divert the finance to meet their urgent  needs, as a result they could not generate adequate returns for loan repayment.  Thus, proper appraisal of the overall financial needs of the farmer and  adoption of supervisory credit system in farm financing operations will bring  the desired results.<br />
  <strong>6.  Principle of payment</strong><br />
				  This  helps to draw proper repayment schedule and emphasizes how and when the finance  extended to the farmer should be repaid. Unrealistic repayment plan makes the  farmer become a defaulter, even though he may have good repaying capacity.  The repayment schedule should synchronize  with the time of generation of income from the project. The repayment should be  drawn in such a way that the principle and interest can be repaid out of the  incremental income generated from the project, after setting aside a portion to  meet his family expenses.<br />
  <strong>7.  Principle of protection</strong><br />
				  This  emphasis that all possible precautions should be taken to safeguard the funds  which the financing institutions lend to the farmers. Some of the safety  measures taken are:<br />
  <strong>i)  Insurance cover</strong><br />
				  Insurance cover is available for  machines, animal husbandry projects and crops to some extent.<br />
  <strong>ii)  Linking credit with marketing</strong></p>
				<p>Linking credit with marketing enables  the financing institutions to ensure the end use of credit and to receive repayments regularly. A few examples  are given below to indicate agencies with whom marketing arrangements can be  made.</p>

                    </tr>
                  </table>
			    </div>
				<p><strong>iii)  Provision of infrastructure</strong><br />
				  One  of the factors for the success of farm  finance is the availability of infrastructural facilities like input supply,  storage facilities, transport and communication facilities, good marketing  system, availability of technical  guidance, etc.<br />
  <strong>iv)  Covering credit under small Loans Guarantee Scheme of DI and CGC</strong><br />
				  The  loans extended to the weaker sections can be covered under small Loans  Guarantee Scheme of Deposit Insurance and credit Guarantee  Corporation (DI and CGC).<br />
  <strong>v)  Taking Securities</strong><br />
				  Neither  the secured loans are invariably repaid, nor the unsecured loans completely  remain unpaid. However, as a  measure of caution, the loans maybe secured by mortgage / hypothecation of  assets. But no project need be rejected merely for want of security, if it is  considered feasible. <br />
				  Knowledge  of these principles enables the lending agencies to arrive at a correct  judgment of the project/ scheme, to assess the financial requirements of the  farmers, to determine the risk involved in such financing and to evaluate the  extent of benefit that accrues to the farmers.</p>
