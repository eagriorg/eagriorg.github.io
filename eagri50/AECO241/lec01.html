				<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Farm finance has become an important  input due to the advent of capital intensive agricu1tural technologies. Farmers  require capital in order to enhance the productivities of various farm  resources. Indian agriculture, in general, is characterized by low and  uncertain returns. In order to break the vicious cycle of low returns → low  savings → low investment → low returns, provision of external finance to  farmers becomes inevitable.</p>
				<p align="justify">Organized and unorganized credit  agencies in rural area provide credit for both development and consumption  purposes. Provision of credit by these agencies involved many obstacles to both  bankers and  borrowers due to differences  in banking system followed by bankers, socio-economic conditions of borrowers  and infra - structural facilities and institutional support offered to the  borrowers. Besides, the government also frequently changes its agricultural  credit policies regarding institutional credit set-up, credit rationing, rates  of interest, subsidy and the functioning of markets and other developmental  agencies which would influence the extent of credit available to  farmer-borrower. All these factors, therefore, ultimately have a bearing on  farm returns. Hence, problems regarding  capital could be well understoood, if one could realise the theoretical basis  of agricultural credit system in India, bottlenecks faced by bankers and  borrowers, and the governments' efforts in solving the problems involved in the  agricultural credit system in India.</p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Importance  of Agricultural Finance: </strong>Credit is essential for agricultural  development and also for the development of the economy as a whole. The  agricultural finance is required for the following reasons:</p>
				<blockquote>
				  <p align="justify">i) The scope for  extensive agriculture in India is limited. Therefore, increase in agricultural  production is possible only by intensification and diversification of farming.  Intensive agriculture needs huge capita1.</p>
				  <p align="justify">ii) Extreme  inequalities exist in the distribution of   operational holdings and operational area. 74.5 per cent of  the   total  number of farm households  which own less than 2 hectares operate only 26.2 per cent of the total operated  area whereas only 2.4 per cent of total number of farm households which own  more than 10 hectares each operate 23 percent of the total operated area in  1980-81 (In India, there were 88.883 million farm households which operated  163.797 million hectares in 1980-81). The purchasing power of these small and  marginal farmers is limited to their subsistence farming. Hence, they have to  depend on the external financial assistance to use the costlier (modern)  inputs.</p>
				  <p align="justify">iii) Farmers economic  condition is subject to frequent onslaught of flood, drought, famine etc.  Therefore, either the continuance of cultivation of crops or making  improvements on the farms depends on the nature and availability of finance. </p>
				  <p align="justify">iv) In recent years,  more area is brought under irrigation which in turn would increase the use of  inputs like fertilizer and plant protection chemicals. In order to accomplish  this, external finance is needed. </p>
				  <p align="justify">v) In order to  sustain the development of agro-based industries, there should be a substantial  increase in the supply of raw materials needed for such industries. Therefore,  for the development of farm sector, a constant flow of credit is essential and  it would enhance over all growth of the economy. </p>
				  <p align="justify">vi) In agriculture,  fixed capital is locked up in permanent investments like land, well, buildings,  etc. Moreover, it takes a long time to get returns from farm. Hence, farmers  need finance to continue their farm operations.<br />
				    vii) The weaker  sections of the farming community should be motivated to participate in  development programmes by giving financial assistance to acquire productive  assets.</p>
				  <p align="justify">viii) Small and  marginal farmer’s are trapped in the vicious cycle of poverty i.e., low returns  → low saving → low investment → low return. To break this cycle, credit has to  be injected in agricultural sector.</p>
			    </blockquote>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Differences  between Financing of Agricultural and Other Sectors: </strong>Financing agriculture requires a  thorough understanding of farming conditions as it is different from lending to  other sectors. The important factors which differentiate farm finance from  other lending are as follows:</p>
