				<p>Bacterial  genetics is the study of gene structure and function in bacteria. Genetics  itself is concerned with determining the number, location, and character of the  genes of an organism. The process of replication is essential to understand in  or manipulate the genome and to understand the functioning of these organisms.                                  <br />
                  <strong>DNA REPLICATION</strong><br />
In general, DNA is replicated by uncoiling of the helix, strand separation by  breaking of the hydrogen bonds between the complementary strands, and synthesis  of two new strands by complementary base pairing. Replication begins at  a specific site in the DNA called the origin  of replication. </p>

                  Transcription is the process by which  genetic information from DNA is transferred into RNA. DNA sequence is  enzymatically copied by RNA polymerase to produce a complementary nucleotide  RNA strand. One significant difference between RNA and DNA sequence is the  presence of U, or uracil in RNA instead of the T, or thymine of DNA. In the  case of protein-encoding DNA, transcription is the first step that ultimately  leads to the translation of the genetic code, via the mRNA intermediate, into a  functional peptide or protein. The stretch of DNA that is transcribed into an  RNA molecule is called a transcription unit. A transcription unit that is  translated into protein contains sequence that directs and regulates protein  synthesis in addition to coding sequence that is translated into protein.  Regulatory sequence that is before, or 5', of the coding sequence is called 5'  untranslated (5'UTR) sequence, and sequence found following, or 3', of the  coding sequence is called 3' untranslated (3'UTR) sequence. As in DNA  replication, transcription proceeds in the 5' → 3' direction. The DNA template strand is  read 3' → 5' by RNA polymerase and the new RNA strand is synthesized in  the 5'→ 3' direction. RNA polymerase  binds to the 3' end of a gene (promoter) on the DNA template strand and travels  toward the 5' end. Except for the fact that thymines in DNA are converted to  uracils in RNA, the newly synthesized RNA strand will have the same sequence as  the coding (non-template) strand of the DNA.</p>

                <p><strong>How to  undertake experiments for understanding genetics of bacteria ?</strong><br />
                  The classical way to investigate genes is to mate two  organisms with different genotypes and compare the observable properties  (phenotypes) of the parents with those of the progeny. Bacteria do not mate (in  the usual way), so there is no way of getting all the chromosomes of two  different bacteria into the same cell. However, there are a number of ways in  which a part of the chromosome or genome from one <a name="&amp;lid=ALINK" id="&amp;lid=ALINK">bacterium</a> can be inserted into another bacterium so that the outcome can be studied. <br />
                  The first step in performing genetic  research on bacteria is to select mutants that differ from wild-type cells in  one or more genes. Then crosses are made between mutants and wild types, or  between two different mutants, to determine dominance-recessive relationships,  chromosomal location, and other properties. Various genetic methods are used to  select bacterial mutants, antibiotic-resistant cells, cells with specific  growth requirements, and so on.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Mutants  in bacteria are mostly biochemical in nature, because we can’t generally see  the cells.</li>
                  <li>The  most important mutants are auxotrophs.   An auxotroph needs some nutrient that the wild type strain (prototroph)  can make for itself.  For example, a trp-  auxotroph can’t make its own tryptophan (an amino acid).  To grow trp- bacteria, you need to add  tryptophan to the growth medium.   Prototrophs are trp+; they don’t need any tryptophan supplied since they  make their own.  </li>
                  <li>Chemoauxotrophs  are mutants that can’t use some nutrient (usually a sugar) that prototrophs can  use as food. For example, lac- mutants can’t grow on lactose (milk sugar), but  lac+ prototrophs can grow on lactose.</li>
                  <li>Resistance  mutants confer resistance to some environmental toxin: drugs, heavy metals,  bacteriophages, etc. For instance, AmpR   causes bacteria to be resistant to ampicillin, a common antibiotic  related to penicillin.</li>
                  <li>Auxotrophs  and chemoauxotrophs are usually recessive; drug resistance mutants are usually  dominant. A common way to find bacterial mutants is replica plating, which  means making two identical copies of the colonies on a petri plate under  different conditions.</li>
                  <li>For  instance, if you were looking for trp- auxotrophs, one plate would contain  added tryptophan and the other plate would not have any tryptophan in it.  </li>
                  <li>Bacteria  are first spread on the permissive plate, the plate that allows both mutants  and wild type to grow, the plate containing tryptophan in this case.  They are allowed to grow fro a while, then a  copy of the plate is made by pressing a piece of velvet onto the surface of the  plate, then moving it to a fresh plate with the restrictive condition (no  tryptophan).  The velvet transfers some  cells from each colony to an identical position on the restrictive plate.</li>
                  <li>Colonies  that grow on the permissive plate but not the restrictive plate are (probably)  trp- auxotrophs, because they can only grow if tryptophan is supplied. </li>
                </ol>
