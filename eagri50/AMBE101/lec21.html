				<ol>
				  <li>Microbes  are nature's decomposers. The variety of metabolic abilities in microbes is  enormous, and includes microbes that can degrade or mitigate all sorts of human  products and activities, from oil spills to pesticide runoff to toxic waste.</li>
				  <li>Environmental  Microbiology seeks to find ways to maximize the efficiency of microbes in  helping to remove various kinds of wastes (e.g. sewage treatment), or to  minimize the opportunities of microbes to produce problems (e.g. water treatment).</li>
				  <li>Environmental  Microbiology is a growing field, often brings together issues of concern to  engineers, geologists and hydrologists, microbiologists, and public health  officials.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>Sewage Treatment </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Until  1900's, human wastes were simply dumped as raw sewage into the nearest  outhouse, stream, or river. As connection of sewage to diseases such as cholera  became clear, public policy changed to required water treatment. This had major  impact on reduction of many diseases. </li>
				  <li>Sewage  = mix of domestic + industrial waste plus drainage water from rainfall.  Contains many microbes, mostly harmless but some pathogens from humans or  animals. Can include bacteria such as Vibrio  cholera, Shigella dysenteriae,  enteropathogenic strains of E. coli  and B. cereus, viruses such as  Hepatitis A, many more.</li>
				  <li>Sewage treatment: goal is to get rid of pathogens, also reduce  organic content of effluent to a low level.</li>
				  <li>Primary wastewater treatment: use screens to remove large objects (plastic bags,  wads of paper, etc.), then move water to large tank to allow settling of  heavier particulate matter as sludge.</li>
				  <li>Secondary wastewater treatment: modern facilities use &quot;activated sludge  process&quot;. After moving water from primary settling tank, bubble air  through a secondary tank. Aerobic microbes grow and break down organic matter  in the tank. Then move water to another tank called the secondary clarifier, where solids settle and are added to sludge.  Clarified liquid is treated with chlorine to kill remaining microbes, then  discharged as clear liquid into nearest river. Anaerobic bacteria break down  organic matter, produce lots of fermentation products. Methanogens grow on  these wastes and produce methane gas as waste. This can be trapped and used as  fuel (useful in developing countries).</li>
				  <li>Tertiary wastewater treatment: Secondary wastewater treatment does not remove  inorganic ions, such as NH3, PO4-3, SO4-2.  Wastewater can enrich local waters to create eutrophic conditions, including  algal blooms and sufficient loss of oxygen that fish die. To prevent this, a  few water treatment systems use additional steps to remove ammonia and  phosphate, using additional processing tanks in which specific bacteria are  used to remove ammonia and phosphate.</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>Bioremediation </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Expanded  use of chemicals in industry has produced major new problems of environmental  pollution. U.S. alone has over 50,000 hazardous waste sites. Entire communities  have been evacuated because of accumulated toxic wastes. Groundwaters are often  polluted as well, including toxic chemicals such as commercial solvents used to  degrease machinery or in &quot;dry cleaning&quot;. Fertilizers and pesticides  are often found in water downstream from agriculture.</li>
				  <li>Bioremediation = use of living organisms to promote destruction  of environmental pollutants. See example of anaerobic toluene degrader .</li>
				  <li>Typically,  native microbes are used (rather than introduced or genetically mofified  organisms). Rather than waiting for &quot;nature to take its course&quot;, try  to speed up the process. How?</li>
				  <li>&quot;Pump and treat&quot;. One way to speed  bioremediation. Pump groundwater to surface, add nutrients (e.g., O2,  methane), reinject into contaminated zone. In some cases, can inject</li>
				  <li>Bioreactor. Another technique. Put contaminated soil or groundwater into an  industrial-sized fermentor, add appropriate microbes to degrade materials, keep  adding more substrate over time. This works well for very toxic chemicals such  as chlorinated compounds (PCBs).</li>
				  <li>Microbiology  of water</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>Drinking water is  obtained either from surface sources such as rivers, lakes or from underground  water. Such natural waters are likely to be polluted with domestic and  industrial wastes. Although water purification systems envisage protection from  pollution, sometimes, the water supply can become a potential carrier of  pathogenic organisms and endanger public health. A number of diseases such as  cholera, typhoid, viral hepatitis etc., are known to be water borne. These  pathogens are commonly transmitted through drinking water and cause infection  of the intestinal tract. It is therefore, necessary to employ treatment  facilities to purify water and to provide safe drinking water (Potable water).<br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Water that is free from diseases producing  organism and chemical substances deleterious to health is called potable water<br />
				  The  main operations employed in water purification to produce potable water are:  (i) sedimentation, (ii) filtration, and (iii) chlorination (fig 1).  Sedimentation removes large particulate matter which settles at the bottomMost  microorganisms are removed during coagulation with aluminium sulphate and sand  filtration and subsequent treatment of water with chlorine (0.2 – 2 mg free  chlorine per liter) will ensure its potability.<br />

				<p><strong>Microbiological Quality: </strong>Water can be perfectly clear in appearance  and free from odour and taste and yet, be contaminated by microorganisms.  Pathogenic organisms enter into water through sewage contamination or  discharges from animals or humans into the reservoirs. The coliforms (E.coli  and related organisms), <em>Streptococcus  faecalis</em> and <em>Clostridium perfringens</em><strong> </strong>which are normal inhabitants of the  large intestine of animals and humans enter water supplies through faecal  contamination. The presence of any of these bacterial species in water is  evidence of sewage or faecal pollution. Techniques are available by which the  presence of these specific groups can be easily identified. The routine  bacteriological examination contains consists of (i) Plate count to determine  the number of bacteria present, and (ii) biochemical test to reveal the presence  of coliform bacteria since these are indicator organisms for fecal  contamination. Figure 2 shows a general laboratory testing scheme for detection  of cliform group of bacteria in water.<br />
          A  variety of other bacteria and organisms which may not be serious pathogens  including faecal streptococci, slime forming bacteria, Sulphur bacteria, algae  etc. may also cause problems of odour, color and taste and it is essential that  be eliminated from the drinking water.<br />
