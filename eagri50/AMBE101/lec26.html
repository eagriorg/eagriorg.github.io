				<p>The intensive use of pesticides in  agriculture is a cause of serious concern. The problem is especially serious  because of the development of resistance to pesticides in important pests and  the presence of pesticide residue in agricultural and dairy products. In India,  the most serious problem of resistance is witnessed in cotton, for which  American bollworm is a serious pest. The bollworm has developed resistance to  almost all pesticides in a number of regions and is serious problem in many  states. Other important pests of cotton, white fly and jassid, have also  developed pesticide resistance in some places. Growing pesticide resistance has  meant that a large proportion of agricultural production is lost to pests.  Pesticide resistance has mainly been caused by excessive and indiscriminate use  of pesticides. Pesticides of spurious quality, which are commonly sold in small  towns and villages, have also contributed to resistance in many areas.  <br />
   Excessive  use of chemical pesticides in agriculture is a serious cause of concern. It is,  therefore, important that alternative, environmental friendly methods of plant  protection are adopted such as integrated pest management (IPM) techniques,  including the use of biopesticides.<br />
Biopesticides are an important group of pesticides that  can reduce pesticide risks. They are derived from animals, plants and  microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses. The advantages of biopesticides  are:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>They  are inherently less harmful than chemical pesticides.</li>
				  <li>They,  in general, have a narrow target range and a very specific mode of action.</li>
				  <li>They  are often effective in small quantities. Also, they decompose quickly and do  not leave problematic residues. </li>
				  <li>They are safer  to humans and the environment than conventional pesticides. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Biopesticides is a broad term and includes  bioinsecticides, biofungicides, bioherbicides and bionematicides.  Microorganisms belonging to different groups like bacteria, fungi ans viruses  are used as biopesticides. You will learn about these three groups of organisms  in following text.<strong></strong><br />
                    <strong>Bacterial</strong><br />
				  Bacteria belonging to genus <em>Bacillus </em>are potent against many insect pests. They suppress pests  by producing a toxin specific to the pest; causing a  disease; preventing establishment of other microorganisms through competition;  or other modes of action. <br />
				  An example of a bacterial pesticide is <em>Bacillus thuringiensis,</em> or &quot;<em>Bt.</em>&quot; <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em> is a naturally occurring soil bacteria that  is toxic to the larvae of several species of insects but not toxic to  non-target organisms. It is primarily a pathogen of lepidopterpous pests that  are some of the most damaging. These include american bollworm in cotton and  stem borers in rice. <em>Bacillus  thuringiensis</em> can be applied to plant foliage or incorporated into the  genetic material of crops. <em>Bacillus  thuringiensis</em>, as discovered, is toxic to the caterpillars (larvae) of  moths and butterflies. Several strains of <em>Bt</em> have been developed and now strains are available that control fly larvae.  These can be used in controlling mosquitoes and blackflies.<br />
  <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em> (Bt) is a ubiquitous gram-positive, spore forming bacterium which  produces parasporal crystals during sporulation (stationary phase of its growth  cycle). These crystals are predominantly comprised of d-endotoxins or  insecticidal crystal proteins (ICPs), known to possess insecticidal activity  when ingested by certain insects. The mode of action of Bt involves the  following stages:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>ingestion of  sporulated Bt and ICP by an insect larva.  </strong> </li>
				  <li><strong>solubilization  of the crystalline ICP in the midgut:</strong> When Bt crystals are  ingested by insects, the crystal proteins are dissolved from the crystals. The  pH in the gut of lepidopteran larvae varies between 9 and 12 and the  lepidopteran-specific crystal bodies can only be solubilized above pH9.5. On  getting solubilized in the midgut, the crystalline bodies release the protein  called d-endotoxins. </li>
				  <li><strong>activation of  the ICP by midgut proteases:</strong> The crystalline protoxins are inactive,  until they are hydrolysed by the gut proteases. The proteases cleave amino  acids  from both C-terminus and  N-terminus of the protoxin and thus forms the active toxin. </li>
				  <li><strong>binding of  the activated ICP to specific receptors in the midgut cell membrane:</strong> Brush border  membrane vesicles (BBMVs) is the primary binding site for several insect  species. The active toxins initially bind reversibly to the specific receptors  located on the apical brush border membrane of the columnar cells. </li>
				  <li><strong>insertion of  the toxin in the cell membrane and formation of pores and channels in the gut  cell membrane, followed by destruction of the epithelial cells:</strong> After binding  to the receptor, the toxin inserts irreversibly into the plasma membrane of the  cell. The formation of toxin induced pores in the columnar cell of apical  membranes allows rapid fluxes of ions. The disruption of the gut integerity  leads to the death of the insect through starvation or septicemia. </li>
				  <li><strong>subsequent Bt  spore germination and septicemia may enhance mortality.</strong> </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>For biopesticide applications, the Bt protein  is usually used in a formulation containing the spores and crystalline  inclusions that are released upon lysis of Bt cells during growth. The  molecular potency of the toxin is 300 times greater than synthetic pyrethroids,  and the toxin breaks down quickly when exposed to ultraviolet light/sunlight.<br />
				  Besides <em>Bacillus  thuringiensis</em>, other bacteria like <em>Bacillus  popilliae</em><strong> </strong>and <em>B. sphaericus</em> are also important for  their biocontrol activity. <em>B. popilliae</em> is a Gram-negative spore-forming rod, 1.3 to 5.2 x 0.5 to 0.8 micrometres. It  is a fastidious organism that grows only on rich media containing yeast  extract, casein hydrolysate or an equivalent amino acid source, and sugars.  Trehalose, the sugar found in insect haemolymph, is a favoured carbon source  though glucose also can be used. Some varieties of <em>B. popilliae</em> form a crystalline body inside the cell at the time of  sporulation and in this respect resemble <em>B.  thuringiensis</em>. But the crystal is not thought to play a significant role in  infection and certainly it is not as important as in <em>B. thuringiensis</em>. The variety lentimorbus, for example, does not  produce a crystal and yet it causes disease. Another difference between <em>B. popilliae</em> and <em>B. thuringiensis</em> is that <em>B.  popilliae</em> cannot be induced to sporulate in laboratory media although it  does so readily in the diseased host. Actually there are a number of  oligosporogenic mutants - ones that produce a few spores - but spores for  microbial control programmes are usually produced in living insect larvae - an  expensive and time-consuming process. Its spectrum of control includes larvae  of Japanese beetles, chafers, some May and June beetles. Spores of <em>B. popilliae</em> persist for long periods in  the soil and are ingested by grubs in the soil, and multiply in the hemocoel.  The infected larvae do not molt to the next instar, remain active until just  prior to death when they become sluggish and moribund.<br />
  <strong><em>Bacillus sphaericus</em></strong><strong> </strong>is also  used to control specific kinds of mosquitoes (especially Culex), including some  that transmit diseases such as encephalitis. It is active against the larvae of <em>Culex, Psorophora</em> and <em>Anopheles</em> species; less effective  against Aedes species. It is a naturally occurring bacteria - isolated,  cultured, and labeled for mosquito control. <em>Bacillus  sphaericus</em> acts as an endotoxin to mosquito larvae. It is consumed by the  larvae as live bacterium. The bacterium is able to penetrate through the  intestines of the mosquito larvae into the hemocoel. Once in the hemocoel, <em>B. sphaericus</em> reproduces and releases  lethal doses of toxin killing the mosquito larvae. </p>
				<p><strong>Fungal</strong><br />
                    <em>Beauveria</em> is a naturally occurring  fungus in soils throughout the world, and has been researched for control of  soil borne insects. Many soil insects, however, may have a natural tolerance to  this pathogen, which is not exhibited in many foliar pests. Therefore,  commercial development of this fungus for biological control has primarily been  targeted against foliar feeding pests. <br />
                    <em>Beauveria  bassiana</em> causes a disease known as the white muscadine disease in insects. <em>Beauveria</em> belongs to fungal subdivision:  Deuteromycotina and order: Hyphomycetes. It has a simple life cycle with no  known sexual stage; the asexual spores are called conidia. Many strains of <em>Beauveria bassiana</em> are used as biopesticides.  It is active against adults and larvae of many kinds of insects; eggs of  lepidopteran pests such as moths. The spectrum also includes mole cricket,  chiggers, white grubs, fire ants, ants, flea beetle, boll weevil, whiteflies,  plant bug, grasshoppers, thrips, aphids, mites and many others.<br />
				  When spores of this fungus come in contact with the  cuticle (skin) of susceptible insects, they germinate and grow directly through  the cuticle to the inner body of their host. The fungus proliferates throughout  the insect's body, producing toxins and draining the insect of nutrients,  eventually killing it. Therefore, unlike bacterial and viral pathogens of  insects, <em>Beauveria</em> and other fungal  pathogens infect the insect with contact and do not need to be consumed by their  host to cause infection. Once the fungus has killed it's host, it grows back  out through the softer portions of the cuticle, covering the insect with a  layer of white mold (hence the name white muscadine disease). This downy mold  produces millions of new infective spores that are released to the environment. <br />
  <strong>Viral  (Insect Viruses)</strong><br />
				  Baculoviruses are pathogens that attack insects and other  arthropods. Like some human viruses, they are usually extremely small (less  than a thousandth of a millimeter across), and are composed primarily of  double-stranded DNA that codes for genes needed for virus establishment and  reproduction. Because this genetic material is easily destroyed by exposure to  sunlight or by conditions in the host's gut, an infective baculovirus particle  (virion) is protected by protein coat called a polyhedron (plural polyhedra).  Most insect baculoviruses must be eaten by the host to produce an infection,  that is, typically fatal to the insect.<br />
				  The majority of baculoviruses used as biological control  agents are in the genus Nucleopolyhedrovirus. These viruses are excellent  candidates for species-specific, narrow spectrum insecticidal applications  (Table 8.8). They have been shown to have no negative impacts on plants,  mammals, birds, fish, or even on non-target insects. <br />
				  On the other hand, the high specificity of baculoviruses  is also cited as a weakness for agricultural uses, since growers may want one  product to use against a variety of pests. Currently, researchers are  attempting to use genetic engineering techniques to expand virus host ranges to  the desired pest species. Releases of such genetically-engineered baculoviruses  have been made by researchers in the U.K. and the United States and show  promise, although the cost of commercial production of these agents must be  reduced if they are to be competitive. <br />
				  Viruses are unable to reproduce without a host - they are  obligate parasites. Baculoviruses are no exception. The cells of the host's  body are taken over by the genetic message carried within each virion, and  forced to produce more virus particles until the cell, and ultimately the  insect, dies. Most baculoviruses cause the host insect to die in a way that  will maximize the chance that other insects will come in contact with the virus  and become infected in turn. Infection by baculovirus begins when an insect  eats virus particles on a plant - perhaps from a sprayed treatment. The  infected insect dies and &quot;melts&quot; or falls apart on foliage, releasing  more virus. This additional infective material can infect more insects,  continuing the cycle. <br />
				  It  is widely acknowledged that baculoviruses can be as effective as chemical  pesticides in controlling specific insect pests. However, the expense of  treating a hectare of land with a baculovirus product invariably costs more  than an equally efficacious chemical treament. This difference in price is due  primarily to the labor intensive nature of baculovirus production. Some viruses  can be produced in vitro (within cell cultures in the laboratory, not requiring  whole, living insects). These are less expensive than those that can only be  produced in vivo, that is, inside of living insects. The cost of rearing live  hosts adds greatly to the final cost of the product. It is to be hoped that  insect cell culture systems currently being developed for other uses may  ultimately make viral pesticides more cost-effective.<br />
				  Insects killed by baculoviruses have a characteristic  shiny-oily appearance, and are often seen hanging limply from vegetation. They  are extremely fragile to the touch, rupturing to release fluid filled with  infective virus particles. This tendency to remain attached to foliage and then  rupture is an important aspect of the virus life-cycle. As discussed above,  infection of other insects will only occur if they eat foliage that has been  contaminated by virus-killed larvae.<br />

				<p>Biocontrol</p>
				<p> Biocontrol or  Biological control can be defined as the use of natural enemies to control  pests. Natural enemies of pests are categorized as parasites, predators and  pathogens. It is a broad term that also includes use of biopesticides. <br />
				  About 30% of the yield in agriculture is lost because of  the combined effects of biotic and abiotic stresses, with pathogenic fungi  alone responsible for a reduction of about 12%. Control of fungal pathogens is  based on the use of agronomic practices and pesticides, but widespread  application of chemicals inundates the agroecosystems with toxic compounds that  affect the balance of the natural food chain. In addition, resistant and more  virulent pathogen populations are selected causing escalation in the amount of  pesticides used. A variety of new technologies are being developed to integrate  or substitute the application of chemicals in an attempt to reduce both the  ecological and financial cost of disease control. Antagonistic microorganisms  are being studied in depth and considered as an attractive option for the  development of microbial-based biofungicides. Successful and consistent results  have been achieved with some biocontrol agents such as <em>Agrobacterium</em> and <em>Bacillus</em>,  whose mechanisms of biocontrol are largely understood. However, limitations in  the practical use of bacterial agents often arose from the production of toxic  substances and formulations with a short shelf-life. The application of fungal  biocontrol agents has also been delayed because of difficulties in obtaining  consistent results in biocontrol and the relatively poor understanding of the  plant-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions involved in the antagonistic  processes.<br />
				  While diverse microbes may contribute to the biological  control of plant pathogens, most research and development efforts have focused  on isolates of three genera, <em>Bacillus</em>, <em>Trichoderma</em>, and <em>Pseudomonas</em>.<br />
				  The most studied  fungal biocontrol agents are <em>Trichoderma</em> spp. and some isolates, effective as biofungicides in certain culture  conditions, have been recently introduced in commercial agriculture.  Concurrently, fundamental discoveries concerning the mechanism of action of  these fungi have been made. Studies on the mechanism of biocontrol had  indicated that <em>Trichoderma</em> and other  mycoparasites have developed a vast array of molecular tools to support their  parasitic behaviour. It is believed that <em>Trichoderma</em> produces different types of lytic enzymes that act on the cell wall of fungi  and kill them. Genes encoding for cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDES) such as  chitinolytic, glucanolytic and proteolytic enzymes have been isolated and used  to improve biocontrol capabilities of <em>Trichoderma</em> strains.</p>
				<p>Two species of <em>Trichoderma, T. harzianum </em>and<em> T. viride </em>are commonly used as  biocontrol agent. Their spectrum of control includes fungal pathogens like <em>Armillaria</em>,  <em>Pythium</em>, <em>Rhizoctonia</em>, <em>Verticillium</em>, <em>Sclerotium</em> and <em>Botrytis</em>.			    </p>
