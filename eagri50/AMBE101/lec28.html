				<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
          Although <a href="http://www.greenplastics.com/reference/index.php?title=Plastics" title="Plastics">plastics</a> as we know them today are a relatively recent invention, they have become an  important part of modern life. <br />
<strong>The age of  plastics</strong><br />
          Today, 200 billion pounds (100 million  tons) of plastics are produced worldwide every year. Plastics are used for  packaging, building materials, and virtually every type of consumer product.  Past ages of human society have been called the Stone, Bronze, Copper, Iron,  and Steel Ages, based on the material that was relied upon the most during that  time. Today, the total volume of plastics produced worldwide has surpassed that  of steel and continues to increase. Without a doubt, we have entered the Age of  Plastics. <br />
          Some common plastic items include:  sunglasses, tooth brushes, super glue, paint brushes, tennis shoes, Frisbees,  2-liter bottles, Honda CRX's, Astroturf, photographs, street signs, pens,  automobile paint, video tapes, rubber bands, balloons, bicycle tires,  umbrellas, guitar strings, carpeting, shower doors, hearing aids, Scotch Tape,  fishing lines, trash bags, and toilet seats. Plastic can be found in everything  from clothing to machinary. <br />
          It is important to understand the  nature of plastics, and the consequences of their production and use. Virtually  all plastics are made from nonrenewable resources, such as oil, coal or natural  gas, which will eventually become exhausted. Plastics waste is increasing,  adding to the already burdensome problems of waste management. And the use of  plastics continues to grow, raising the important question, how can we balance  convenient living with concern for ecology? To understand this concern, it is  helpful to understand what plastics are. </p>
				<h2><a name="Why_green_plastics.3F" id="Why_green_plastics.3F"></a>Why green plastics? </h2>
				<p>          <a href="http://www.greenplastics.com/reference/index.php?title=Green_plastics" title="Green plastics">Green plastics</a> are the focus of an emerging industry focused on making convenient living  consistent with environmental stability. One reason to make a shift toward the  use of <a href="http://www.greenplastics.com/reference/index.php?title=Green_plastics" title="Green plastics">green plastics</a> is the availability of raw materials. Green plastics can be made using <a href="http://www.greenplastics.com/reference/index.php?title=Polymers" title="Polymers">polymers</a> that come from <a href="http://www.greenplastics.com/reference/index.php?title=Agricultural_feedstocks" title="Agricultural feedstocks">agricultural</a> and <a href="http://www.greenplastics.com/reference/index.php?title=Marine_feedstocks" title="Marine feedstocks">marine feedstocks</a>.  These are abundant natural resources that are constantly being replenished.  This, in turn could revitalize rural economy, both agricultural and marine, by  providing additional demand for currently underutilized land or low-valued  biomass commodities. <br />
				  Another favorable property of green  plastics is their <a href="http://www.greenplastics.com/reference/index.php?title=Biodegradability" title="Biodegradability">biodegradability</a>,  making them a natural material for use in such applications as compostable collection  bags, such as for food or yard waste. <br />
				  But <a href="http://www.greenplastics.com/reference/index.php?title=Bioplastics" title="Bioplastics">bioplastics</a> have to possess adequate <a href="http://www.greenplastics.com/reference/index.php?title=Physical_properties" title="Physical properties">physical properties</a>.  Their properties have to be managed and controlled with technological means  through the development of adequate formulations and <a href="http://www.greenplastics.com/reference/index.php?title=Plastics_processing" title="Plastics processing">plastics processing</a>.  The commercial ventures already under way in the United States, Canada, Europe,  and Japan indicate that there is confidence technological advances are  possible. The key to solving technical problems is often simply knowing what  the problems are. <br />
				  Bioplastics also have to be  cost-competitive. Commercially available <a href="http://www.greenplastics.com/reference/index.php?title=Biopolymers" title="Biopolymers">biopolymers</a> are typically more  expensive than <a href="http://www.greenplastics.com/reference/index.php?title=Synthetic_polymers" title="Synthetic polymers">synthetic polymers</a>,  often significantly so. Currently only starch competes with <a href="http://www.greenplastics.com/reference/index.php?title=Synthetic_polymers" title="Synthetic polymers">synthetic polymers</a> in terms of cost. <br />
				  Interest in the development of  bioplastics will grow largely to the extent that there is real interest in and  concern over the environment. Societal concern over the environment is already  being reflected in governmental restrictive legislation on the use of plastics,  particularly aimed at plastic packaging. Legislation has begun at the local,  state, federal, and international levels, and legislation will undoubtedly  increase in the future. New legislation will likely contain restrictions aimed  at materials that are neither recyclable nor biodegradable. Labeling  legislation may lead to an &quot;ecolabel,&quot; based on a product's raw  material usage, energy consumption, emissions from manufacture and use, and  waste disposal impact. Most of all, what is needed is a paradigm shift. </p>
				<h2><a name="Making_it_a_reality" id="Making_it_a_reality"></a>Making it a reality </h2>
				<p>          Ignoring nature's way of building  strong materials, we have, for many applications, over-engineered our plastics  for stability, with little consideration of their recyclability or ultimate  fate, and ended up transforming irreplaceable resources into mountains of  waste. <br />
				  There is another way. We can take  nature's building materials and use them for our purposes, without taking them  out of nature's cycles. We can be borrowers, not consumers, so that the process  can continue indefinitely. If society is indeed, becoming more and more  committed to resource conservation, environmental preservation and sustainable  technologies, bioplastics will find their place in this Age of Plastics. <br />
				  The widespread use of these new  plastics will depend on developing technologies that can be successful in the  marketplace. That in turn will partly depend on how strongly society is  committed to the concepts of resource conservation, environmental preservation,  and sustainable technologies. There are growing signs that people indeed want  to live in greater harmony with nature and leave future generations a healthy  planet. If so, bioplastics will find a place in the current Age of Plastics. </p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Plastics</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Plastics are a class of  material that has one or more <a href="http://www.greenplastics.com/reference/index.php?title=Polymers" title="Polymers">polymers</a> as its primary ingredient, that is shaped by flow when it is processed (usually  using heat), and that is solid in its final form. Plastics can be made up of  many different kinds of polymer, and can be processed in many different ways,  but as long as they satisfy these three conditions, they are <em>bona fide</em> plastics. <br />
				  The general &quot;recipe&quot; for any  kind of plastic is a combination of three ingredients: a <a href="http://www.greenplastics.com/reference/index.php?title=Polymer" title="Polymer">polymer</a>,  one or more <a href="http://www.greenplastics.com/reference/index.php?title=Plasticizers" title="Plasticizers">plasticizers</a>, and one or more <a href="http://www.greenplastics.com/reference/index.php?title=Additives" title="Additives">additives</a>. These ingredients can  then be <a href="http://www.greenplastics.com/reference/index.php?title=Plastics_processing" title="Plastics processing">processed</a> into different shapes, resulting in a wide variety of different materials with  different <a href="http://www.greenplastics.com/reference/index.php?title=Properties" title="Properties">properties</a>. </p>
				<h2>Polymers </h2>
				<p><strong>            </strong>Polymers are long  molecules. They are one of the basic components of all plastics. </p>
				<h2><a name="Synthetic_polymers" id="Synthetic_polymers"></a>Synthetic polymers </h2>
				<p><strong>            </strong>Synthetic polymers  are polymers that are man-made. Most synthetic polymers are manufactured from  petroleum. <br />
				  Some  examples of synthetic polymers include: </p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>polystyrene</strong> is the polymer found in  styrofoam, used for everything from packing materials and insulation to  drinking cups. </li>
				  <li><strong>polyvinyl  chloride</strong>,  widely known by its abbreviation PVC, is used in a lot of building material  (and is well-known as being ubiquitous in piping). </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>          These materials are generally not  biodegradable, and because they are made from petroleum, once the basic  materials for creating them are used up, we cannot make any more. </p>
				<h2><a name="Biopolymers" id="Biopolymers"></a>Biopolymers </h2>
				<p><strong>            </strong>Biopolymers are polymers that  occur in nature. Carbohydrates and proteins, for example, are biopolymers. Many  biopolymers are already being produced commercially on large scales, although  they usually are not used for the production of plastics. Even if only a small  percentage of the biopolymers already being produced were used in the  production of plastics, it would significantly decrease our dependence on  manufactured, non-renewable resources. <br />
				  Some  examples of biopolymers include: </p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li><strong>cellulose</strong> is the most plentiful carbohydrate in the world; 40 percent of all organic       matter is cellulose! </li>
				  <li><strong>starch</strong> is found in corn (maize), potatoes, wheat, tapioca (cassava), and some       other plants. Annual world production of starch is well over 70 billion       pounds, with much of it being used for non-food purposes, like making       paper, cardboard, textile sizing, and adhesives. </li>
				  <li><strong>collagen</strong> is the most abundant protein found in mammals. Gelatin is denatured       collagen, and is used in sausage casings, capsules for drugs and vitamin       preparations, and other miscellaneous industrial applications including       photography. </li>
				  <li><strong>casein</strong>,       commercially produced mainly from cow's skimmed milk, is used in       adhesives, binders, protective coatings, and other products. </li>
				  <li><strong>soy       protein</strong> and zein (from corn) are       abundant plant proteins. They are used for making adhesives and coatings       for paper and cardboard. </li>
				  <li><strong>polyesters</strong> are produced by bacteria, and can be made commercially on large scales       through fermentation processes. They are now being used in biomedical       applications. </li>
			    </ul>
				<ul>
				  <li>A number of other natural  materials can be made into polymers that are biodegradable. For example: </li>
			    </ul>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li><strong>lactic       acid</strong> is now commercially produced on large       scales through the fermentation of sugar feedstocks obtained from sugar       beets or sugar cane, or from the conversion of starch from corn, potato       peels, or other starch source. It can be polymerized to produce polylactic       acid. </li>
				  <li><strong>triglycerides</strong> can also be polymerized. Triglycerides make up a large part of the storage       lipids in animal and plant cells. Over sixteen billion pounds of vegetable       oils are produced in the United States each year, mainly from soybean,       flax, and rapeseed. Triglycerides are another promising raw material for       producing plastics. </li>
			    </ul>
				<ul>
				  <li>These natural raw  materials are abundant, renewable, and biodegradable, making them attractive  feedstocks for bioplastics. </li>
			    </ul>
				<h2>Plasticizers </h2>
				<p>          A plasticizer is a substance that can be added to material to  increase its workability, flexibility, or pliability. Plasticizers are one of  basic ingredients of all plastics.</p>
				<h2><a name="Additives" id="Additives"></a>Additives </h2>
				<p>          An additive is a substance that can be added to material to change  its properties, usually to make the end product more desirable in some way.  Additives are one of basic ingredients of all plastics.<br />
				  The pure polymer resin by itself may  not always have the physical properties needed in the final product, it may be  strong but too brittle, flexible but too elastic, or flexible and elastic but  just plain ugly. Just like the polymer material itself, additives come in  different varieties: some can be found in the environment, while others are  manufactured. The amounts and types of additives used in manufacturing plastics  are another factor that influence how environmentally-friendly they are. </p>
				<p><strong>Green Plastics</strong> <br />
                    <strong>            </strong>Green Plastics,  sometimes also called Bioplastics,  are plastics that are biodegradable and are usually made mostly or entirely  from renewable resources. Frequently there is also a focus on environmentally  friendly processing. Green plastics are the focus of an emerging industry  focused on making convenient living consistent with environmental stability. <br />
				  Like  all plastics, bioplastics are composed of a polymer, combined with plasticizers  and additives, and processed using extrusion or thermosetting. What makes green  plastics &quot;green&quot; is one or more of the following properties: </p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>they       are biodegradable </li>
				  <li>they       are made from renewable ingredients </li>
				  <li>they       have environmentally friendly processing </li>
			    </ol>
				<ul>
				  <li>Because different  compounds can satisfy some or all of these criteria to different degrees, there  are different &quot;degrees of green&quot; in green plastics. To evaluate how  &quot;green&quot; a plastic material is, you need to ask three questions: </li>
			    </ul>
				<ol start="5" type="1">
                  <li>how       quickly can the plastic be re-integrated into the environment after it is       no longer being used? </li>
				  <li>how       quickly are the ingredients that go into making the plastic created in the       environment? </li>
				  <li>how       much pollution or waste is created during the process of actually making       the plastic? </li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Traditional  plastics fail on all three of these points. </strong></p>
				<h2>1. <a name="Biodegradability_.28What_happens_to_them" id="Biodegradability_.28What_happens_to_them"></a>Biodegradability </h2>
				<p><strong>            </strong>Biodegradation  is a process where something breaks down into simple compounds as a result of  the action of microorganisms (like bacteria, fungi, or algae). The term biodegradation is actually a  contraction, short for &quot;biotic degradation.&quot; Something is biodegradable if it <em>can</em> be  broken down by this kind of process. <br />
				  In  order to say that something &quot;biodegrades&quot;, it therefore has to meet  the following requirements: </p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>it       has to break down (this is simply &quot;degradation&quot;) </li>
				  <li>it's       molecules have to break down from complex molecules into simpler ones       (this is &quot;chemical degradation&quot;) </li>
				  <li>the       breaking down of its molecules has to be accomplished by microorganisms. </li>
			    </ol>
				<ul>
				  <li>In order to prevent  misinformation in advertising, standards organizations have made even more  strict requirements for something to be labelled as biodegradable. In addition  to the above list, something can only be labelled as &quot;biodegradable&quot;  if: </li>
			    </ul>
				<ol start="5" type="1">
                  <li>The       biodegradation of the material has to be scientifically measurable. Since       most biodegradation produces CO2 as a by-product, usually this       is measured by the amount of CO2 produced. </li>
				  <li>The       biodegradation of the material has to be fast enough to have a significant       effect in a reasonable amount of time. For example, the ISO standard requires       60% biodegradation within 180 days for a material to be called       biodegradable; the Europenan Norm EN13432 is more strict, requiring 90%       biodegradation within 90 days. </li>
			    </ol>
				<h2><a name="Types_of_Biodegradation" id="Types_of_Biodegradation"></a>Types of  Biodegradation </h2>
				<p>          Because biodegradation requires  microorganism to do something to a material, usually the material has to be  broken up into smaller pieces first. As a result, most biodegradable materials <em>become</em> biodegradable after the action of another kind of degradation. </p>
				<h3><a name="Hydro-biodegradable" id="Hydro-biodegradable"></a>Hydro-biodegradable </h3>
				<p><strong>            </strong>Hydro-biodegradable  materials are first broken down by interaction with water (a process called  hydrolysis), and then are further broken down by microorganisms. </p>
				<h3><a name="Photo-biodegradable" id="Photo-biodegradable"></a>Photo-biodegradable </h3>
				<p>          Photo-biodegradable  materials are first broken down by interaction with sunlight (a process called  photolysis), and then are further broken down by microorganisms. </p>
				<h3><a name="Oxo-degradable" id="Oxo-degradable"></a>Oxo-degradable </h3>
				<p>          Some companies have been claiming that  they have created an additive that can be added to traditional plastics to make  them biodegradable. These products become what is called <strong>oxo-degradable</strong>,  and sometimes is incorrectly identified as <strong>oxo-biodegradable</strong>. <br />
				  Although this allows the plastic to  return to the environment, these products are not biodegradable. Instead, the additive allows the plastic  material to break down physically when exposed to water, into pieces small  enough to be accidentally ingested by microbes. However, the microbes are not  able to actually break this material down further. The end result is therefore  a material that combines biomass with polymer residue. The plastic never  decomposes as a result of interaction with the organisms. This process is  therefore more accurately called &quot;disintergration&quot; rather than  &quot;biodegradation&quot;. <br />
				  For bioplastics to become practical,  they must have properties that allow them to compete with the current plastics  on the market: bioplastics must be able to be strong, resiliant, flexible,  elastic, and above all, durable. It is the very durability of traditional  plastics that has helped them in the marketplace, and has been a major goal of plastics  research throughout the years. However, it is exactly this durability that now  has people increasingly worried. Now that we wrap our sandwiches in bags that  will still be around when the sandwich, and even the person who ate it, are  long gone, many people are wondering: have we gone too far? <br />
				  There is a lot of current research  going on concerning methods of decomposition. There is also research on  controlling the time-line of biodegradation. One goal of this research is to  make a product that is programmed-degradable: in other words, a product that  allows you to control when and how it degrades, while insuring that the product  remains strong while it is still in use. </p>
				<h2><a name="Renewability_.28What_are_they_made_of.3F" id="Renewability_.28What_are_they_made_of.3F"></a>2. Renewability </h2>
				<p><a name="Processing_.28How_are_they_made.3F.29" id="Processing_.28How_are_they_made.3F.29"></a>          A renewable resource is a natural resource that is created in the  environment faster than it is used up by people. Many people think of  &quot;renewability&quot; as a fixed trait: some things (like trees, grass, and  wind) are renewable, while others (like oil and coal) are not. In fact, whether  a resource is renewable depends on both how fast it is replenished and how fast  people use it. As a result, some resources are <em>more</em> renewable than  others, and some resources may or may not be renewable depending on how they  are used. </p>
				<h2><a name="Rate_of_Renewal" id="Rate_of_Renewal"></a>Rate of Renewal </h2>
				<p>          The rate of rewal (sometimes also  called the &quot;sustainable yield&quot;) of a resource tells you how quickly  it can be replenished by the environment. <br />
				  Solar energy, tides, rainfall, and  winds are considered <em>perpetual resources</em> for energy because they renew  much faster than they could ever be used. (Can you imagine us &quot;using  up&quot; the wind, so that we would have to wait until the earth made more?) <br />
				  Living organisms provide the majority  of resources that are generally considered &quot;renewable&quot;, because they  generally renew themelves within a reasonable amount of time relative to how  quickly they are use. Agricultural feedstocks and marine feedstocks are two  major categories of living organism feedstocks. Within this category, some  organisms renew faster than others: for example, it takes much longer to grow a  new tree than it does to grow grass. <br />
				  Most of the resources that are  considered &quot;non-renewable&quot; are based on coal, oil, natural gas, and  other substances that take so long for the environment to create that almost  any use of these resources at all will cause them to be used up before any more  is created. Petro-chemical feedstocks are feedstocks derived from petroleum  principally for the manufacture of chemicals, synthetic rubber, and a variety  of plastics. </p>
				<h2><a name="Rate_of_Use" id="Rate_of_Use"></a>Rate of Use </h2>
				<p>          Imagine you live in a small village by  a river. A turbine on the river spins, and it can generate enough electricity  for the entire village every day. Clearly, their hydroelectric power is a  completely renewable resource. However, as the size of the village grows, their  energy use grows. If eventually the needs of the village far outstrip the  energy that can be provided by the turbine, then the hydroelectric energy from  the river is no longer a renewable resource for the village: the rate of use  has exceeded the rate of replenishment. </p>
				 <p>The  same issue exists for the use of plants. As long as our use of (for example)  corn remains moderate compared to the amount of corn produced, corn is a  renewable resource. However, if our use of corn increases dramatically <em>without</em> a corresponding increase in corn crop production, then corn will cease to be a  renewable resource: we will use it all up, and we will either have to cease  production until the corn renews itself or (worse) it will become extinct, so  it will not replenish at all.<br />
			    </p>
				 <p><strong>3. Processing </strong></p>
				 <p>          When making plastics, the initial mass  of polymer, called resin, is processed into different shapes using a variety of  methods, including: extrusion, injection molding, compression molding, transfer  molding, and casting. Different processing techniques result in the wide  variety of forms that plastic can take: ranging from thin films and elastic  sheets, to resiliant panels and hard, solid three-dimensional shapes. </p>
				<h2><a name="History_of_Bioplastics" id="History_of_Bioplastics"></a>HISTORY OF  BIOPLASTICS </h2>
				<p>          The use of natural polymers is not  entirely a new idea. In one form or another, green plastics have been around  for a long time. </p>
				<h3><a name="Early_History" id="Early_History"></a>Early History </h3>
				<p>          Natural resins-like amber, shellac,  and gutta percha-have been mentioned throughout history, including during Roman  times and the Middle Ages. Native Americans were developing and refining  techniques for making ladles and spoons from animal horns long before there was  any European contact. In Europe, molded horn jewelry and snuff boxes were  popular in the eighteenth century. </p>
				<h3><a name="The_1800.27s" id="The_1800.27s"></a>The 1800's </h3>
				<p>          Significant commercialization of  bioplastics only began in the middle of the nineteenth century... The American  inventor, John Wesley Hyatt, Jr., was looking for a substitute for ivory in the  manufacture of billiard balls, and in 1869 patented a cellulose derivative for  coating non-ivory billiard balls. That attempt, however, was affected by the  coating's flammability; balls were occasionally ignited when lit cigars  accidentally came into contact with them. Hyatt continued working on the  project and soon developed celluloid, the first widely used plastic, now most  widely known for its use in photographic and movie film. </p>

				<p>          The history of plastics changed  dramatically in the early 1900s, as petroleum emerged as a source of fuel and  of chemicals. The early bioplastics were simply displaced by plastics made from  synthetic polymers. World War II brought on a large increase in plastics  production, a growth which continues to this day. </p>
				<h3><a name="The_1920.27s" id="The_1920.27s"></a>The 1920's </h3>
				<p>          In the 1920s Henry Ford experimented  with using soybeans in the manufacture of automobiles. Ford was partly  motivated by a desire to find non-food applications for agricultural surpluses,  which existed then as they do now. Soy plastics were used for an increasing  number of automobile parts, like steering wheels, interior trim, and dashboard  panels. Finally Ford gave the go-ahead to produce a complete prototype  &quot;plastic car.&quot; Ford, a master at generating publicity, exhibited the  prototype with great fanfare in 1941, but by the end of the year was no longer  publicizing the &quot;plastic car,&quot; probably for a variety of reasons.  World War II played a role: armament work took precedent over almost everything  else, and steel shortages limited all non-defense production. Today plastic  automobile parts are common, but the use of plastics made from renewable raw  materials got side-tracked. </p>

				<p>          One well established bioplastic that  has survived the growth of the synthetic plastics industry is cellophane, a  sheet material derived from cellulose. Although production peaked in the 1960s  it is still used in packaging for candy, cigarettes, and other articles. </p>
				<h3><a name="The_2000.27s_and_Beyond" id="The_2000.27s_and_Beyond"></a>The 2000's and Beyond </h3>
				<p>          Demand for materials like plastics is  continually growing and will not be abated. Today, the plastics industry is an  important component of our economy: The U.S. plastics industry includes over  20,000 facilities that produce or distribute materials or products, employ over  1.5 million workers, and ship over $300 billion in products each year. <br />
				  The  magnitude of the plastics industry, however, is itself a cause for concern. The  pressures of increasing waste and diminishing resources have lead many to try  to re-discover natural polymers and put them to use as materials for manufactor  and industry. As a result, there is increasing interest in the promise of a new  generation of green plastics. </p>
