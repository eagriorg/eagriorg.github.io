				<p><strong>BIOGAS  (Methane) </strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>Biogas is mixture of  methane (50-60 per cent), CO2 (30 – 40 per cent), hydrogen (5-10 per  cent), H2S and nitrogen (traces), produced from anaerobic digestion  of animal, plant wastes or any cellulose containing waste material. The  digester used for biogas production is called a Biogas plant. A typical biogas  plant using cowdung as a raw material consists of: <em>(a)</em> digester and <em>(b) </em>gas  holder. The digesters are either of (a) batch type which are filled once,  sealed and emptied when the raw materials stop producing gas or (b) continuous  type which are fed with a definite quantity of waste at regular intervals so  that gas production is continuous and regular. The nature of fermentation in  the digester is anaerobic  <br />
 <strong>Methane  production</strong> <br />
Involves three  process viz., hydrolysis, acidification and methonization</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Four different groups of  organisms are involved</li>
				  <li><strong>Hydrolytic  bacteria</strong> -catabolises carbohydrates,proteins,  lipids and other components of biomass into fatty acids,H2 and CO2 </li>
				  <li><strong>H2  producing acetogenic bacxteria</strong> :Catabolises fatty  acids, and the neutral ebd products of I group into acetate,CO2 and  H2 </li>
				  <li><strong>Homoacetogenic  bacteria</strong> : Synthesize acetate using H2,CO2  and formate</li>
				  <li><strong>Methanogenic  bacteria</strong> : Utilizes acetate,CO2,H2  to produce methane </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>                   The first group of bacteria  includes facultative as well as strict anaerobes like <em>Cellulomonas, Bacillus, Eubacterium</em> etc.</p>
				<p><img width="624" height="630" src="lec27_clip_image002.jpg" alt="Description: FoodWeb" /> </p>
				<p><strong>Methanogenic  phase </strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>It is a strict anaerobic  phase and during this phase organic Carbon is converted to microbial mass, CO2  and methane.</li>
				  <li>These bacteria are  sensitive to pH and optimum is 6.8- 7.2. Drop in pH leads to inhibition of  methanogenesis </li>
				  <li><em>Methanobacterium,  Methanomicrobium, Methanococcus, Methanosarcina </em></li>
			    </ul>

				<p><strong>Alcohol  production</strong><br />
				  Production of ethyl alcohol from sugary materials is  one of the oldest known microbiological processes. Alcohol is an important  solvent and raw material used in a variety of chemical industries. Although  today industrial alcohol is also produced synthetically from ethylene,  production of alcohol by fermentation of cheap sugary materials such as  molasses by yeast is still an important industry. <br />
  <img width="531" height="306" src="lec27_clip_image009.gif" alt="Description: C:\Documents and Settings\ELB-ADMIN\Desktop\alcferm.gif" /> <br />
				  For ethyl alcohol production, selected  strains of <em>Saccharomyces cerevisae</em> are employed since all the strains are not equally efficient. The alcohol  tolerance and sugar tolerance are important criteria used in the selection of  yeast strains. Strains tolerant to high sugar and alcohol concentration are  desired. The raw material generally used is either crude cane molasses or best  molasses which contain about 50 per cent fermentable sugars. The production  process involves the dilution of molasses to a suitable sugar concentration  (15- 16 per cent sugars), addition of small quantity of nitrogen source (urea,  ammonium sulphate or ammonium phosphate), adjustment of pH to about 5.0 and the  addition of an actively growing yeast culture. The fermentation is carried out  in big deep tanks of steel or stainless steel. The fermentation is allowed to  continue for about 24 – 36 h at 250C to 300C after which  the cells are allowed to settle. The fermented mash is then distilled and  passed through rectifying columns to recover ethyl alcohol. A large amount of  carbon-di oxide is also produced during the fermentation which is purified and  compressed. The yield of ethyl alcohol is about 50 per cent of the fermentable  sugar concentration. Further purification of ethyl alcohol is done by  fractional distillation. In some distilleries, the yeast is recovered and used  as animal feed while in most, it is discarded into the effluents, a procedure  that is very undesirable. <br />
				  In recent years because of the possibility of using  ethyl alcohol as a fuel supplement and a chemical feed stock, there is  increased interest in increasing production but at a cheaper and economical  rate. For this, a variety of improvements in the traditional batch fermentation  have been described in literature. Among these, the one that has attracted  attention is the cell recycle technique which does not involve much additional  expenditure. Basically, the technique involves the reuse of cell mass that is produced  during the fermentation. It has been found that by doing so, about 5-10 per  cent of the substrate which would have been otherwise used for cell growth is  saved in addition to a great saving in the cost of inoculum and time. By using  recycling technology, fermentation time has been drastically reduced from 24-  36 hours in a batch fermentation to as low as 5-6 hours. <br />

				<p><strong>Distilled  Alcoholic Beverages</strong> <br />
          Whisky, rum, gin, brandy and vodka,  are all products of alcoholic fermentation of different raw materials such as  grains, molasses, potatoes and fruits are distilled products containing higher  content of alcohol than either wine or beer. In principle, production of these  alcoholic beverages is similar to the production of industrial alcohol. The quality  of the alcohol produced and used for the production of these beverages depends  on the type of secondary fractional alcohol distillation. It is essential to  derive a pure spirit for the production of these beverages. <br />
Whisky is traditionally produced from the fermentation  of grain mash, rum from molasses, brandy from grape wines and vodka from  potatoes. The flavour and aroma are introduced into the purified alcohol during  the blending process. Sometimes, these alcoholic beverages are allowed to age  for long periods in wooden casks before they are consumed.			    </p>
