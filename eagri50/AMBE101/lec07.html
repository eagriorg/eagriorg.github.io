				<p>Bacteriophage  (phage) are obligate intracellular parasites that multiply inside bacteria by  making use of some or all of the host biosynthetic machinery <strong>(pathmicro.med.sc.edu/ppt).</strong> The term is commonly used in its shortened form, phage. Interestingly, Bacteriophages are much smaller than the  bacteria they destroy.Phages are estimated to be the most widely distributed  and diverse entities in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a>.  Phages are ubiquitous and can be found in all reservoirs populated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacterial</a> hosts, such as soil or the intestines of animals. One of the densest natural  sources for phages and other viruses is sea water. They have been used for over 60 years as an  alternative to antibiotics, however, this much controversial area of research <strong>(http://www.phages.org).</strong><strong> </strong><br />
Typical phages have hollow heads (where the phage  DNA or RNA is stored) and tunnel tails, the tips of which have the ability to  bind to specific molecules on the surface of their target bacteria. The viral  DNA is then injected through the tail into the host cell, where it directs the  production of progeny phages often over a hundred in half an hour. These  &quot;young&quot; phages burst from the host cell (killing it) and infect more  bacteria.<br />
				</p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><img src="071" /></p>
				<p><strong>Composition</strong><strong> of bacteriophages</strong><br />
				  Although different bacteriophages  may contain different materials they all  contain nucleic acid and protein. Depending upon the phage, the nucleic acid  can be either DNA or RNA but not both and it can exist in various forms.  Bacteriophages have been classified as: <br />
				  <img src="027" /><br />
				  The nucleic acids of phages often  contain unusual or modified bases. These modified bases protect phage nucleic  acid from nucleases that break down host nucleic acids during phage infection.  The size of the nucleic acid varies depending upon the phage. The simplest  phages only have enough nucleic acid to code for 3-5 average size gene products  while the more complex phages may code for over 100 gene products.<br />
				  The number of different kinds of  protein and the amount of each kind of protein in the phage particle will vary  depending upon the phage. The simplest phages have many copies of only one or  two different proteins while more complex phages may have many different kinds.  The proteins function in infection and to protect the nucleic acid from  nucleases in the environment. Phages are also commonly employed in gene  cloning, especially those exhibiting lytic and lysogenic cycles <strong>(http://www.web-books.com)</strong> <br />
                  <a href="http://biology-animations.blogspot.com/search/label/virus"><strong>Structure</strong> <strong>of bacteriophages</strong></a><strong> </strong><br />
				  Bacteriophage  comes in many different sizes and shapes. The basic structural features of  bacteriophages are (which depicts the phage called T4) <br />
                  <strong>1. Size -</strong> T4 is among the largest phages; it is approximately 200 nm long and 80-100 nm  wide. Other phages are smaller. Most phages range in size from 24-200 nm in  length.<br />
                  <strong>2. Head or  Capsid -</strong> All phages contain a head structure which  can vary in size and shape. Some are icosahedral (20 sides) others are  filamentous. The head or capsid is composed of many copies of one or more  different proteins. Inside the head is found the nucleic acid. The head acts as  the protective covering for the nucleic acid.<br />
                  <strong>3. Tail -</strong> Many but not all phages have tails attached to the phage head. The tail is a  hollow tube through which the nucleic acid passes during infection. The size of  the tail can vary and some phages do not even have a tail structure. In the  more complex phages like T4 the tail is surrounded by a contractile sheath  which contracts during infection of the bacterium. At the end of the tail the  more complex phages like T4 have a base plate and one or more tail fibers  attached to it. The base plate and tail fibers are involved in the binding of  the phage to the bacterial cell. Not all phages have base plates and tail  fibers. In these instances other structures are involved in binding of the  phage particle to the bacterium.<br />

				<p><strong> Infection of Host  Cells </strong><strong>(http://  biology.about.com/od/virology)</strong></p>
				<p><strong> </strong><img src="074" /></p>
				<p><strong>A. Adsorption</strong><br />
                    <strong>            </strong>The  first step in the infection process is the adsorption of the phage to the  bacterial cell. This step is mediated by the tail fibers or by some analogous  structure on those phages that lack tail fibers and it is reversible. The tail  fibers attach to specific receptors on the bacterial cell and the host  specificity of the phage (i.e. the bacteria that it is able to infect) is  usually determined by the type of tail fibers that a phage has. The nature of  the bacterial receptor varies for different bacteria. Examples include proteins  on the outer surface of the bacterium, LPS, pili, and lipoprotein. These  receptors are on the bacteria for other purposes and phages have evolved to use  these receptors for infection.<br />
                    <strong>B. Irreversible attachment</strong> <br />
                  The attachment of the phage to the  bacterium via the tail fibers is a weak one and is reversible. Irreversible  binding of phage to a bacterium is mediated by one or more of the components of  the base plate. Phages lacking base plates have other ways of becoming tightly  bound to the bacterial cell.VIE&nbsp;<br />
                  <strong>C. Sheath Contraction</strong> <br />
				  The irreversible binding of the  phage to the bacterium results in the contraction of the sheath (for those  phages which have a sheath) and the hollow tail fiber is pushed through the  bacterial envelope. Phages that don't have contractile sheaths use other  mechanisms to get the phage particle through the bacterial envelope. Some  phages have enzymes that digest various components of the bacterial envelope.<br />
                  <strong>D. Nucleic Acid Injection</strong><br />
                  <strong>            </strong>When  the phage has gotten through the bacterial envelope the nucleic acid from the  head passes through the hollow tail and enters the bacterial cell. Usually, the  only phage component that actually enters the cell is the nucleic acid. The  remainder of the phage remains on the outside of the bacterium. There are some  exceptions to this rule. This is different from animal cell viruses in which  most of the virus particle usually gets into the cell. This difference is  probably due to the inability of bacteria to engulf materials.<br />

				<p><strong>LYTIC AND LYSOGENIC CYCLES -</strong><strong> PHAGE  MULTIPLICATION CYCLE</strong></p>
				<p><strong>A. Definition  -</strong> Lytic or virulent phages are phages which  can only multiply on bacteria and kill the cell by lysis at the end of the life  cycle.<br />
                </p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><img src="076" /><img src="077" /></p>
				<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVkCyU5aeeU"><strong>Lytic  or Virulent Phages</strong></a><strong> </strong><br />
                  <strong>a. </strong><a href="http://www.seyet.com/bacteriophage-t4"><strong>Eclipse  period</strong></a> - During the eclipse phase,  no infectious phage particles can be found either inside or outside the  bacterial cell. The phage nucleic acid takes over the host biosynthetic  machinery and phage specified m-RNA's and proteins are made. There is an  orderly expression of phage directed macromolecular synthesis, just as one sees  in animal virus infections. Early m-RNA's code for early proteins which are  needed for phage DNA synthesis and for shutting off host DNA, RNA and protein  biosynthesis. In some cases the early proteins actually degrade the host  chromosome. After phage DNA is made late m-RNA's and late proteins are made.  The late proteins are the structural proteins that comprise the phage as well  as the proteins needed for lysis of the bacterial cell.<br />
                  <strong>b. Intracellular Accumulation Phase</strong> - In this phase the nucleic acid and structural proteins that have been made  are assembled and infectious phage particles accumulate within the cell.<br />
                  <strong>c. Lysis and Release Phase</strong> - After a while the bacteria begin to lyse due to the accumulation of the phage  lysis protein and intracellular phage are released into the medium. The number  of particles released per infected bacteria may be as high as 1000.<br />
                  <strong>Assay for  Lytic Phage </strong><br />
                  <strong>a. Plaque assay</strong> - Lytic phage are enumerated by a plaque assay. A plaque is a clear area which  results from the lysis of bacteria. Each plaque arises from a single infectious  phage. The infectious particle that gives rise to a plaque is called a pfu  (plaque forming unit). <br />
                  <img src="078" /><br />
                  <a href="http://biology-animations.blogspot.com/2009/09/virus-lysogenic-cycle-animation.html"><strong>B. Lysogenic or Temperate Phage</strong></a><strong> </strong><br />
                  <strong>1. Definition</strong> - Lysogenic or temperate phages are those that can either multiply via the  lytic cycle or enter a quiescent state in the cell. In this quiescent state  most of the phage genes are not transcribed; the phage genome exists in a  repressed state. The phage DNA in this repressed state is called a <strong>prophage</strong> because it is not a phage but it has the potential to produce phage. In most  cases the phage DNA actually integrates into the host chromosome and is  replicated along with the host chromosome and passed on to the daughter cells.  The cell harboring a prophage is not adversely affected by the presence of the  prophage and the lysogenic state may persist indefinitely. The cell harboring a  prophage is termed a <strong>lysogen</strong>.<br />
                  <strong>2. Events  Leading to Lysogeny - The Prototype Phage: Lambda</strong><br />
                  <strong>a. Circularization of the phage chromosome</strong> - Lambda DNA is a double stranded linear molecule with small single stranded  regions at the 5' ends. These single stranded ends are complementary (<strong>cohesive  ends</strong>) so that they can base pair and produce a circular molecule. In the  cell the free ends of the circle can be ligated to form a covalently closed  circle as illustrated in Figure&nbsp;5.<br />
                  <strong>b. Site-specific recombination</strong> - A recombination event, catalyzed by a phage coded enzyme, occurs between a  particular site on the circularized phage DNA and a particular site on the host  chromosome. The result is the integration of the phage DNA into the host  chromosome as illustrated in Figure 6.<br />
                  <strong>c. Repression of the phage genome</strong> - A phage coded protein, called a <strong>repressor</strong>, is made which binds to a  particular site on the phage DNA, called the <strong>operator</strong>, and shuts off  transcription of most phage genes EXCEPT the repressor gene. The result is a  stable repressed phage genome which is integrated into the host chromosome.  Each temperate phage will only repress its own DNA and not that from other  phage, so that repression is very specific (immunity to superinfection with the  same phage).<br />
                  <strong>3. Events  Leading to Termination of Lysogeny </strong><br />
			    Anytime  a lysogenic bacterium is exposed to adverse conditions, the lysogenic state can  be terminated. This process is called <strong>induction</strong>. Conditions which favor  the termination of the lysogenic state include: desiccation, exposure to UV or  ionizing radiation, exposure to mutagenic chemicals, etc. Adverse conditions  lead to the production of proteases (rec A protein) which destroy the repressor  protein. This in turn leads to the expression of the phage genes, reversal of  the integration process and lytic multiplication.</p>
				<p><img src="079" /></p>
				<p><strong>4. Lytic vs  Lysogenic Cycle </strong><br />
				  The  decision for lambda to enter the lytic or lysogenic cycle when it first enters  a cell is determined by the concentration of the repressor and another phage  protein called <strong>cro</strong> in the cell. The cro protein turns off the synthesis  of the repressor and thus prevents the establishment of lysogeny. Environmental  conditions that favor the production of cro will lead to the lytic cycle while  those that favor the production of the repressor will favor lysogeny.<br />
                  <strong> </strong><strong> </strong><img src="0710" /><br />
                  <strong>5.  Significance of Lysogeny </strong><br />
                  <strong>a. Model for animal virus transformation</strong> - Lysogeny is a model system for virus transformation of animal cells<br />
                  <strong>b. Lysogenic conversion</strong> - When a cell becomes lysogenized, occasionally extra genes carried by the  phage get expressed in the cell. These genes can change the properties of the  bacterial cell. This process is called lysogenic or phage conversion. This can  be of significance clinically. e.g. Lysogenic phages have been shown to carry  genes that can modify the Salmonella O antigen, which is one of the major  antigens to which the immune response is directed. Toxin production by  Corynebacterium diphtheriae is mediated by a gene carried by a phage. Only  those strain that have been converted by lysogeny are pathogenic.</p>
