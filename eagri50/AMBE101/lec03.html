				<p>The control of microbial  growth is necessary in many practical situations, and significant  advances in agriculture, medicine, and food science have been made through  study of this area of microbiology. The microorganisms are ubiquitous in nature. In order to study the nature and characteristics of a particular microbe,  it is essential to isolate  it from other contaminating  microorganisms. This can be achieved  by maintaining a completely  sterile environment in which the microbe of interest is selectively grown. It is necessary that not only the place you are working with microorganisms  should be free from contamination (other living organisms) but, the media and the materials you are using to handle and grow specific microorganisms should be free from  other microbial   contaminants.  For this  purpose ‘sterilization’ of the place of work materials  and media have to be done.<br />
“Control of  growth” as used here means to prevent the growth of microorganisms. This control is affected in two basic ways: (1) by killing microorganisms or (2) by inhibiting the growth of microorganisms. Control  of growth usually involves the use of physical or chemical agents which either  kill or prevent  the growth of microorganisms. Agents  which kill cells  are called <strong>cidal </strong>agents; agents which inhibit the growth of cells (without killing them) are referred to as <strong>static </strong>agents. Thus the term <strong>bactericidal </strong>refers to killing bacteria and  bacteriostatic<strong> refers</strong> to inhibiting the   growth  of bacterial cells. A <strong>bactericide </strong>kills bacteria; a <strong>fungicide </strong>kills fungi, and so  on.<br />
<strong>Sterilization </strong>is a process of complete removal or killing of all forms of  microbial   life including  spores from an object, surface,  medium or environment without  spoiling its nature.<br />
<strong>Methods</strong> <br />
There are various sterilization techniques available. However, several  factorsinfluence the effectiveness of  sterilization process like, the concentration of antimicrobial  agents, time and temperature of exposure, size of  population, type of contaminating  microbes etc.<br />
Sterilization is brought about by a combination of physical and chemical agents that adversely  affect the microorganisms either by causing  damage to the cell wall or cell  membrane or by inactivating the enzymes or by interfering with the synthesis of nucleic acids and protein.<br />
<strong>I. PHYSICAL AGENTS</strong> <br />
There are different types of physical agents.</p>
				<p>(i) <strong>Heat</strong>: The heat employed  for removal of micro-organisms varied with the nature of object and also depend on the purpose. Based on these different processes are employed.<br />
                    <strong>(a) Moist heat</strong> <br />
				  It is the widely used effective  means of sterilization process. In this, steam   under   high   pressure   is   employed   which imparts  high  penetration power resulting  in the hydration of cells and coagulation of protein leading to the death of the microorganism.  Autoclave is the apparatus  used for sterilization by moist heat.<br />
  <img width="282" height="172" src="lec03_clip_image002.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" />The autoclave is a double-jacketed steam chamber.  The chamber is equipped   with   a device  for generating saturated steam.  It can  be  maintained at a particular temperature and pressure for any period of time. During operation of autoclave the air  in the chamber is evacuated  by steam since presence of air will reduce the temperature in the chamber. The time  required for sterilization will depend  upon the materials to be  sterilized. Solid materials must be heated  for a longer time (1-2 hours)  while liquid media can be sterilized within  15-30 minutes. Also acidic materials  require shorter period than alkali materials. A temperature of 121°C for 15 min at a pressure of 15 lbs/ sq.inch is the sterilizing condition in the autoclave.<br />
  <strong>Advantages</strong><br />
				  Steam can penetrate through materials  and sterilization is achieved by the coagulation or denaturation of proteins  and other cell constituents.   Liquid  media, solid media, laboratory  equipments (cloth, glasswares, etc.,) can be sterilized. The temperature and pressure is high enough to kill spores, vegetative cells and  viruses.<br />
  <strong>Disadvantages</strong><br />
				  Temperature sensitive media, animal tissue  culture media, antibiotics, amino acids, cannot  be sterilized. Sometimes water may get inside incase of improper  packing.<br />
  <strong>(b) Dry heat</strong> <br />
				  This process is accomplished in a hot-air oven.  Hot air or dry heat is employed for sterilization. The dry heat penetrates substances  more slowly than the moist heat. Hence, the time required for effective  sterilization is long (2 to 3 hours) and also the temperature  required is too high (160°C -180°C).  Microbial death results from  the  oxidation of cell constituents.<br />
  <strong>Advantages</strong><br />
  <strong> </strong>Dry heat does not corrode glassware and metal instruments as moist heat does. All glassware’s can be sterilized.<br />
  <strong>Disadvantages</strong><br />
				  The sterilization process  is slow. It is not suitable for heat sensitive materials like many plastic and rubber items.<br />
  <strong>(c) Boiling</strong><strong> </strong>at 100°C for 30 minutes. Kills everything  except some endospores  (Actually, for the purposes of purifying drinking water 100o  for five minutes is probably adequate   though there  have been some reports that Giardia cysts can survive  this process). To kill endospores, and therefore <strong>sterilize </strong>the solution, very long or <strong>intermittent boiling </strong>is required.<br />
  <strong>(d) Pasteurization</strong><strong>  </strong>is  the  use  of  mild   heat  to  reduce  the  number  of microorganisms in a product or food. In the case of pasteurization of milk the  time and temperature depend on killing  potential pathogens that are transmitted in milk, <em>i.e.,  staphylococci, streptococci, Brucella  abortus </em>and <em>Mycobacterium  tuberculosis</em>. For pasteurization of  milk:<br />
				  batch method (Low temperature holding): 62.8oC for 30  minutes flash method (High temperature short time): 71.7oC for 15  seconds<br />
  <strong>(e) Intermittent sterilization or Tyndallization</strong><strong> </strong>is the process of boiling the materials at 100 oC for 30 min. successively  for three consecutive days. Destroys vegetative cells and spores;  germinated spores.<br />
  <strong>(f) Incineration</strong><strong> </strong>burns organisms  and physically destroys  them. Incineration is the complete burning of the material in to ashes.  Used for needles, inoculating  wires,   glassware, etc.  and  objects  not  destroyed  in  the incineration process. This is the direct  and ultimate method of destroying  cells. It is achieved by keeping the materials  directly in contact with the flame of Bunsen burner as a result all the microorganisms in the surface are  destroyed completely. Inoculating loops, needles and spreading rods are  sterilized by this method.<br />
  <strong>Advantages</strong>: Immediate and quick.<br />
  <strong>Disadvantages:</strong><strong> </strong>Cannot be used to sterilize  heat labile material, material is  lost by incineration.<br />

				<p><strong>(ii) Radiation</strong> <br />
				  Energy transmitted through space in a variety of forms is generally  called radiation. It is also known as &quot;cold sterilization&quot; as only little heat is produced during the process.  The most significant of this is electromagnetic  radiation.  The  energy  content  and  radiation   wavelength  are  inversely  proportional to each other. Radiation may be  ionizing or non-ionizing.<br />
  <strong>Ionizing radiation</strong> <br />
				  High-energy electron beams (Gamma, X-rays, alpha and beta particles)  have  sufficient energy to cause ionization of molecules. They drive away electrons and split   the molecules into ions. Water molecules are split into hydroxyl radicals (OH-), electrons and hydrogen ions (H+). OH- ions are highly  reactive  and   destructive  to  normal   cellular  compounds   such  as   DNA  and proteins. Thus ionizing radiations are used in sterilization.<br />
				  e.g<strong>. </strong>36Cs,  60Co<br />
  <strong>Advantages:</strong><strong> </strong>X-rays and Gamma rays have high penetrating power. Packed food and medical equipments are sterilized by using x-rays  and gamma rays.<br />
  <strong>Disadvantage:</strong><strong> </strong>Generating and controlling X-rays for sterilization is highly expensive.<br />
  <strong>Non-ionizing radiation</strong> <br />
				  This includes  ultraviolet (UV) rays. UV at a wavelength of 265 nm is  most bactericidal. Absorption      of  UV radiation produces    chemical modification of nucleoproteins i.e., thymine dimer formation that leads to misleading of genetic codes. This mutation  impairs the total functions of the organism, consequently causing its death.<br />
  <strong>Advantages</strong><br />
				  It  is used to maintain aseptic conditions in laminar air flow chamber, lab,  hospitals, pharmaceuticals, industries etc., and also in the sterilization of  water and air.<br />
  <strong>Disadvantage:</strong><br />
				  UV  radiation has very little ability to penetrate matter and hence the micro organisms  on the surface of an object are destroyed.<br />
  <strong>III)  Filtration</strong><br />
				  Filtration involves the passage of liquid or gas through  a screen like material that has spores small enough to retain the micro  organism of certain size. It is used to sterilize heat sensitive substance like  enzyme solutions, bacterial toxins, certain biological media, cell extract and  some sugars. Various types of filters are available in different grades of  porosity. Vacuum or pressure is required to move the solutes through the  filter.<br />
				  Involves the physical removal of all cells in aliquid or  gas, especially important to sterilize solutions which would be denatured by  heat (eg: antibiotics, injectable drugs, amino acids, vitamins etc.)<br />
  <strong>Advantages:</strong><br />
				  It  si the best way to reduce microbial population in solutions of heat sensitive  materials and it is sued to sterilize liquid media, vitamin solutions,  hormones, growth factors, enzymes.<br />
  <strong> Disadvantages</strong><br />
				  Pleomorphic  structures like mycoplasma cannot be effectively filtered by this technique. It  is applicable to sterilize only small quantities.<br />
  <strong>Commonly used filters in micro biology</strong><br />
				The sintered glass fliter is made of fused Jen or pyrex  glass, manufactured in such a way as to be porous, with apore size and  adsorptive charge sufficient to retain bacteria. The seitz filters are  compressed asbestos discs having porosity sufficiently small to retain  bacteria. Tye chamber land filters are made of porcelain. The mandler/berkfield  filters are made of diatomaceous earth. The membrane filter is a cellulose or nitrocellulose  membrane with apore size sufficiently small (0.01mm to 10 mm) to trap and  thereby remove bacterial from a liquid. The membrane filters are also used to  concentrate and trap the micro organisms in water and other liquids. HEPA (High  efficiency particulate air filters are of fibre galss filters for sterilization  of air.<br />
                <strong>Low  temperature</strong><br />
Most organisms grow very little or not at all at 0O  C. Store perishable foods at low temperatures to slow rate of growth and  consequent spoilage (eg: milk). Low temperatures are not bactericidal.  Psychrotrophs, rather tah  true  psychrophiles are the usual cause of food spoilage in refrigerated foods. <br />
<strong>Dessication /  Drying (removal of H2O)</strong><br />
Most micro organisms cannot grow at reduced water  activity (aw &lt; 0.90). Often used to preserve  foods (eg: fruits, grains etc). methods  involve removal of water from product by heat, evaporation, freeze drying,  addition of salt or sugar.<br />
<strong>Surface tension</strong> <br />
            is a property of the surface of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid" title="Liquid">liquid</a> that allows  it to resist an external force. It is revealed, for example, in floating of  some objects on the surface of water, even though they are denser than water,  and in the ability of some insects (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerridae" title="Gerridae">water striders</a>)  and even reptiles (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basiliscus_(genus)" title="Basiliscus (genus)">basilisk</a>) to run on the water surface. This  property is caused by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(chemistry)" title="Cohesion (chemistry)">cohesion</a> of like molecules, and is responsible  for many of the behaviors of liquids.<br />
Surface tension has the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis" title="Dimensional analysis">dimension</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force" title="Force">force</a> per unit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length" title="Length">length</a>, or of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a> per unit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area" title="Area">area</a>. The two are  equivalent—but when referring to energy per unit of area, people use the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_energy" title="Surface energy">surface energy</a>—which  is a more general term in the sense that it applies also to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid" title="Solid">solids</a> and not just  liquids.<br />
In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science" title="Materials science">materials science</a>,  surface tension is used for either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_stress" title="Surface stress">surface stress</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_energy" title="Surface energy">surface free  energy</a><br />
<strong>Osmotic pressure  –</strong> plasmolysis/ plasmotysis<br />
            Is the process in plant cells where the plasma membrane pulls away from the  cell wall due to the loss of water through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis" title="Osmosis">osmosis</a>.  The reverse process, cytolysis, can occur if the cell is in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonicity#Hypotonicity" title="Tonicity">hypotonic</a> solution resulting in a higher external <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_pressure" title="Osmotic pressure">osmotic pressure</a> and a net flow of water into the cell. Through observation of plasmolysis and  deplasmolysis it is possible to determine the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonicity" title="Tonicity">tonicity</a> of the cell's environment as well as the rate solute molecules cross the  cellular membrane. <br />
<strong>Chemical  agents</strong><br />
Chemical that is used to kill or inhibit the growth and  development of micro organisms are called anti microbial agents. Disinfectants  and antiseptics come under anti microbial agents and are usually used on  inanimate materials. The mechanism of action is complex and non specific. It  may act on lipid portion of cell membrane, oxidize or reduce an important  functional group of an enzyme, prevent certain bio synthesis or cause extensive  breakdown of DNA.<br />
<strong>Types of  microbial agents</strong><br />
<strong>Chemical  sterilants</strong><br />
Chemical sterilants are chemical anti microbial agents  that are usd fro sterilization of heat sensitive substance/ materials. Normally  plastic petriplates and medical supplies such as blood transfusion sets,  plastic syringes, lenses etc. could be sterilized even in packets or bundles  using ethylene oxide, formaldehyde or formalin is effectively used to sterilize  enclosed areas/a septic chambers at 22 O C with a relative humidity  of 60 – 80 %.<br />
<strong>Antispetics</strong><br />
Microbicidal agents harmless enough to be applied to the  skin and mucous membrane, should not be taken internally. Eg: mercurails,  silver nitrate, iodine solution, alcohols, detergents.<br />
<strong>Disinfectants</strong><br />
Agents that kill micro organisms, but not necessary their  spores, not safe for application to living tissues, they are used on inanimate  objects such as tables, floors, utensils etc. eg: Chlorine, hypochlorites,  chlorine compounds, Lysol, copper sulfate, quaternary ammonium compounds<strong>.</strong><br />
<strong>Phenol</strong><br />
Derivative of phenol like benzyl resorcinol, o-cresol,  m-cresol, etc., are used as effective disinfectants 5% aqueous solutions of  phenols are used as disinfectant. It alters the protein structure and leads to  denaturation of proteins and enzymes. Also affects permeability of cytoplasmic  membrane. They readily kill vegetative cells of bacteria and fungi but for  spores.<br />
<strong>Alcohol</strong><br />
Alcohol at 70% concentration is more effective. It brings  about denaturation and coagulation of protein. Ethanol is routinely used in  laboratories to surface sterilize worktables and hands of the researcher/  experiment.<br />
<strong>Halogens</strong><br />
Halogens such as hypocholrites, choramines and povidone-  iodine are used to sanitize utensils, surface sterilize in animate objects,  table surfaces and other instruments.<br />
<strong>Heavy metals</strong><br />
Heavy metals such as mercuric chloride are also used for  surface sterilization purposes. Heavy metals acts as oxidizing agents and kill  the micro organisms on the surface of the object. Usually 0.1 % mercuric  chloride is used in the laboratories to sterilize the surface of worktable and  explants.<br />
<strong>Detergents</strong><br />
Detergents are those compounds that make water repellant  surfaces more wettable. There are two types of detergents viz., ionic and non  ionic. Detergent soaps and other synthetic detergents are used for  washing/cleaning glass wares, table tops etc.,</p>

				<p><strong>Chemotherapeutic  agents</strong><br />
				  Antimicrobial agents of synthetic origin useful in the  treatment of microbial or viral disease. Examples: sulfonilamides, isoniazid,  ethambutol, AZT, chloramphenicol. <br />
  <strong>Antibiotics</strong><br />
				  Antimicrobial agents produced by micro organisms that  kill or inhibit other micro organisms. This is the microbiologist’s definition.  A more broadened definition of an antibiotic includes many chemical of natural  origin which has the effect to kill pr inhibit the growth of other types cells.  Since most clinically useful anti biotics are produced by micro organisms and  are used to kill or inhibit infectious bacteria we follow classic definition.<br />
				  Antibiotics are low molecular weight (non- protein)  molecules produced as secondary metabolites, mainly by micro organisms that  live in the soil. Most of these micro organisms form some type of a spore or  other dormant cell, and there is thought to be some relationship between anti  biotic production and the process of sporulation. Among the molds, the notable  antibiotic producers are penicillium and cephalosporium, which are the main source  of the beta lactam antibiotics. In the bacteria, the actinomycetes, notable  streptomyces species, produce a variety of types of anti biotics including the  aminoglycosides (eg: streptomycin), macrolides (eg: erythromycin) and  the tetracycline. Endospore forming bacillus  species produce polypeptide anti biotics such as polymyxin and bactracin.</p>
