				<p><strong>Principles of Food Preservation</strong><br />
          A  good method of food preservation is one that slows down or prevents altogether  the action of the agents of spoilage. Also, during the process of food  preservation, the food should not be damaged. In order to achieve this, certain  basic methods were applied on different types of foods. For example in earlier  days, in very cold weather condition, ice was used to preserve foods. Thus,  very low temperature became an efficient method for preventing food spoilage.  Let us now list the principles of food preservation. <br />
<strong>1. Removal of micro-organisms or inactivating  them: </strong>This is done by removing air, water  (moisture), lowering or increasing temperature, increasing the concentration of  salt or sugar or acid in foods. If you want to preserve green leafy vegetables,  you have to remove the water from the leaves so that micro organisms cannot  survive. You do this by drying the green leaves till all the moisture  evaporates.<br />
<strong>2. Inactivating enzymes: </strong>Enzymes  found in foods can be inactivated by changing their conditions such as  temperature and moisture, when you preserve peas, one of the methods of  preservations is to put them for a few minutes in boiling water. This method  also known as blanching inactivates enzymes and thus, helps in preserving the  food. <br />
<strong>3. Removal of insects, worms and rats: </strong>By storing  foods in dry, air tight containers the insects, worms or rats are prevented  from destroying it.<br />

				<p><strong>PRESERVATION BY USING CHEMICALS</strong><br />
				  A preservative is defined as only  substance which is capable of inhibiting, retarding or arresting the growth of  microorganisms. <br />
				  Microbial  spoilage of food products is also controlled by using chemical preservatives.  The inhibitory action of preservatives is due to their interfering with the  mechanism of cell division, permeability of cell membrane and activity of  enzymes.<br />
				  Pasteurized squashes, cordials and crushes have a cooked  flavour. After the container is opened, they ferment and spoil within a short  period, particularly in a tropical climate.   To avoid this, it is necessary to use chemical preservatives. Chemically  preserved squashes and crushes can be kept for a fairly long time even after  opening the seal of the bottle. It is however, essential that the use of  chemicals is properly controlled, as their indiscriminate use is likely to be  harmful. The preservative used should not be injurious to health and should be  non-irritant. It should be easy to detect and estimate.<br />
				  Two important chemical preservatives are permitted to  beverages according to the FPO (1955).<br />
				  1. Sulphur dioxide and<br />
				  2. Benzoic acid<br />
  <strong>SULPHUR DIOXIDE </strong><br />
				  It is widely used throughout the  world in the preservation of juice, pulp, nectar, squash, crush, cordial and  other products. It has good preserving action against bacteria and moulds and  inhibits enzymes, etc.  In addition, it  acts as an antioxidant and bleaching agent. These properties help in the  retention of ascorbic acid, carotene and other oxidizable compounds. It also  retards the development of nonenzymatic browning or discolouration of the  product. It is generally used in the form of its salts such as sulphite,  bisulphate and metabisulphite.<br />
				  Potassium metabisulphite (K2O  2So2 (or) K2S2O5) is commonly used as a stable  source of So2. Being a solid, it is easier to use than liquid (or) gaseous  So2.It is fairly stable in neutral (or) alkaline media but decomposed by weak  acids like carbonic, citric, tartaric acid and malic acids. When added to fruit  juice (or) squash it reacts with the acid in the juice forming the potassium  salt and So2, which is liberated and forms sulphurous acid with the water of  the juice. The reactions involved are as follows     </p>
				<p>Potassium                                     Potassium        Sulphur<br />
				  Meta  bisulphate + Citric acid ®   Citrate        + dioxide   + H­2O</p>
				<p>                    SO2 + H2O ®  H2SO3 (Sulphurous acid) </p>
				<p>            SO2 has a better preservative action  than sodium benzoate against bacteria and moulds. It also retards the  development of yeasts in juice, but cannot arrest their multiplication, once  their number has reached a high value.<br />
				  It is well known that fruit juices  with high acidity do not undergo fermentation readily. The preservative action  of the fruit acid its due to is hydrogen ion concentration. The pH for the  growth of moulds ranges from 1.5 to 8.5, that of yeasts from 2.5-8.0, and of  bacteria from 4.0 to 7.5.As fruit beverage like citrus squashes and cordials  have generally a pH of 2.5 to 3.5, the growth of moulds and yeasts in them  cannot be prevented by acidity alone. Bacteria, however, cannot grow. The pH is  therefore, of great importance in the preservation of food product and by  regulating it, one or more kinds of microorganisms in the beverage can be  eliminated. <br />
				  The concentration of So2 required  preventing the growth of mirgroorganism at different pH levels are as under.</p>

                </table>
				<p>            The toxicity of So2 increases at  high temperature. Hence its effectiveness depends on the acidity, pH,  temperature and substances present in fruit juice.<br />
				  According to FPO, the maximum amount  of So2 allowed in fruit juice is 700 ppm, in squash, crush and cordial 350 ppm  and in RTS and nectar 100 ppm. The advantages of using So2 are  a) It has a better preserving action than  sodium benzoate against bacterial fermentation b) it helps to retain the colour  of the beverage for a longer time than sodium benzoate ( c) being a gas, it  helps in preserving the surface layer of juices also (d) being highly soluble  in juices and squashes, it ensures better mixing and hence their preservation  and (e) any excess of So2 present can be removed either by heating the juice to  about 71oC or by passing air through it or by subjecting the juice  to vacuum. This causes some loss of the flavouring materials due to  volatilization, which can be compensated by adding flavours.<br />
  <strong>Disadvantages (or) limitations</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>It cannot be used in the  case of some naturally coloured juices like those of jamun, pomegranate,  strawberry, coloured grapes, plum etc. on account of its bleaching action.</li>
				  <li>It cannot also be used for  juices which are to be packed in tin containers because it not only corrodes  the tin causing pinholes, but also forms H2S which has a  disagreeable smell and reacts with the iron of the tin container to form a  black compound, both of which are highly undesirable and </li>
				  <li>So2 gives a slight taste and  colour to freshly prepared beverages but these are not serious defects if the  beverage is diluted before drinking.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>II. Benzoic acid</strong><br />
				  It is only partially soluble in H2O  hence its salt, sodium benzoate is used. One part of sodium benzoate is soluble  in 1.8 parts of water at ordinary temperature, whereas only 0.34 parts of  benzoic acid is soluble in 100 parts of water. Sodium benzoate is thus nearly  170 times as soluble as benzoic acid, pure sodium benzoate is tasteless and  odourless.<br />
				  The antibacterial action of benzoic  acid is increased in the presence of Co2 and acid e.g. <em>Bacillus  subtilis</em> cannot survive in benzoic acid solution in the presence of Co2.  Benzoic acid is more effective against yeasts than against moulds. It does not  stop lactic acid and acetic acid fermentation.<br />
				  The quantity of benzoic acid  required depends on the nature of the product to be preserved, particularly its  acidity. In case of juices having a pH of 3.5-4.0, which is the range of a  majority of fruit juices, addition of 0.06 to 0.10% of sodium benzoate has been  found to be sufficient. In case of less acid juices such as grape juice atleast  0.3% is necessary. The action of benzoic acid is reduced considerably at pH  5.0. Sodium benzoate is excess of 0.1% may produce a disagreeable burning  taste. According to FPO its permitted level in RTS and nectar is 100 ppm and in  squash, crush and cordial 600 ppm.<br />
				  In the long run benzoic acid may  darken the product. It is, therefore, mostly used in coloured products of  tomato, jamun, pomegranate, plum, watermelon, strawberry, coloured grapes etc.<br />
  <strong>Preservation by Using Radiation</strong><br />
				  Radiation  may be defined as the emission and propagation of energy through space or through  a material medium. The type of radiation of primary interest in food  preservation is electromagnetic.<br />
				  Initially,  the destruction of microorganisms in foods by ionizing radiation was referred  to by terminology brought over from heat and chemical destruction of  microorganisms. Although microorganisms can indeed be destroyed by chemicals,  heat, and radiation, there is, nevertheless, a lack of precision in the use of  this terminology for radiation-treated foods. Consequently, in 1964 an  international group of microbiologists suggested the following terminology for  radiation treatment of foods.24<br />
  <strong>Radappertization</strong><br />
  <strong></strong>Is  equivalent to radiation sterilization or &quot;commercial sterility,&quot; as  it is understood in the canning industry. Typical levels of irradiation are  3(MK) kGy.<br />
  <strong>Radicidation</strong><br />
  <strong></strong>Is  equivalent to pasteurization— of milk, for example. Specifically, it refers to  the reduction of the number of viable specific nonspore-<br />
				  forming pathogens, other than viruses, so that  none is detectable by any standard method. Typical levels to achieve this  process are 2.5-10 kGy.<br />
  <strong>Radurization </strong><br />
				  May be  considered equivalent to pasteurization. It refers to the enhancement of the  keeping quality of a food by causing substantial reduction in the numbers of  viable specific spoilage microbes by radiation. Common dose levels are 0.75-2.5  kGy for fresh meats, poultry, seafood, fruits, vegetables, and cereal grains.<br />
  <strong>Radappertization</strong><br />
				  Radappertization  of any foods may be achieved by application of the proper dose of radiation  under the proper conditions. <br />
  <strong>Preservation by Using High temperature</strong><br />
				  The use of  high temperatures to preserve food is based on their destructive effects on  microorganisms.<br />
				  By high temperatures are meant any and all  temperatures above ambient. With respect to food preservation, there are two  temperature categories in common use: pasteurization  and sterilization.<br />
  <strong> Pasteurization:</strong> by use of  heat implies either the destruction of all disease-producing organisms (for  example, pasteurization of milk) or the destruction or reduction in the number of  spoilage organisms in certain foods, as in the pasteurization of vinegar. The  pasteurization of milk is achieved by heating as follows:<br />
				  145°F  (63°C) for 30 minutes (low temperature, long time [LTLT]) 1610F (72°C) for 15  seconds (primary high temperature, short time [HTST] method) 191°F(89°C) for  1.0 second, 194°F (900C) for 0.5 second, 201°F(94°C)for0.1 second, 212°F  (1000C) for 0.01 second. These treatments are equivalent and are sufficient to  destroy the most heat resistant of the nonspore- forming pathogenic organisms—<em>Mycobacterium</em> <em>tuberculosis </em>and <em>Coxiella burnetii.</em> When six different strains of <em>M. paratuberculosis</em> were added to milk at levels from 40 to 100,000  colony-forming units (cfu)/mL followed by pasteurization by LTLT or HTST, no  survivors survivors were detected on suitable culture media incubated for 4  months. Milk pasteurization temperatures are sufficient to destroy, in  addition, all yeasts, molds, gram negative bacteria, and many gram positives.  The two groups of organisms that survive milk pasteurization are placed into  one of two groups: thermodurics and thermophiles. Thermoduric organisms are  those that can survive exposure to relatively high temperatures but do not  necessarily grow at these temperatures. The nonsporeforming organisms that  survive milk pasteurization generally belong to the genera <em>Streptococcus </em>and <em>Lactobacillus, </em>and sometimes to other genera. Thermophilic organisms are  those that not only survive relatively high temperatures but <em>require </em>high  temperatures for their growth and metabolic activities. The genera <em>Bacillus</em> and <em>Clostridium </em>contain the thermophiles of greatest importance in  foods. Pasteurization (to destroy spoilage biota) of beers in the brewing  industry is carried out usually for 8-15 minutes at 600C. <br />
  <strong>Sterilization:</strong> means the  destruction of all viable organisms as may be measured by an appropriate  plating or enumerating technique. Canned foods are sometimes called  &quot;commercially sterile&quot; to indicate that no viable organisms can be  detected by the usual cultural methods employed or that the number of survivors  is so low as to be of no significance under the conditions of canning and  storage. Also, microorganisms may be present in canned foods that cannot grow  in the product by reason of undesirable pH, oxidation-reduction potential (Eh),  or temperature of storage.<br />
  <strong>Preservation by Using Low temperature</strong><br />
				  The  use of low temperatures to preserve foods is based on the fact that the  activities of food borne microorganisms can be slowed at temperatures above  freezing and generally stopped at subfreezing temperatures. The reason is that all  metabolic reactions of microorganisms are enzyme catalyzed and that the rate of  enzyme catalyzed reactions is dependent on temperature.<br />
				  With a rise in temperature, there is an  increase in reaction rate. The temperature coefficient <em>(Q10)</em> may be  generally defined as follows:<br />
				  </p>
				<p><img src="6494" /><br />
				  The <em>Qi0 </em>for most biological systems  is 1.5-2.5, so that for each 100C rise in temperature within the suitable  range, there is a twofold increase in the rate of reaction. For every 100C  decrease in temperature, the reverse is true.<br />
				  The term <em>psychrophile </em>was coined  by Schmidt- Nielsen in 1902 for microorganisms that grow at O0C.30 This term is  now applied to organisms that grow over the range of subzero to 200C, with an  optimum range of 10-150C.44 Around 1960,<br />
				  the term <em>psychrotroph  (psychros, </em>cold, and <em>trephein, </em>to nourish or to develop) was  suggested for organisms able to grow at 5°C or below.1147 It is now widely  accepted among food microbiologists that a psychrotroph is an organism that can  grow at temperatures between 00C and 7°C and produce visible colonies (or  turbidity) within 7-10 days. Because some psychrotrophs can grow at  temperatures at least as high as 430C, they are, in fact, <em>mesophiles. </em>By  these definitions, psychrophiles would be expected to occur only on products  from oceanic waters or from extremely cold climes. The organisms that cause the  spoilage of meats, poultry, and vegetables in the 0-50C range would be expected  to be<br />

				<p><strong>Methods of freezing</strong><br />
                    <strong>There are various methods of freezing</strong><br />
                    <strong>1. Sharp Freezing (Slow freezing)</strong><br />
				  This  technique, first used in 1861, involves freezing by circulation of air, either  naturally or with the aid of fans. The temperature may vary from –15 to –29oC  and freezing may take from 3 to 72 hours. The ice crystals formed one large and  rupture the cells. The thawed tissue cannot regain its original water content.  The first products to be sharp frozen were meat and butter. Now-a-days freezer  rooms are maintained at –23 to –29oC or even lower, in contrast to  the earlier temperature of –18oC.<br />
  <strong>2. Quick freezing  </strong><br />
				  In  this process the food attains the temperature of maximum ice crystal formation  (0 to – 4oC) in 30 min or less. Such a speed results in formation of  very small ice crystals and hence minimum disturbance of cell structure. Most  foods are quick frozen by one of the following three methods:<br />
  <strong>a) By direct immersion</strong><br />
				  Since  liquids are good heat conductors food can be frozen rapidly by direct immersion  in a liquid such as brine or sugar solution at low temperature. Berries in  sugar solution packed fruit juices and concentrates are frozen in this manner.  The refrigeration medium must be edible and capable of remaining unfrozen at  –18oC and slightly below. Direct immersion equipments such as  ottenson Brine freezer, Zarotschenzeff ‘Fog’ freezer, T.V.A. freezer, Bartlett  freezer etc. of commercial importance earlier are not used today.<br />
  <strong>Advantages  </strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>There is perfect contact  between the refrigerating medium and the product, hence the rate of heat  transfer is very high.</li>
				  <li>Fruits are frozen with a  coating of syrup which preserves the colour and flavour during storage. </li>
				  <li>The frozen product is not a  solid block because each piece is separate.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Disadvantages </strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Brine is a good  refrigerating medium but it cannot be used for fruits.</li>
				  <li>It is difficult to make a  syrup that will not become viscous at low temperature.</li>
				  <li>The refrigeration  temperature must be carefully controlled, as at high temperature the medium  will enter the product by osmosis and at low temperature the medium may freeze  solid.</li>
				  <li>It is very difficult to  maintain the medium at a definite concentration and also to keep it free from  dirt and contamination.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>b) By indirect contact with refrigerant</strong><br />
				  Indirect  freeing may be defined as freezing by contact of the product with a metal  surface which is itself cooled by freezing brine or other refrigerating media.  This is an old method of freezing in which the food or package is kept in  contact with the passage through the refrigerant at –18 to -46oC  flows. Knowles Automatic Package feezer, Patterson continuous plate freezer,  FMC continuous can freezer and Birds eye freezers are based on this principle.<br />
  <strong>c)&nbsp;By air blast</strong><br />
				  In  this method, refrigerated air at –18 to –34oC is blown across the  material to be frozen. The advantages claimed for quick freezing over slow  freezing (sharp freezing) are  (1)  smaller (size) ice crystals are formed, hence there is less mechanical  destruction of intact cells of the food (2) period for ice formation is  shorter, therefore, there is less time for diffusion of soluble material and  for separation of ice (3) more rapid preservation of microbial growth and (4)  more rapid slowing down of enzyme action.<br />
  <strong>3) Cryogenic freezing</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>Although most foods retain their  quality when quick frozen by the above methods, a few require ultrafast  freezing. Such materials are subjected to cryogenic freezing which is defined  as freezing at very low temperature (below –60oC). The refrigerant  used at present in cryogenic freeing are liquid nitrogen and liquid CO2.  In the former case, freezing may be achieved by immersion in the liquid,  spraying of liquid or circulation of its vapour over the product to be frozen.<br />
  <strong>4.&nbsp;Dehydro-freezing</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>This is a process where  freezing is proceded by partial dehydration. In case of some fruits and  vegetables about 50% of the moisture is removed by dehydration prior to  freezing. This has been found to improve the quality of the food. Dehydration  does not cause deterioration and dehydro frozen foods are relatively more  stable.<br />
  <strong>5.&nbsp;Freeze drying</strong><br />
				  In  this process food is first frozen at –18oC on trays in the lower  chamber of a freeze drier and the frozen material dried (initially at 30oC  for 24 hrs and then at 20oC). Under high vacuum (0.1 mm Hg) in the  upper chamber. Direct sublimation of the ice takes place without passing  through the intermediate liquid stage. The product is highly hygroscopic,  excellent in taste and flavour and can be reconstituted readily. Mango pulp,  orange juice concentrate, passion fruit juice and guava pulp are dehyderated by  this method.</p>
