				<p>Microbes  are an integral part of soil and contribute to soil and plant health.  Microorganisms have the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, solubilize and  mobilize phosphorus, produce antibiotics and disease suppressing molecules.  Owing to these properties, they are used in agriculture as biofertilizers and  biopesticides. They are also important in the treatment of solid waste and  sewage. They clean up the environment by degradation of several pollutants like  pesticides, hydrocarbons, dyes and paints. They also help in the enhanced  recovery of oil and metals from low grade ores or aqueous streams.<br />
				  Man  is a host to variety of pathogenic bacteria, protozoa and viruses. They can  cause various infectious and non-infectious diseases. In order to control the  disease and its transmission, it is essential to isolate and identify the  causal agent from blood, sputum, urine, stool or pus. Various cultural and  molecular methods can be employed for identification of pathogen. Sterilization  techniques, use of disinfectants and vaccination can help control transmission  of disease.<br />
  <strong>Biofertilizers </strong><br />
				  Biofetilizers  are the products containing living cells of different types of microorganisms  that enrich the nutrient quality of soil. The main sources of biofertilizers  are bacteria, fungi and cyanobacteria (blue green algae). Most biofertilizers  belong to one of the following categories: nitrogen fixing, phosphate  solubilizing and mobilizing, and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria. Some of  the major biofertilizers and target crops are given in table 8.1. Nitrogen  fixing biofertilizers fix atmospheric nitrogen into forms which are readily  useable by plants. These include <em>Rhizobium</em>, <em>Azospirillum</em>, <em>Azotobacter</em>, blue green algae and <em>Azolla</em>. While <em>Rhizobium </em>requires  symbiotic association with the root nodules of legumes to fix nitrogen, others  can fix nitrogen independently. Phosphate solubilizing microorganisms secrete  organic acids that enhance the uptake of phosphorus by plants by dissolving  rock phosphate and tricalcium phosphate. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are the  most common phosphorus mobilising types that are omnipresent. A group of  bacteria that enhance the growth of plant through nitrogen fixation, phosphorus  solubilization or production of plant growth promoting metabolites are known as  Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR). Many PGPR strains have a potential  to be used as microbial inoculants to enhance crop productivity.<br />

				<p>            The  growth in agricultural production in the last three decades has been  accompanied by a sharp increase in the use of chemical fertilizers, causing  serious concern. Foremost among these concerns is the effect of excessive  fertilizers on the quality of soil and ground water. The use of environmental  friendly biofertilizers can cut down the use of chemical fertilizers.  Biofertilizers have definite advantage over chemical fertilizers. It is  economical to use biofertilizers as they are a cheap source of nutrients when  compared to chemical fertilizers. Biofertilisers in addition to nitrogen and phosphorus,  also provides certain growth promoting substances like hormones, vitamins, and  amino acids that improves the plant health and vigour. Continuous use of  chemical fertilisers adversely affects the soil structure whereas  biofertilizers when applied to soil improve the soil structure. The chemical  fertilizers are toxic at higher doses where as biofertilizers have no toxic  effects.<br />
                    <strong>Nitrogen fixing bacteria</strong>       <strong></strong><br />
				  An atmosphere around  us contains nearly 78% nitrogen that is in free form and is not utilized by the  plants. Plants take up nitrogen in the form of ammonia or nitrate. Relatively  small amount of ammonia is produced by lightning. Some ammonia also is produced  industrially by the Haber-Bosch process, using an iron-based catalyst, very  high pressures and fairly high temperature. But the major conversion of N2  into ammonia by the action of enzyme nitrogenase, and thence into proteins, is  achieved by microorganisms in the process called nitrogen fixation (or  dinitrogen fixation). <br />
				  All  the nitrogen-fixing organisms are prokaryotes. There are different groups of  nitrogen fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs) present in the nature. These are  broadly divided into three categories, viz., </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Symbiotic  microorganism </li>
				  <li>Asymbiotic  or free living </li>
				  <li>Associative  Symbiosis</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>Examples  of nitrogen fixing microorganisms for each category are given in table <br />

				<p>The  list of nitogen fixing bacteria is long but here we will discuss some of the  important types of biofertilisers that can be considered for agrobased  industries. </p>
				<p><strong>RHIZOBIUM   INOCULANT</strong></p>
				<p>The bacteria of the genera <em>Rhizobium</em>, <em>Bradyrhizobium</em>, <em>Mesorhizobium</em>, <em>Sinorhizobium </em>and <em>Azorhizobium</em> collectively known as  rhizobia, in symbiotic association with leguminous plants reduce atmospheric  nitrogen. The rhizobial colonies appear raised, wet, shining, translucent or  opaque with smooth margin on yeast extract mannitol agar (YEMA) medium. The  legume-rhizobia symbiosis culminates in the formation nitrogen fixing root or  stem nodules. These unique structures are agronomically significant as they  provide alternative to the use of energy-expensive ammonium fertilizer. Not all  legumes fix nitrogen. Of the three segregate families of legumes, the capacity  to form nodules appear to be absent from the majority of species of  Caesalpiniaceae. All members of family Mimosaceae and Fabaceae show formation  of nodules with rhizobia. It is believed that legume-<em>Rhizobium</em> symbiosis contributes atleast 70 million metric tons N  per year. The amount of nitrogen fixed varies with the strain of <em>Rhizobium</em>, the plant species and  environmental conditions.</p>

                  The  taxonomy of root and stem nodulating bacteria is in a state of transition. The  initial classification of these organisms based on plant infection into 7 cross  inoculation groups has been abandoned after extensive criticism. A new system  of classification was proposed by Jordan (1984) in Bergey's Manual of  Systematic Bacteriology (Table ). He separated the root nodule bacteria into  two genera, <em>Rhizobium</em> and <em>Bradyrhizobium</em>, based on data on  numerical taxonomy, molecular characteristics and rate of growth on laboratory  media. Fast growing strains were placed under genus <em>Rhizobium</em> whereas slow growing strains were placed in <em>Bradyrhizobium</em>. Since 1984, the  classification has undergone lot of changes. Three additional genera, <em>Mesorhizobium</em>, <em>Sinorhizobium</em> and <em>Azorhizobium</em> have been recognised and many new species have been reported so far. <br />
                  <strong><em>Rhizobium</em></strong><strong> inoculation</strong><br />
                Legume  inoculation is a significant strategy for the manipulation of rhizobial  microflora and improving crop productivity and soil fertility.  However, in tropical soils where there is  presence of adequate native rhizobia and high levels of mineral N, legume  inoculation often fails.  Thus there is  an urgency to identify conditions where inoculation is needed.  Different diagnostic measures to decide about  inoculation have been suggested by various workers.  Inoculation should be carried out if;</p>
				<ol>
                  <li>population  density of species-specific rhizobia is low,</li>
                  <li>the  same or symbiotically related legume is not grown in the area in the immediate  past history</li>
                  <li>waste-lands  have to be reclaimed</li>
                  <li>legume  follows a non leguminous crop in a rotation</li>
                  <li>soil  is poor in mineral N (nitrate)</li>
                  <li>soils  are acidic, alkaline and saline.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Selection of rhizobial strains for inoculant production</strong><br />
                  A  large-scale screening should be carried out to identify ideal inoculant strain  for different legume crops.  The  criterion for selection may vary for particular soil types like acidic, sodic,  saline, nitrate-rich or heavy metal contaminated. Following are some of the  desirable characters for a strain to be fit for use in commercial inoculants:<br />
                  1.         Ability  to form nodules and fix N on the target legume<br />
                  2.         Ability  to compete in nodule formation with populations of native rhizobia present in  the soil.<br />
                  3.         Ability  to fix N across a range of environmental conditions;<br />
                  4.         Ability  to grow well in artificial media, in inoculant carrier and in the soil<br />
                  5.         Ability  to persist in soil, particularly for annually regenerating legumes<br />
                  6.         Ability  to migrate from the initial site of inoculation<br />
                  7.         Ability  to colonize the soil in the absence of a legume host<br />
                  8.         Ability  to tolerate environmental stresses;<br />
                  9.         Ability  to fix N with a wide range of host genotypes;<br />
                  10.       Genetic  stability<br />
                  11.       Compatibility  with agrochemicals.<br />
  <strong>Inoculant production            </strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Propagation</strong> </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Rhizobia are not very  particular in their nutritional requirements.   Yeast-extract mannitol (YEM) medium is commonly employed for culturing  of rhizobia.  For commercial production  of cultures, cheaper sources like sucrose, molasses and corn steep liquor can  be used.<br />
                  Mass scale  propagation of rhizobia can be carried out using system of rotary shaker or  fermentor.  In shake flask culture, broth  is raised in flasks with agitation by circular motion of rotary shaker.  Fermentors are used for industrial scale  production of bio-fertilizers.  Culture  vessels ranging from 5 to 1000 L can be used depending upon the  requirement.  The amount of inoculum  culture to be added into the fermenter vessel depends on the size of the  fermentors, but the ratio between the inoculum and the medium in the vessel  should be maintained at 1:20 (5% inoculum rate).  The broth is continuously aerated by forcing  sterile air through porous stainless steel sparger.  Various fermentation requirements like  aeration, agitation and fermentation time vary from strain to strain.  Table gives the optimum fermentation  conditions for mass multiplication of rhizobial strains.</p>
                <p>When the number of  rhizobia in the broth has attained the required standard (108-109  cells ml-1) the broth should be added to the carrier for preparation  of carrier-based inoculant.<br />

                <p>The medium in which  rhizobia are allowed to multiply is an important factor in rhizobial culture  preparation.  The term 'carrier' is  generally used for a medium that carries the live microorganisms.  As per BIS specification, the carrier should  be in powder form and capable of passing through 150-212 micron (72-100 mesh)  IS sieve.  A good carrier material should</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>have  high water holding capacity</li>
                  <li>be  non-toxic to rhizobia</li>
                  <li>be  easy to sterilize by autoclaving or gamma irradiation </li>
                  <li>be  readily and inexpensively available</li>
                  <li>provide  good adhesion to seed</li>
                  <li>have  pH buffering capacity</li>
                  <li>have  cation and/or anion exchange capacity.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In India, different  carrier materials like peat, liginite, charcoal, rice husk, pressmud,  vermiculite, soil and coir dust has been employed. Although peat is the  favoured base for inoculants world over, in India high quality peat is not  available. A mixture of charcoal and soil in ratio of 3:1 is most commonly used  as a carrier material. The preparation of charcoal based carrier is given  below.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The carrier material is sun  dried up to a moisture level of 5%. The material is ground to a desired  fineness preferably to pass 100-200 mesh sieves.</li>
                  <li>The carriers are mixed with  finely powdered calcium carbonate to neutralize if they are acidic. To make  charcoal more suitable for the multiplication of rhizobia, CaCO3 @  1%, KHPO4 @ 0.5% and soil @ 25% are mixed thoroughly  with it. Finally the carrier is mixed with 10% water before sterilization.</li>
                  <li>The pretreated carrier is  sterilized in an autoclave at 15 lb psi for 3-4 hr continuously.</li>
                  <li>Broth culture of <em>Rhizobium</em> containing 109  cells mL-1 is added to one-third of the water holding capacity of  the carrier.</li>
                  <li><strong>Curing</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>In manufacturing  inoculants, a period of &quot;curing&quot; (maturation) after addition of broth  culture to carrier improves the quality of the product. After mixing the  carrier with the broth culture raw-blended carrier is kept for 24 hours for  curing. During  this time the rhizobia  get acclimatized with the carrier.<br />
                    <strong>d)  Packing</strong><br />
                  After  curing, the inoculant is packed in polyethylene bags (high density; 0.075 -  0.090 mm) or polypropylene bags.  The  packing material should have the following properties:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>should be stable towards  gamma irradiation</li>
                  <li>should be autoclavable</li>
                  <li>should have high gas  exchange capacity</li>
                  <li>should not allow high rates  of moisture loss</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>e) Incubation and storage</strong><br />
                  Inoculants must be  incubated for a week in a room with an ambient temperature ranging from 25-30oC.  During this period the bacterium multiplies  and reaches to a required standard.  The  packets may then be stored in a cold room (4o-15oC) till  its use.<br />
  <strong>Inoculant quality control</strong><br />
                  The  quality of rhizobial inoculants is of great importance in ensuring field  performance as well as for the commercial prospects of inoculant industry.  Basically, quality means the presence of the  right type of micro-organism in active form and desired numbers. Evaluation of  inoculant quality by enumeration of viable rhizobia is an accurate index of  inoculating potential. Numerical considerations are of such significance in  determining quality of inoculant products and their success in field that the  necessity for quality control systems has been recognized in various countries.  In India, Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)  (formerly ISI) listed the Indian standard specifications for <em>Rhizobium</em> inoculants in 1977 (IS:  8268-1976).  This was revised in 1986  (ISI 1986).  These specifications are  given in Table. <br />

  <strong>Application of inoculants</strong><br />
                  The major goal of legume inoculation is to  introduce efficient and competitive strains in large numbers that can survive  and establish in the legume rhizosphere and colonize the roots promptly.  Application of inoculant to the seed surface  prior to sowing is the traditional, most commonly used and most user-friendly  means of inoculation. There are numerous adhesives like gur, sugar, gum arabic  and methyl cellulose suitable for attaching inoculant to the seeds. <br />
                  The method of seed  inoculation includes preparation of 10% sugar or pharmaceutical grade gum  arabic or 1% methyl cellulose solution.   This solution is sprinkled on the seeds and the seeds are thoroughly  mixed so as to have a uniform coating.  A  count of 1000 viable cells per seed is to be attained at the time of treating  the seed and quantity of culture used is accordingly adjusted. The seeds are  spread uniformly for drying on a gunny bag or cement floor in shade avoiding  direct sunlight.<br />
  <strong>Response of legumes to <em>Rhizobium</em> inoculation</strong><br />
                  <em>Rhizobium</em> inoculation improves the  productivity of leguminous crop plants.   The efficacy of <em>Rhizobium</em> inoculation has been established in our country beyond any doubt by the results  of coordinated trials conducted by the Indian Council of Agricultural  Research.  The yield response varies with  the inoculant strain, location and crop variety. Average increase in yield of  some of the pulse crops due to Rhizobium inoculation is presented in table 8.5.            <br />

                <p><strong>Azotobacter: </strong><em>Azotobacter</em> is a free living, heterotrophic nitrogen fixing bacteria that occurs in  the rhizosphere of variety of plants. The genus <em>Azotobacter</em> has six species viz., <em>A. chroococcum, A. vinelandii, A. beijerinckii, A. nigricans, A.  armeniacus</em> and <em>A. paspali</em>. Except  the last species, which is a rhizoplane bacterium, the other members are  largely soil borne and rhizospheric. The potential of <em>A. chroococcum </em>and <em>A. paspali </em>as a biofertilizer for various non-legume crops is well documented.</p>
                <p align="justify"><img src="89498" /></p>
                <p><em>Azotobacter </em>is an aerobic, Gram  negative, rod shaped bacteria occurs singly, in chains, or in clumps. It does  not form endospores but do form thick-walled cysts. These cysts are resistant  to desiccation and to some deleterious chemical and physic agents. They,  however, cannot withstand extreme temperatures. While in the cyst stage of  their life cycle, they do not fix nitrogen and are optically refractile. It may  be motile by peritrichous flagella or non-mobile. It can produce a water  soluble pigment, either yellow-green, fluorescent or red-violet/  brownish-black. It grows well at an optimum temperature range between 20 and  30°C and at pH 7.0 - 7.5. They are able to grow on various carbohydrates,  alcohols, and organic acids.<br />
                  <em>Azotobacter</em> was first discovered using a culture that was devoid of a combined nitrogen  source. <em>Azotobacter</em> is found on  neutral to alkaline soils, in aquatic environments, in the plant rhizosphere  and phyllosphere. <em>A.chroococcum</em> is  the most common species of Azotobacter present in the soil. <br />
                  <em>Azotobacter </em>sp. are known to influence  plant growth through their ability to fix molecular nitrogen; production of  growth promoting substances like IAA, gibberellin or gibberellin-like compounds  and vitamins, excretion of ammonia in the rhizosphere in the presence of root  exudates; production of anti-fungal metabolites and phosphate solubilization.<br />
                  The  procedure followed for mass multiplication of <em>Azotobacter</em>, preparation of carrier based inoculant and seed  inoculation with carrier based <em>Azotobacter</em> is similar to that of rhizobial inoculation. Jensen's N-free medium is routinely  used for the mass multiplication of <em>Azotobacter</em>.  Seed inoculation of <em>A. chroococcum </em>increases the yield of field crops by about 10 % and  of cereals by about 15-20%. The response to inoculation was increased by  manuring or by fertilizer application. Coinoculation of <em>Azotobacter </em>with other bioinoculants like <em>Rhizobium</em>; <em>Azospirillum</em>,  P-solubilizers; vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza have been reported to enhance  the growth and yield of legumes, cereals and vegetable crops.<br />
                  Beneficial  effects of <em>Azotobacter chroococcum </em>inoculation  has been reported by various workers on various cereal, vegetables, oil seed,  legume and cash crops (Table ).    Inoculation experiments with <em>Azotobacter </em>gave better yield performance only at lower levels of nitrogen (0 to 30 kg  N ha-1). These diazotrophic bacteria require large amounts of  available carbon for their survival in soil. Addition of farmyard manure (FYM),  compost and other organic amendments to agricultural soils improves the  efficiency of <em>Azotobacter</em> and hence  the plant grown and yield. </p>

                    <strong><em>Azospirillum </em></strong><br />
                  Beijerinck in 1925  reported a nitrogen-fixing bacterium under the name <em>Spirillum lipoferum</em>.  The  ability to fix nitrogen by certain spirilla was first recorded by him, who  noticed their presence in enrichment cultures of <em>Azotobacter chroococcum.</em> A new orientation to the study of this  bacterium has come with the observations of Dobereiner and Day (1976) that <em>Azospirillum</em> could be isolated from the  roots of tropical grass <em>Digitaria  decumbens</em> using a semi-solid N2-free sodium malate enrichment  medium.  Surface sterilization of roots  by 70% alcohol and creation of micro-aerophilic (low oxygen requirements)  conditions in the medium are the two essential steps for the isolation of the  organism.  <em>Azospirillum</em> is recognized as a very ubiquitous soil organism  capable of colonizing effectively not only the roots of a wide variety of  plants but also their above ground portions forming apparently an associative  symbiosis.<br />
                  The  bacterium is Gram-negatiave, motile, generally vibroid in shape and contains  poly-b-hydroxy-butyrate  granules. It is very motile and possess a long, polar flagellum for swimming  and occasionally, peritrichous flagella for swarming on surfaces. The cells  change shape and size with culture age, and produce cysts. They can grow under  anaerobic (NO3- as acceptor of electrons,  denitrification), microaerophilic (N2 or NH3 as nitrogen  sources) and fully aerobic conditions with combined nitrogen only (NH3,  NO3-, amino acids). <em>Azospirillum</em> species grow well on organic acids such as malate, succinate, lactate and  pyruvate. On Rojo-Congo red medium, <em>Azospirillum</em> forms distinct scarlet red, dry and wrinkled colonies .</p>

                <p><strong>Taxonomy</strong><br />
            <em>Azospirillum </em>belongs to group 1 of the  alpha subclass of the Proteobacteria . At present there are five known species  of <em>Azospirillum- A. brasilense</em>,<em> A. lipoferum</em>,<em> A. amazonense, A. halopraeferens </em>and<em> A. irakense. </em>The distinguishing morphological and biochemical  characteristics of the five species is given in table .<br />

<strong>Inoculant production</strong><br />
For mass  multiplication of <em>Azospirillum</em>, the  organism is allowed to grow in flasks containing NH4Cl and malate  medium and incubated at 35o - 37o C for 3 days.  When there is good growth, the broth culture  is mixed with the carrier, and the carrier-based culture is packed in  polyethylene pouches. The technique used for preparation of carrier based  inoculant and for inoculating the seed or seedlings with <em>Azospirlllum</em> culture is same as that described earlier in case of <em>Rhizobium.</em> <br />
<strong>Crop response to <em>Azospirillum</em> inoculation</strong><br />
            <em>Azospirillum</em> is extensively used as an  inoculant for crop plants belonging to the family gramineae like wheat,  sorghum, pearlmillet, fingermillet, barley and maize. Of all the crops tested,  sorghum (<em>Sorghum bicolor</em>),  pearlmillet (<em>Pennisetum americanum</em>)  and fingermillet (<em>Eleusine coracana</em>)  appeared to be consistently responsive to <em>Azosprillum</em> at more than one location in India. <em>Azospirillum</em> species promote the yield of agriculturally important crops in many different  soils and climatic regions. By the use of this organism as a seed inoculant,  savings of 20-30 kg N/ha equivalents can be achieved in these crops. However,  the principal effects of azospirilla go far beyond furnishing nitrogen to host  plants.<br />
Once inoculated onto  plant roots, <em>Azospirillum</em> cells  induce remarkable changes in the morphology and behaviour of the entire root  system. For instance, hairs close to the root tip take on a more distinctive  appearance, and the overall density and the length of the root system increases  (Fig ). Root hairs consist of expanded root epidermal cells, which play a role  in water and nutrient exchanges and also help to anchor root to its  surroundings. Inoculating azospirilla onto plant roots also increases the  diameter and length of both lateral and adventitious roots and typically leads  to additional branching of the lateral roots. These developments in the root  system are important because they increase absorptive area and volume of the  soil substrate available to the plant. </p>
                <p align="justify"><img src="519" /></p>
                <p>Strains of <em>Azospirillum</em> are known to produce  siderophores. They are low molecular weight iron binding compounds synthesized  in large amounts and excreted into culture medium by microorganisms under  iron-deficient conditions.  Siderophores form  complexes with the metal ions in the culture medium followed by translocation  of the complex through bacterial envelope. The ability of <em>Azospirillum</em> to synthesize siderophores may contribute to improve  the iron nutrition of plants and offer protection from minor pathogens. <br />
                  Biosynthesis of growth  promoting substances like phytohormones, vitamins, antibacterial and anti  fungal substances by <em>Azospirillum</em> is  well documented.  The most extensively  reported growth promoters are IAA, gibberellins, cytokinin like-substances and  vitamins. <br />
                  The ability of  azospirilla to form antibiotic substances varies from strain to strain.  Fungistatic activity of azospirilla against a  wide range of phyto-pathogenic fungi has been reported e.g. certain azospirilla  offer protection to cotton plants against <em>Thielaviopsis  basicola</em> and <em>Fusarium oxysporum</em>.<br />
                  These enhancing  features of <em>Azospirillum</em> inoculation  are also evident in field experiments, with the bacteria not only increasing  root numbers but also improving yields of crops such as wheat, sorghum,  pearlmillet and maize. In field experiments in Israel, <em>Azospirillum</em> inoculated sorghum plants made better use of moisture  stored in soils from winter precipitation than did uninoculated plants. In both  green house and field experiments, inoculated plants are efficient at absorbing  nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other microelements from soil than  uninoculated plants.  <br />
                  In  recent years, interest has shifted from plant-microbe interaction to  plant-microbe-microbe interactions. Several reports have brought to light  instances where beneficial effects of <em>Azospirillum </em>on plants are enhanced when coinoculated with other microorganisms like <em>Rhizobium</em> and <em>Azotobacter</em>. Synergistic effects of<em> Azospirillum </em>with <em>Rhizobium </em>on  various legumes have been reported. Stimulation of nodulation may be due to an  increase in production of lateral roots and in root hair branching. This, in  turn, has been thought to be due to production of phytohormones by <em>Azospirillum</em>. The positive effect of  inoculating non-legumes with <em>Azospirillum  brasilense </em>and <em>Azotobacter  chroococcum</em>, at low application rates of mineral N, on associative N2  fixation and on crop yield has been reported.<br />
  <strong><em>Acetobacter  diazotrophicus</em></strong><strong> </strong><br />
  <em>Acetobacter diazotrophicus</em>, is  a gram-negative, microaerobic, nitrogen fixing microorganism and was isolated  from washed roots and stems of sugarcane, using semi-solid N-free sugar medium  acidified with acetic acid to pH 4.5. Cells of <em>Acetobacter diazotrophicus </em>are straight rods with rounded ends,  about 0.7 to 0.9 by 2 um, motile by lateral or peritrichous flagella. Optimum  growth temperature is around 30C. Although sucrose is the best  C-source for <em>Acetobacter diazotrophicus </em>but  sugars like glucose, fructose, galactose, mannitol are also utilized. It grows  well in the pH range of 3.8 to 5.8 with good nitrogenase activity. Growth and  nitrogen fixation occur at sugar concentration ranging from 10 to 30 %.<br />
                  <em>Acetobacter  diazotrophicus</em>, an endophytic diazotroph, has been found mainly associated  with sugar-rich plants such as sugarcane, sweet potato, Cameroon grass, sweet  sorghum and coffee. It colonizes roots, stems and leaves of host plants.  Reports from Brazil indicates that <em>A.  diazotrophicus</em> contributes &gt;50% of biologically fixed nitrogen in  sugarcane. Nitrogen fixed by <em>A.  diazotrophicus</em> is excreted as ammonia into the medium. Strains of <em>Acetobacter</em> have been shown to produce  considerable amount of IAA. Synergistic effects on plant growth and yield  following inoculation with <em>Acetobacter  diazotrophicus</em> and AM fungi have been reported for sugarcane, sweet potato  and sweet sorghum.<br />
  <strong>Blue green algae and <em>Azolla</em></strong><br />
                  Blue-green algae  (cyanobacteria) are ubiquitous in distribution.   They are either single celled or consist of branched or unbranched  filaments (Fig.  a,b,c). It is a group of  free living organisms that has been demonstrated to be an ideal candidate as  the biological nitrogen source in rice ecosystems. Some of them possess a  peculiar structure known as 'heterocyst' and all heterocystous forms can fix  nitrogen from air.  Recently, some  blue-green algae without heterocysts have also been found to fix nitrogen under  special conditions like low oxygen tension. The algae that are generally used  for field application are species of <em>Aulosira</em>,<em> Tolypothrix</em>,<em> Scytonema</em>,<em> Nostoc</em>,<em> Anabaena </em>and <em>Plectonema</em> as a mixture.</p>
                <p><img src="52665" /></p>
                <p>Cyanobacteria have  ability to carry out both photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation. Besides  contributing to the nitrogen economy of the soils these algae have other  beneficial effects. Their exceptionally good water holding capacity, their  ability to concentrate nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, fixed carbon and  trace elements, their soil binding capacity and their ability to scavenge  sodium from salt affected soils are additional ecological advantages. The  presence of BGA in the immediate vicinity of rice seeds can decrease sulphide  and iron injury to the plants. Cyanobacteria also produce number of plant  growth substances like amino acids, small proteins and peptides, sugars,  complex polysaccharides, vitamins and growth hormones. Standing crops of  nitrogen fixing BGA range from 5-20 tons per hectare fresh weight and  contribute approximately 30kg nitrogen per season per hectare of rice field. A  bulk of the organic matter produced by algal growth remains in the soil and  becomes available to the next crop as organic enrichment<br />
                  <strong>Production of algae for field application</strong><br />
            Based  on the natural ecology of these algae, a simple rural-oriented open-air method  of producing them in bulk has been developed. The basic principle is to grow  them in natural sunlight under conditions stimulating these in the rice field.  You can use a starter culture, consisting of soil-based mixture of efficient  strains of BGA, supplied by various agricultural universities for mass  multiplication. <br />
            Shallow  stays (15cm x 7.5 cm x 22.5 cm) of galvanized iron sheet, or brick and mortar,  or pits lined with polythene sheets are prepared.  The size can be increased if more material is  to be produced.  About 10kg soil is  placed and mixed with 200 g super phosphate.   The trays are then filled with water (5-15 cm) depending upon the local  conditions and rate of evaporation; the pH of the soil should be around  neutral.  After soil settles down,  saw-dust and the starter culture are  sprinkled on the surface of the standing water.   The whole assembly is exposed to sunlight.  In hot summer months, the growth of the algae  will be rapid and in about a week a thick algal mat will be formed on the surface  of the soil and sometimes even floats up.   If the daily rate of evaporation is high, more water is added  intermittently.  When the algal growth  becomes sufficiently thick, addition of water should be discontinued and the  water is allowed to dry up in the sun.   The dried algal flakes are collected from the surface and stored in bags  for future use in the fields.  The trays  are again filled with water and a small amount of the dry algal flakes is  added, as further inoculum.  The process  is continued as above.  Once the soil in  the tray is exhausted (usually 3-4 harvests), fresh soil is put and mixed with  super phosphate and the process is repeated as before.  To prevent the breeding of insects,  application of Malathion (0.00075 ppm) or Carbofuran (3% granules) is  recommended.<br />
             Algae are applied at the rate of 10kg/ha over  the standing water in the field one week after transplantation.  The field is kept waterlogged at least for a  couple of days immediately after algal application.<br />
<strong><em>Azolla-Anabaena</em></strong><strong> symbiosis</strong><br />
            <em>Azolla</em> is a small aquatic fern and is  omnipresent in nature. Each leaf consists of two lobes, a thick aerial dorsal  lobe and a thin ventral lobe occasionally of a slightly larger size. The dorsal  lobe is green and has a blue green algal symbiont (<em>Anabaena  azollae</em>) within a  central cavity. The heterocyst of the symbiont <em>Anabaena</em> is the site of nitrogen fixation. <em>Azolla </em>provides nutrients and a protective leaf cavity for <em>Anabaena</em>, which in turn provided  nitrogen for the fern.<br />
<em>Azolla </em>is found on still water in  ponds, lakes, swamps, ditches and paddy fields of temperate and tropical  regions.  Because of its rapid growth,  high N content and ability to grow in still water, it has been exploited as a  fertilizer for rice.  This is used in  Vietnam and China for centuries, however, its use as a biofertilizer in India  is relatively a recent development. There are 7 living species of <em>Azolla</em> - <em>A. pinnata</em>,<em> A. caroliniana</em>,<em> A. rubra</em>,<em> A filiculoides</em>,<em> A. nilotica</em>,<em> A. mexicana and A. microphylla</em>.  <em>A.  pinnata</em> is native to India but now many of these species have been  introduced. <br />
The high N2  fixing ability, rapid growth, high biomass accumulation and N-content  determines the potential of <em>Azolla</em> as  a biofertilizer for rice. Biological nitrogen fixation through <em>Azolla - Anabaena</em> complex is considered  a potential biological system for increasing rice yield at comparatively low  cost.  The ability of <em>Azolla</em> to fix N2 is about 1.1  kg N/ha/day.  The doubling time varies  between 2 and 10 days for most species and maximum biomass ranged between 0.8  to 5.2 t dry matter/ha with an average of 2.1 t/ha.<br />
<strong>Large scale production of <em>Azolla</em></strong><br />
            The  potential <em>Azolla </em>species are  maintained in concrete tanks keeping soil under flooded conditions.  Partial shade helps during summer  months.  From these <em>Azolla</em> is harvested and used as inoculum in bigger size plots or in  small ponds generally found in villages of rice growing areas.<br />
            Its  large-scale production is carried out in a nicely prepared field divided into  small sub-plots with good irrigation facility (4-50 sq.m. plot with 5-10 cm  water depth).  <em>Azolla </em>is inoculated at the rate of 0.5 to 1.0 t/ha.  Inoculation with higher doses ensures rapid  multiplication.  Super phosphate at the  rate of 4-8 kg/ha stimulates fern growth. Insecticide like Furadan is also  applied (2.5-3.0 kg/ha).  Under optimum  conditions, <em>Azolla </em>forms a thick mat  on water surface in 15-20 days. About two-third of it is harvested and the  remaining is left for further multiplication.   It again multiplies and forms a thick mat in 2-3 weeks.  About 100kg fresh <em>Azolla</em> inoculum can be obtained every week from a nursery of 100m2.  Super phosphate at the rate of 60 kg/ha can  be split into 2-3 doses or added at week interval to have better results.  If <em>Azolla</em> multiplication is good even without addition of P, then there is no need to add  it.<br />
<strong>Phosphate solubilizing and mobilizing microbes</strong><br />
Phosphorus is a major  nutrient required for the growth of plant. There are large reserves of  phosphorus in soils but very little amount is available to the plant. There are  microorganisms in soil that can solubilize the unavailable phosphorus and make  it available to plant. They are called Phosphate solubilizing microorgamisms  (PSM). A group of fungi associates with the roots of higher plants and mobilize  the phosphorus from soil to the plant system.<br />
<strong>Phosphate solubilizing microorganisms   </strong><br />
            The  majority of agricultural soils contain large reserves of phosphorus of which a  considerable part has accumulated as consequence of regular applications of  P-fertilizer. The phenomenon of fixation and precipitation of P in soil, which  is highly dependent on pH, causes a low efficiency of soluble P fertilizers. In  acidic soils P is precipitated as Al and Fe phosphates whereas in calcareous  soils high concentration of Ca results in P precipitation. The soil is a  habitat for diverse group of organisms that employ variety of solubilization  reactions to release soluble phosphorus from insoluble phosphates. The  potential of these phosphate solubilizing microorganisms has been realised and  are utilised as bioinoculants for crop grown in soils poor in available P and  amended with rock phosphate or tricalcium phosphate.<br />
            Phosphorus  solubilizing microorganisms include various bacterial, fungal and actinomycetes  forms which help to convert insoluble inorganic phosphate into simple and  soluble forms.  Members of <em>Pseudomonas, Micrococcus, Bacillus,  Flavobacterium, Penicillum, Fusarium, Sclerotium</em> and <em>Aspergillus</em> are some of the phosphate-solubilizing  micro-organisms.  They normally grow in a  medium containing insoluble tri-calcium phosphate [Ca3(PO4)2],  apatite, rock phosphate, FePO4 and AIPO4 as sole source  of phosphate. The initial isolation of phosphate solubilizers is made by using  Pikovaskaya medium suspended with insoluble-phosphates such as tri-calcium  phosphate.  The production of clearing  zones around the colonies of the organism is an indication of the presence of  phosphate-solubilizing organisms (Fig. ).   Such cultures are isolated, identified and the extent of solubilization  determined quantitatively.  Several rock  phosphate dissolving bacteria, fungi, yeast and actinomycetes were isolated  from soil samples collected from rock phosphate deposits and rhizosphere soils  of different leguminous crops. The most efficient bacterial isolates were  identified as <em>Pseudomonas striata,  Pseudomonas rathonis</em> and <em>Bacillus  polymyxa</em> and fungal isolates as <em>Aspergillus  awamori, Penicillium digitatum, Aspergillus niger</em> and a yeast-<em>Schwanniomyces occidentalis</em>.  These efficient micro-organisms have shown  consistently their capability to solubilize chemically-fixed soil phosphorus  and rock phosphate from different sources - Mussorie, Udaipur, Matoon,  Singhbhum, Morocco, Gafsa and Jordan.  In  addition, these micro-organisms were found to mineralize organic phosphorus to  soluble form due to enzymatic activity.</p>
                <p><img src="2168" /></p>
                <p>The efficient cultures have shown  capacity to solubilize insoluble inorganic phosphate such as rock phosphate,  tri-calcium phosphate, iron and aluminium phosphates by production of organic  acids.  They can also mineralize organic  phosphatic compounds present in organic manure and soils. Inoculation of PSM to  seeds or seedlings increases the grain yield of crops. They are known to add  30-35 kg P2O5 ha-1. <br />
            The  inorganic phosphate solubilization by microbes can be attributed to  acidification, chelation, exchange reaction in growth medium as well as to the  proton transfer during ammonium assimilation.<br />
<strong>Phosphate mobilizing microbes: Mycorrhizae </strong><br />
<strong>            </strong>The  term mycorrhizae was coined for symbiotic associations formed by fungi with  roots (Gr. myces = fungus, rhizo = roots). Mycorrhizae are wide spread under  natural conditions and occur nearly in all soils from mine spoils to  agricultural soils as well as soil under horticultural or fruit crops. More  than 95% of plant taxa form mycorrhizal associations. The association is  generally mutualistic in that the fungi obtain a carbon source from host,  whilst the latter benefits from enhanced nutrient uptake through transfer from  soil via the fungi. They are formed by most vascular plants except for a few  monocotyledons like cyperacea or juncacae and dicotyledons like chenopodiacea  or brassicaceae. Mycorrhizea are usually divided into three morphologically  distinct groups depending on whether or not there is fungal penetration of root  cells : endomycorrhiza,  ectomycorrhiza  and ectoendomycorrhiza. Of the three groups, endomycorrhizae are important as  biofertilizer.<br />
</p>
                <p><img src="125644" /></p>
                <p> Endomycorrhizae are formed by nearly 90% of  the land plants. In this association the fungi form external hyphal networks in  the soil and grow extensively within the cells of the root cortex. This network  of fungal hyphae within the root cortex is known as hartig net. Fungi belonging  to basidiomycetes, ascomycetes or zygomycetes are involved depending on the  type of endomycorrhizal association. Specific types of endomycorrhizae are  formed by members of the Ericaceae (<em>Ericoid  mycorrhizae)</em> and orchidaceae (orchidaceous mycorrhizae), but the type of  mycorrhizae which is widespread is the arbuscular mycorrhizae (earlier referred  as vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae). It is formed by 120 species of  zygomycetes, all belonging to the order <em>Glomales  (Glomus, Acaulospora, Gigaspora, Sclerocystis, Entrophospora and Scutellospora)</em>.  None of these fungi has yet been successfully cultured axenically.</p>
                <p><img src="164498" /><br clear="all" />
                </p>
                <p>                The  effect of mycorrhizae in increasing plant growth has been well documented by  different workers for many plants. The beneficial effect of mycorrhizae on  plant growth has mostly been attributed to an increase in the uptake of  nutrients, especially phosphorus. Mycorrhizal fungi improve the soil phosphorus  availability by solubilizing inorganic forms of phosphorus or by mineralization  of organic phosphorus. External hyphae of mycorrhiza also has the capacity to  take up and deliver various other nutrients to plants like NH4+,  NO3- ,K, Ca, SO42- , Cu, Zn and Fe.  In experimental chambers, the external hyphae of AM can deliver upto 80% of  plant P, 25 % of plant N, 10% of plant K, 25% of plant Zn and 60% of plant  Cu.  Mycorrhiza also produce ectoenzymes  which provide host plant with the potential to access organic N and P forms  that are normally unavailable to AM fungi or to non mycorrhizal roots.</p>
                <p><strong>Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR)</strong> <br />
                  The  environment, or the volume of soil that is influenced biologically and  biochemically by living root, is known as rhizosphere. Root exudates and  secretions create a rhizosphere effect that manifests itself in the intense  microbial activity that is associated within the immediate vicinity of the  root. Root associated bacteria, also called rhizobacteria , can be beneficial,  neutral or deleterious to the growth of the plant. Plant growth promoting  rhizobacteria (PGPR) are one class of beneficial bacteria inhabiting the soil  ecosystem (Kloepper<em> et al</em> 1989). The  effects of PGPR on plant growth can be mediated by direct or indirect  mechanisms (Glick 1995). The direct effects have been most commonly attributed  to the production of plant hormones such as auxins, gibberellins and  cytokinins, or  by supplying biologically  fixed nitrogen or solubilizing insoluble P. These PGPR also affect growth by  indirect mechanisms such as supperssion of bacterial, fungal and nematode  pathogens by the production of siderophores, HCN, ammonia, antibiotics,  volatile metabolites etc., by induced systemic resistance and/or by competing  with the pathogen for nutrients or for colonization space.<br />
                  The  nitrogen fixing and phosphate solubilising bacteria have been discussed  separately. Other PGPR include bacteria belonging to the genera <em>Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Burkholderia,</em> <em>Enterobacter Klebsiella, Pseudomonas,  Xanthomonas, Serratia </em>and many more yet to be identified. Effects of PGPR  on plant growth have been evaluated by many workers on different crops.  Increase in plant height and root and shoot biomass of wheat was reported  following inoculation with 12 different isolates of PGPR belonging to <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. cepacia,</em> <em>P. fluorescens</em> and <em>P. putida</em>. Similarly treatment of wheat seeds with fluorescent  pseudomonads (antagonistic to<em> Gaeumannomyces graminis)</em> resulted in yield increases of 27% in field  trials. PGPR are potent inoculants but are not commercialised due to lack of  consistency under field conditions. Recent work suggests that combination of  PGPR strains (two or more) which have diverge mode of plant growth promotion or  antagonism against soil-borne pathogens are more effective than single strain  inoculum. IAA producing <em>Bacillus</em> isolates promoted root growth and (or) nodulation when coinoculated with <em>Rhizobium etli</em> on<em> Phaseolus vulgaris</em>. Similarly coinoculation of soybean with <em>B. japonicum </em>and <em>Serratia liquefaciens </em>2-68 or <em>S.  proteamaculans</em> 1-102 increased soybean grain and protein yield compared to  the non treated controls. Better biocontrol of take all disease of wheat was  observed when fluorescent<em> Pseudomonas</em> was applied in combination with <em>Trichoderma  koningii</em>. Seed treatment containing combinations of <em>Escherichia coli</em> S17R1 and <em>Burkholderia  cepacia </em>BC-B provided significantly greater suppression of cucumber  seedling pathogenesis in a field soil naturally infested with <em>Pythium </em>and <em>Fusarium</em> spp<em>.</em> than seeds  treated with strain BC-B,  S17R1 or <em>Enterobacter cloacae</em> 501 R3. Experiments  performed at chernobyl showed that coinoculation of ‘duet’ of nitrogen fixing <em>Klebsiella oxytoca </em>VN13 and <em>Xanthomonas maltophila</em> VN12 could  protect maize from radionuclides penetration; as well improve the yield and  percentage of protein in seed.</p>
                <p><img src="216564" /></p>
                <p>Many bacterial genera  have shown their potential for biocontrol both under<em> in vivo</em> and <em>in vitro</em> conditions.<em> Agrobacterium</em>,<em> Arthrobacter</em>,<em> Alcaligenes</em>,<em> Bacillus,</em> <em>Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas,  Burkholderia,</em> <em>Rhizobium </em>and <em>Serratia </em>  were found to be potent for suppression of  soil-borne fungal pathogens. Many of these biocontrol agents exhibited their  effectiveness under field conditions also.</p>
