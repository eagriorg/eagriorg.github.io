				<p>The  term soil generally refers to the loose material of the earth surface and is  the region that supports the plant life. It consists of five major components  such as mineral matter, water, air, organic matter and living organisms.  The proportion of these components varies  with soil type and other soil conditions. To maintain the level of these  components it is essential that they undergo a regular process of recycling.  This process of recycling through various transformations  is brought about by different microorganism.</p>

                  The most important element in the  biological realm and substance that serve as the cornerstone of the cell  structure is carbon.  It constituents  about 40-50% of all living organisms, yet the ultimate source is the CO2  that exist in a perennially short supply, only 0.03% of the earth’s atmosphere,  which undergo a cyclic change from an oxidized to reduced state.</p>
                <p>                  Carbon (CO­2) is  constantly (reduced into organic carbon compounds) being fixed into organic  form by photosynthetic organisms (photosynthesis). Once bound, the carbon  becomes unavailable for use in generation of new plant life.  It is thus essential for the carbonaceous  materials to be decomposed and returned to the atmosphere. It is estimated that  1.3x1014 kg CO2 is fixed annually in the biosphere.  To the lesser extent CO2 is also  fixed through the agency of photosynthetic bacteria and other chemolithotrophs  with the convertion of so much of the plant available carbon to organic form  each year and the limited supply in the air, it is apparent that the major  plant nutrient element would become exhausted in the absence of microbial  transformation.<br />
                  The carbon cycle revolves about CO2  and its fixation and regeneration. The green plants utilize CO2 as  their sole carbon source, and the carbonaceous matter synthesized serves to  supply carbon to other heterotrophic organisms and animals.  Upon the death of plants and animals,  microbes assume a dominant role in carbon cycle.  The dead tissues are degraded and transformed  into microbial cells and humus or soil organic fraction.  Further decomposition of these materials  leads to the production of CO2 and once again it is recycled.</p>
                <p><strong>Organic  matter decomposition (Aerobic decay)</strong><br />
                  <strong>Soil organic  matter</strong><br />
                  The organic matter subjected to  microbial decay in soil comes from several sources like plant remains, forest  litter, incorporation of plant and animal tissues and excretory products.  The chemistry of organic matter is clearly  very complex, and investigations of the transformations and the responsible  organisms have therefore been extremely interesting.  The organic constituents of the plants are  commonly divided into six categories. </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>                    a)  Cellulose                             -  Most abundant 15-60% of the dry weight<br />
                    b)  Hemicellulose                     - 10-30%  of the plant dry weight<br />
                    c)  Lignin                                  -  5 – 30 % of the plant dry weight<br />
                    d)  Water soluble fraction         - 5-30%,  included simple sugar, a. acids, <br />
                    e)  Ether and alcohol soluble constituents, a fraction containing fat, oils, waxes,  resins and a number of pigments<br />
                    f)  Proteins. </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>                  As the plant ages,  the content of water soluble constituents, proteins and minerals decreases and  the % of abundance of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin rises.<br />
                  Soil organic matter comprises  residues of plant and animals and these compounds occur in soil in close  combination with inorganic substances.   Animals and plant residues are made up of complex carbohydrates, simple  sugars, starch, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins, gums, mucilage, proteins  fats, oils, waxes, resins, alcohols, aldehydes , ketones, organic acids,  lignin, phenols, tannins, hydrocarbons, alkaloids, pigments etc.</p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>The soil microorganism       play important role in the decomposition of soil organic matter.</li>
                  <li>Bacteria are the       dominant group – mostly heterotrophic organisms (use energy from organic       sources such as sugars, starch, cellulose and protein) – are       involved.  Autotrophic organism       which occupy a small portion of the biomass in soil (and use inorganic       sources such as Fe and S) are not directly involved in organic matter       decomposition.</li>
                  <li>Actinomycetes grow on       complex substances such as keratin, chitin and other complex       polysaccharides and play active role in humus formation.</li>
                  <li>Soil fungi are mostly       heterotrophos and use organic residues easily</li>
                  <li>Soil algae contribute       a small amount of organic matter through their biomass, but they do not       have any active role in organic matter decomposition.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Organic  matter decomposition serves two important functions</strong></p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>                  a)  Provide energy for growth<br />
                    b)  Supply carbon for the formation of new cell materials<br />
                    Hence only heterotrophs are actively  involved in the process of decomposition.   The relationship between organic matter and plant growth may be direct  or indirect.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Organic matter is a       natural substrate for saprophytic micro organism and provides nutrition to       plants indirectly through the activity of soil microorganisms</li>
                  <li>It is essential for       the formation of soil aggregates and hence soil structure which ultimately       determines the soil aeration and rooting habit of plants</li>
                  <li>Organic matter helps       in the conservation of soil nutrients by preventing erosion and surface       run off of nutrients. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Carbon  assimilation</strong><br />
                The process of converting substrate  to protoplasmic carbon is known as assimilation. Under aerobic conditions  20-40% of the substrate carbon is assimilated, the remainder is released as CO2.  Fungi are more efficient, in their  metabolism, since they convert carbon into cell carbon as filaments and release  less of CO2. 30-40% of which is used to form new mycelium during the  decomposition. Compared to fungi, bacteira are less efficient.  Aerobic bacteria are less efficient than  anerobic bacteria.</p>
                <p><strong>C.  Mineralization </strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Conversion of organic Carbon  substance to inorganic form of carbon.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Immobilization</strong><br />
                  Assimilation of nutrients and is the  mechanism by which micro organism reduce the quantity of plant available  nutrient in soil. Mineralization is considered well than immobilization.<br />
                  During the decomposition of organic  matter three separate simultaneous processes can be distinguished.  The important changes during decomposition  are:</p>
                <ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Plant and animal       tissues constituents disappear under the influence of enzymes</li>
                  <li>Synthesis of new       microbial cells so that proteins, polysaccharides and nucleic acids       typical of bacteria and fungi appear.</li>
                  <li>Third, certain end       products of the breakdown are excreted into surroundings there to       accumulate or to be further metabolized.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Importance of  organic matter decomposition </strong></p>
                <ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Important function is       the breakdown of organic matter by which CO2 available for       photosynthesis is replenished</li>
                  <li>Any compound that is       synthesized biologically is subject to destruction by soil inhabitants,       otherwise the compounds would have accumulated in vast amounts on the       earth’s surface</li>
                  <li>Since, organic matter       degradation is a property of all heterotrophs, it is commonly used to       indicate the level of microbial activity.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Methods to  evaluate the decomposition rate</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Measurement  of CO2 evolution or O2 uptake</li>
                  <li>Determination  of decrease in organic matter either chemically or by weight loss</li>
                  <li>Observations  on disappearance of specific constituents such as cellulose, hemicellulose or  lignin.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Changes  during organic matter decomposition</strong><br />
                  As a result of development of mixed  flora on chemically complex natural products, some components quickly disappear  while others are less susceptible to microbial enzymes and persist.  The water soluble fraction contains the least  resistant plant components and is thus the first to be metabolized. Cellulose  and hemicellulose on the other hand disappear not as quickly as water soluble  substances, but their persistence usually is not too great.  The lignins are highly resistant and  consequently become relatively more abundant in the residual, decaying organic  matter.</p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>At aerobic conditions       when carbonaceous substrates are incorporated into soil, immediate drop in       O2 and an increase in CO2 content of soil air       occurs.</li>
                  <li>Change in (O) (H)       oxidation reduction potential (En) – it is shifted to a more reduced       condition (fall in oxidation reduction potential).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The end products of  decomposition are - </strong>CO2,  H2O, NO3, SO4, CH4, NH4  and H2S depending on the availability of air.<br />

                  <li>Nitrogen is a key nutrient substance for microbial growth</li>
                  <li>If N content of the substrate is high it is readily utilized and       decomposition is faster</li>

                  <li>Optimum level of C: ratio for maximum decomposition is       20-25(1.4-1.7% N)</li>
                  <li>Less than this range, more microbial cells, faster mineralization       and it likely exceeds immobilization</li>

                <p> <strong> Anaerobic decay /  decomposition</strong><br />
                  The main products of aerobic carbon  mineralization are CO2, water, cells and humus components. In the  absence of O2 organic carbon is incompletely metabolized,  intermediary substances accumulate, and abundant quantities of CH4  and smaller amounts of H2 are evolved. Energy yield during anaerobic  fermentation is low, resulting in fewer microbial cells per unit of organic  carbon degraded. Consequently, organic matter breakdown is consistently slower  under total anaerobiosis than in environments containing adequate O2.  The rate in water logged soils is  intermediate between the two extremes. <br />
                  When a soil is water logged or  flooded there is a shift from aerobic to anaerobic transformation. Formation  and accumulation of organic acids <em>viz., </em>acetic,  formic, butyric, lactic and succinic acids appear too, these are frequently  detrimental to root development. Organic acids accumulate because of the  fermentative character of the microflora of wet soils. The an aerobic carbon  transformation are thus characterized by the formation of organic acids,  alcohols, CH4 and CO2 as major end products.<br />
                  Under anaerobic conds, decomposition  of organic residues takes place by the activity of both mesophilic,  thermophilic microorganism resulting in the production of CO2, H,  ethyl alcohol, and organic acids.  Among  mesoophilis, bacteria are more active than fungi or actinomycetes in  cellulolytic activity. They belong to genus <em>Clostridium</em> which are numerous in manure pits but rarely encountered in cultivated arable  soils.  In compost pits both meso and  thermopholic (bacterial and actinomycetes) are important in the breakdown of  cellulose substances. <br />
                  The primary microbial colonisers  initially break down the complex CH2O and proteins into organic  acids and alcohols.  At a later stage,  the methane bacteria which are strict anaerobes begin to act upon the secondary  substrate chiefly lactic and butyric acids and ferment them into CH4  and CO2.<br />

                <p><strong>Interms of  specific elements </strong><br />
                  The organic fraction contains  compounds of C, H, O, N, P, S and small amounts of other elements.  Only a small portion of the total is soluble  in water, but much can be brought into solution by alkali.<br />
  <strong>Interms of  type of compounds</strong><br />
                  Humus contains a number of  polymerized substances, aromatic, molecules, polysaccharides, ascorbic acids,  polymers of uronic acids and P containing compounds.<br />
                  No definite composition can be  assigned. It should be considered as a portion of the soil that is composed of  a heterogenous group of substances, most having an unknown parentage and an  unknown chemical structure.<br />
                  Lignin and lignin derived molecules  have long been considered to be of significance in the formation of humus.<br />
                  It is possible either that simple  aromatics released in the microbial attack on lignin polymerize to yield  constituents of the soil organic fraction or those partially altered lignins  itself give rise to humus constituents. The monomeric portions of humus are  similar to the constituents of lignin.<br />
  <strong>Degradation  processes</strong><br />
  <strong>(1) Cellulose </strong>is a CH2O  composed of glucose units bound by β-linkage at carbon 1 and 4 of the sugar  molecule.  The cellulose concentration of  higher plants is never fixed and the concentration. It is a polymer of glucose  and is might abundant organic material in nature changes with age and type of  plants.  Woody materials have more  cellulose and succulent tissues had poor, but the concentration increases as  the plant matures.  Cellulose breakdown  in soil is influenced by several environmental factors.<br />
                  Aerobic organism converts cellulose  to 2 major products: CO2 + cell substance, but certain group  releases small amount of organic acids. It is however resistant to microbial  decomposition.  When cellulose is  associated with pentosans (xylan, mannans) it undergoes rapid decomposition.  When associated with lignin, the  decomposition rate is very low. Degradation is by the enzymes that converts  cellulose into glucose. (Exoenzymes)<br />
                  Exoglucanase<br />
                  Endoglucanase<br />
                  β - glucosidase (cellulse complex)<br />

                  Most cellulolytic bacteria  do not excrete significant amounts of cellulase but fungi are found to excrete  these enzymes.  The soluble sugars  released by enzymatic hydrolysis are later utilized by the same or other micro  organism for biosynthetic purpose.<br />
  <strong>(2)  Hemicellulose</strong><br />
                  It is a polymer of simple sugars  such as pentose, hexose and uronic acids.   They may be either homo or hetero polymers. When they are added to soil,  degradation takes place at faster rate in initial stages. The hemicelluloses  such as mannans are decomposed rapidly while galactons (polymer of galactose)  are decomposed slowly.  Many soil micro  organisms utilize hemicellulose in both aerobic as well as anaerobic  conditions. The microbial degradation occurs through the agency of  extracellular enzymes called hemicellulases. <br />
  <strong>(3) Lignin</strong><br />
                  Lignin is the third most abundant  costituent of plants.  It consists of  heterocyclic aromatic organic molecules containing C, H and O.  The degradation is very slow and rate of  decomposition depends on the presence of other compounds such as cellulose and  hemicellulose acid.  Lignin is highly  resistant to microbial degradation.  Degradation  is a complex process. <br />
