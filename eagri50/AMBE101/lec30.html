				<p><strong>Introduction</strong> <br />
In  the twentieth century, the ever increase in the global human<br />
 population and industrialization led to the  exploitation of natural resources. The increased usage of heavy metals<br />
 and its disposal in the ecosystems around the  world and also in India is becoming an important ecological issue to be take  into our consideration. This has indiscriminate release of heavy metals into  the ecosystem has already posing air, water and soil pollution causing various<br />
 uncompromising, deleterious and fatal effects  on humans and the<br />
 stability of the ecosystems. <br />
            Soil and water are the most  important natural resources for all living beings including human beings for  survival, which are recently becoming highly polluted. As a result of this,  several living forms which are better suited to the polluted environment have  out bursted causing ecological imbalance. Unlike soil, water body has its own  ability to maintain its natural state through process called self purification.  However when the discharge of pollutants is heavy, the process of self  purification of water bodies is adversely affected and the water remains  polluted. <br />
            Unlike organic contaminants,<br />
 heavy metals are not biologically degradable,  and<br />
 therefore can persist in the environment for a  long<br />
 duration. The term ‘heavy metal’ can be  explained as 1) Relatively<br />
 abundant in the earth’s crust; 2) Reasonable  extraction<br />
 and usage; 3) Having direct contact with  people; and 4)<br />
 Toxic to humans. Heavy metals<br />
<img width="363" height="240" src="lec30_clip_image002.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="Description: bioremediation-768259.jpg" /> are the metals which have a specific gravity  of more than 4 or more than 5 (Anonymous, 1964; Nieboer and Richardson, 1980).  Some important heavy metals are Zinc (Zn), Chromium (Cr), Cadmium (Cd), Arsenic  (As) etc.,<br />
Bioremediation can be defined as any  process that uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism">microorganisms</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi">fungi</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoremediation">green  plants</a> or their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme">enzymes</a> to return the natural environment  altered by contaminants to its original condition. Bioremediation may be  employed to attack specific <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_contaminant">soil  contaminants</a>,  such as degradation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine">chlorinated</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon">hydrocarbons</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterium">bacteria</a>. An example of a more general  approach is the cleanup of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_spill">oil spills</a> by the addition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate">nitrate</a> and/or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate">sulfate</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertiliser">fertilisers</a> to facilitate the  decomposition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crude_oil">crude oil</a> by indigenous or exogenous  bacteria.<br />
Mycoremediation is a form of bioremediation that uses  fungi to reduce the level of contamination  in a given environment. Fungi can release specific enzymes and acids  that break down the major components of plant fiber. The accumulation of waste  is directly proportional to population and as our population grows scientists  will be under more pressure to find ways to eliminate contaminants from our environment. Bioremediation microbes will continue to be used in an attempt to  return our polluted environments to their original state. <a href="http://www.opticsplanet.net/corning-glass-inc-list.html"><u>Corning</u></a>, <a href="http://www.opticsplanet.net/barnstead-list.html"><u>Barnstead</u></a>, and <a href="http://www.opticsplanet.net/bd-list.html"><u>BD</u></a> supply products used by  those researching bioremediation.<br />
Bioremediation  technologies can be generally classified as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"><em>in situ</em></a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_situ"><em>ex situ</em></a>. <em>In situ</em> bioremediation  involves treating the contaminated material at the site while <em>ex situ</em> involves the removal of the contaminated material to be treated elsewhere. Some  examples of bioremediation technologies are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioventing">bioventing</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfarming">landfarming</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioreactor">bioreactor</a>, Composting,  bioaugumentation, rhizofiltration, and biostimulation.</p>

				<p><strong>BIOREMEDIATION  STRATEGIES</strong><br />
         <br />
         Different techniques are employed depending on the degree of  saturation and aeration of an area. <em>In situ </em>techniques are defined as  those that are applied to soil and groundwater at the site with minimal  disturbance. <em>Ex situ </em>techniques are those that are applied to soil and  groundwater at the site which has been removed from the site via excavation  (soil) or pumping (water). <em>Bioaugmentation </em>techniques involve the  addition of microorganisms with the ability to degrade pollutants.<br />
<strong><em>In situ </em></strong><strong>bioremediation</strong><br />
These techniques are  generally the most desirable options due to lower cost and less disturbance  since they provide the treatment in place avoiding excavation and transport of  contaminants. <em>In situ</em>treatment is limited by the depth of the soil that  can be effectively treated. In many soils effective oxygen diffusion for  desirable rates of bioremediation extend to a range of only a few centimeters  to about 30 cm into the soil, although depths of 60 cm and greater have been  effectively treated in some cases. The most important land treatments are:</p>
				<p><strong>Incineration                                  Excavation</strong><br />
                  <img width="200" height="150" src="lec30_clip_image002_0000.jpg" alt="Description: C:\Users\SHASHI\Pictures\semi\rsignonthesite.jpg" /> <img width="205" height="154" src="lec30_clip_image004.jpg" alt="Description: C:\Users\SHASHI\Pictures\semi\excavation.jpg" /> <br />
Bioventing<br />
         Is the most common <em>in situ </em>treatment  and involves supplying air and nutrients through wells to contaminated soil to  stimulate the indigenous bacteria. Bioventing employs low airflow rates and  provides only the amount of oxygen necessary for the biodegradation while  minimizing volatilization and release of contaminants to the atmosphere. It  works for simple hydrocarbons and can be used where the contamination is deep  under the surface. <img width="352" height="251" src="lec30_clip_image006.png" alt="Description: C:\Users\SHASHI\Pictures\semi\Principle_of_bioventing.gif" /> <br />
In  situ biodegradation<br />
         Involves supplying oxygen and nutrients by  circulating aqueous solutions through contaminated soils to stimulate naturally  occurring bacteria to degrade organic contaminants. It can be used for soil and  groundwater. Generally, this technique includes conditions such as the infiltration  of water-containing nutrients and oxygen or other electron acceptors for  groundwater treatment.<br />
Biosparging. <br />
         Biosparging involves the injection of air under pressure  below the water table to increase groundwater oxygen concentrations and enhance  the rate of biological degradation of contaminants by naturally occurring  bacteria. Biosparging increases the mixing in the saturated zone and there- by  increases the contact between soil and groundwater. The ease and low cost of  installing small-diam- eter air injection points allows considerable  flexibility in the design and construction of the system.<br />
Bioaugmentation. <br />
Bioremediation  frequently involves the addition of microorganisms indigenous or exogenous to  the contaminated sites. Two factors limit the use of added microbial cultures  in a land treatment unit: 1) nonindigenous cultures rarely compete well enough  with an indigenous population to develop and sustain useful population levels  and 2) most soils with long-term exposure to biodegradable waste have  indigenous microorganisms that are effective degrades if the land treatment  unit is well managed.<br />
<img width="345" height="173" src="lec30_clip_image007.gif" alt="Description: C:\Users\SHASHI\Pictures\semi\bioaugmentation.gif" /> <br />
<strong>Ex  situ </strong><strong>bioremediation</strong><br />
These techniques involve  the excavation or removal of contaminated soil from ground. <br />
Landfarming<br />
<img width="405" height="279" src="lec30_clip_image009.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="Description: C:\Users\SHASHI\Pictures\semi\land-farming-cultivation-green-greenery.jpg" />Is a simple technique in which contaminated  soil is excavated and spread over a prepared bed and periodically tilled until  pollutants are degraded. The goal is to stimulate indigenous biodegradative  microorganisms and facilitate their aerobic degradation of contaminants. In  general, the practice is limited to the treatment of superficial 10–35 cm of  soil. Since landfarming has the potential to reduce monitoring and maintenance  costs, as well as clean-up liabilities, it has received much attention as a  disposal alternative. <br />
Composting<br />
         Is a technique that involves combining  contaminated soil with nonhazardous organic amendants such as manure or agricultural  wastes. The presence of these organic materials supports the development of a  rich microbial population and elevated temperature characteristic of  composting. <br />
Biopile <br />
         Are a hybrid of landfarming and composting. Essentially,  engineered cells are constructed as aerated composted piles. Typically used for  treatment of surface contamination with petro- leum hydrocarbons they are a  refined version of landfarming that tend to control physical losses of the  contaminants by leaching and volatilization. Biopiles provide a favorable  environment for indigenous aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. </p>
				<p><img width="381" height="249" src="lec30_clip_image002_0001.jpg" alt="Description: biopiles" /> <br />
Bioreactors<br />
         Slurry reactors or aqueous  reactors are used for <em>ex situ </em>treatment of contaminated soil and water  pumped up from a contaminated plume. Bioremediation in reactors involves the  processing of contaminated solid material (soil, sediment, sludge) or water  through an engineered containment system. A slurry bioreactor may be defined as  a containment vessel and apparatus used to create a three-phase (solid, liquid,  and gas) mixing condition to increase the bioremediation rate of soil- bound  and water-soluble pollutants as a water slurry of the contaminated soil and  biomass (usually indigenous microorganisms) capable of degrading target  contaminants. In general, the rate and extent of biodegradation are greater in  a bioreactor system than <em>in situ </em>or in solid-phase systems because the  contained environment is more manageable and hence more controllable and  predictable. Despite the advantages of reactor systems, there are some  disadvantages. The contaminated soil requires pre treatment (e.g., excavation)  or alternatively the contaminant can be stripped from the soil via soil washing  or physical extraction (e.g., vacuum extraction) before being placed in a  bioreactor.</p>

				<p><strong>Advantages of bioremediation</strong><br />
				  •        Bioremediation is a natural process and is therefore  perceived by the public as an acceptable waste treatment process for  contaminated material such as soil. Microbes able to degrade the contaminant  increase in numbers when the contaminant is present; when the contaminant is  degraded, the biodegradative population declines. The residues for the  treatment are usually harmless products and include carbon dioxide, water, and  cell biomass.<br />
				  •        Theoretically, bioremediation is useful for the complete  destruction of a wide variety of contaminants. Many compounds that are legally  considered to be hazardous can be transformed to harmless products. This  eliminates the chance of future liability associated with treatment and disposal  of contaminated material.<br />
				  •        Instead of transferring contaminants from one environmental  medium to another, for example, from land to water or air, the complete  destruction of target pollutants is possible.<br />
				  •        Bioremediation can often be carried out on site, often  without causing a major disruption of nor- mal activities. This also eliminates  the need to transport quantities of waste off site and the poten- tial threats  to human health and the environment that can arise during transportation.<br />
				  •        Bioremediation can prove less expensive than other  technologies that are used for clean-up of hazardous waste.<strong></strong><br />
  <strong>Disadvantages of  bioremediation</strong><br />
				  •        Bioremediation is limited to those compounds that are  biodegradable. Not all compounds are susceptible to rapid and complete  degradation.<br />
				  •        There are some concerns that the products of biodegradation  may be more persistent or toxic than the parent compound.<br />
				  •        Biological processes are often highly specific. Important  site factors required for success include the presence of metabolically capable  microbial populations, suitable environmental growth conditions, and  appropriate levels of nutrients and contaminants.<br />
				  •        It is difficult to extrapolate from bench and pilot-scale  studies to full-scale field operations. <br />
				  •        Research is needed to develop and engineer bioremediation  technologies that are appropriate for sites with complex mixtures of  contaminants that are not evenly dispersed in the environment.<br />
				  Contaminants may be  present as solids, liquids, and gases.<br />
				  •       Bioremediation  often takes longer than other treatment options, such as excavation and removal<br />
				  of soil or incineration.<br />
				  •       Regulatory  uncertainty remains regarding acceptable performance criteria for  bioremediation.<br />
				  There  is no accepted definition of “clean”, evaluating performance of bioremediation  is difficult, and there are no acceptable endpoints for bioremediation  treatments. </p>
