				<p>Genetic  engineering - was made possible through a series of scientific advances  including the discovery of DNA and the creation of the first recombinant  bacteria in 1973, i.e., E .coli expressing a salmonella gene. This led to  concerns in the scientific community about potential risks from genetic  engineering.<strong></strong><br />
          <br />
A genetically modified organism (GMO) or genetically engineered  organism (GEO) is an organism (plant or animal) whose genetic material has been  altered using genetic engineering techniques. These modifications are generally  used to benefit medicine or food production. There is controversy about these  techniques, as there are fears of tampering with an organism's evolution, and  the long-term irreversible effects that could come from that tampering.<br />
          <br />
The general principle of producing a  GMO is to add a lot of genetic material into an organism's genome to generate  new traits. These techniques, generally known as recombinant DNA technology,  use DNA molecules from different sources, which are combined into one molecule  to create a new set of genes. This DNA is then transferred into an organism,  giving it modified or novel genes. Transgenic organisms, a subset of GMOs, are  organisms which have inserted DNA that originated in a different species. </p>
				<p><strong>Genetically modified bacteria</strong> were the first organisms to be modified in the laboratory, due to  their simple genetics. These organisms are now used for several purposes, and  are particularly important in producing large amounts of pure human <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">proteins</a> for use in medicine.The first example of this occurred in 1978  when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Boyer" title="Herbert Boyer">Herbert Boyer</a> working at a University of California laboratory took a version  of the human <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin" title="Insulin">insulin</a> gene and inserted into the bacterium <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli" title="Escherichia coli"><em>Escherichia coli</em></a> to produce synthetic &quot;human&quot; insulin.The drug industry  has made good use of this discovery in its quest to cure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes" title="Diabetes">diabetes</a>. Similar bacteria have been used to produce <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation" title="Coagulation">clotting  factors</a> to treat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilia" title="Haemophilia">haemophilia</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_growth_hormone" title="Human growth hormone">human growth hormone</a> to  treat various forms of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarfism" title="Dwarfism">dwarfism</a>. These recombinant proteins are safer than the products they  replaced, since the older products were purified from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver" title="Cadaver">cadavers</a> and could transmit diseases. Indeed the human-derived proteins  caused many cases of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C" title="Hepatitis C">hepatitis C</a> in haemophilliacs and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creutzfeldt-Jakob_disease" title="Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</a> from human growth hormone. <br />
                  For instance, the bacteria which cause <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_decay" title="Tooth decay">tooth decay</a> are called <em>Streptococcus mutans</em>. These bacteria consume  leftover sugars in the mouth, producing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid" title="Lactic acid">lactic acid</a> that corrodes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel" title="Tooth enamel">tooth enamel</a> and ultimately causes cavities. Scientists have recently modified <em>Streptococcus mutans</em> to produce no lactic acid. These transgenic  bacteria, if properly colonized in a person's mouth, could reduce the formation  of cavities. Transgenic microbes have also been used in recent research to kill  or hinder tumors, and to fight <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease" title="Crohn's disease">Crohn's disease</a>. Genetically modified bacteria are also used in some soils to  facilitate crop growth, and can also produce  chemicals which are toxic to crop pests.<br />
                  <strong><u><br />
                Moving Genes  between Species—how to do……</u></strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The process by which scientists  introduce new genetic material into a microorganism is called <strong><em>molecular  or gene cloning or genetic engineering</em></strong>. </li>
				  <li>It involves the isolation of DNA from  a source other than the microorganism itself. Source organisms span the world  of living things, from microbes to plants to animals, including humans.  Scientists obtain source DNA in several different ways: by <strong>disrupting cells</strong> of the target microbe (or plant or animal) and <strong>fragmenting it into small pieces</strong>, by <strong>synthesizing it from an RNA template using  an enzyme called</strong> <strong>reverse  transcriptase</strong>, or by knowing the specific gene sequence and synthesizing it  directly in the laboratory.</li>
				  <li>Once obtained, the pieces of DNA are  inserted into a small genetic component that has the ability to make copies of  itself (replicate) independently from the microbial genome. This  self-replicating unit is called a cloning vector. Although these genetic  elements exist naturally in the form of <strong>plasmids</strong> and bacterial viruses,  many of the ones used today have been altered to improve their properties for  transferring genes. <strong>Restriction enzymes</strong>, which nick the donor DNA and  the cloning vector at specific sites, and DNA ligase, which attaches the donor  DNA to the cloning vector, allow the source genes of interest to be inserted  into the cloning vector without disrupting its ability to replicate.</li>
				  <li>The next step in the process is the  introduction of the cloning vector with its segment of new DNA into a living  cell. Bacteria have the ability to transport DNA into their cells in a process  called transformation, and this ability is commonly exploited to achieve this  goal. Getting the DNA into the cell, however, is only the beginning. No  transformation is 100 percent efficient, and so the bacteria that receive the  gene(s) of interest must be separated from those that did not. One of the best  studied and most commonly used cloning vectors, pBR322, is especially useful  for this purpose, as it contains several genes for antibiotic resistance.  Hence, any cell transformed with DNA containing pBR322 will be antibiotic  resistant, and thus can be isolated from similar cells that have not be so  transformed by merely growing them in the presence of the appropriate drugs.  All that remains is to identify bacteria that are producing the product of the  desired gene(s), and cloning is a success.</li>
				  <li>The introduction of human genes into  bacteria has several complicating wrinkles that make cloning them even more  challenging. For example, a bacterial gene codes for a protein from start to  finish in one long string of <strong>nucleotides</strong>, whereas human cells have  stretches of noncoding nucleotides called introns within their genes. Bacteria  do not have the same ability as human cells to remove these introns when  producing proteins from the gene, and if the introns are not removed, the  intended protein cannot be produced. This, along with other complications, has  been overcome using many of the tools of genetic engineering.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Uses of GMOs</strong>: Examples of GMOs are highly diverse,  and include transgenic (genetically modified by recombinant DNA methods)  animals such as mice, fish, transgenic plants, or various microbes, such as  fungi and bacteria. The generation and use of GMOs has many reasons, chief  among them are their use in research that addresses fundamental or applied  questions in biology or medicine, for the production of pharmaceuticals and  industrial enzymes, and for direct, and often controversial, applications aimed  at improving human health (e.g., gene therapy) or agriculture (e.g., golden  rice). The term &quot;genetically modified organism&quot; does not always  imply, but can include, targeted insertions of genes from one into another  species. For example, a gene from a jellyfish, encoding a fluorescent protein  called GFP, can be physically linked and thus co-expressed with mammalian genes  to identify the location of the protein encoded by the GFP-tagged gene in the  mammalian cell. These and other methods are useful and indispensable tools for biologists  in many areas of research, including those that study the mechanisms of human  and other diseases or fundamental biological processes in eukaryotic or  prokaryotic cells. </p>

				<p>Did you know that this is a is a nickname given to a variant of  the common <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterium" title="Bacterium">bacterium</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_syringae" title="Pseudomonas syringae"><em>Pseudomonas syringae</em></a> (<em>P. syringae</em>). This strain of <em>P. syringae</em> lacks the  ability to produce a certain surface <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a>, usually found on wild-type <em>P. syringae</em>. The  &quot;ice-plus&quot; protein (In a protein, &quot;Ice nucleation-active&quot;  protein) found on the outer bacterial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_wall" title="Cell wall">cell wall</a> acts as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleation" title="Nucleation">nucleating centers</a> for ice crystals. This facilitates ice formation, hence the  designation &quot;ice-plus.&quot; The ice-minus variant of <em>P. syringae</em> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant" title="Mutant">mutant</a>, lacking the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene" title="Gene">gene</a> responsible for ice-nucleating surface protein production. This  lack of surface protein provides a less favorable environment for ice  formation. Both strains of <em>P. syringae</em> occur naturally, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA_technology" title="Recombinant DNA technology">recombinant DNA technology</a> has allowed for the synthetic removal or alteration of specific  genes, enabling the creation of the ice-minus strain. Modifying <em>P. syringae</em> may have unexpected consequences for climate. A study has shown that its ice  nucleating proteins may play an important part in causing ice crystals to form  in clouds. If humans increase the frequency of bacteria lacking these proteins  then it may affect rainfall<br />
                    </p>
				<p><strong>Commercial Applications</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Transgenic microbes have many  commercial and practical applications, including the production of mammalian  products. A company called Genentech was among the earliest and most successful  commercial enterprises to use genetically engineered bacteria to produce human  proteins. Their first product was human insulin produced by genetically  engineered <em>Escherichia coli</em>. A variety of other human <strong>hormones</strong>,  blood proteins, and immune modulators are now produced in a similar fashion, in  addition to vaccines for such infectious agents as hepatitis B virus and  measles.</li>
				  <li>Another promising application of  genetically engineered microbes is in environmental cleanup, or biomediation.  Scientists have discovered many naturally occurring genes that code for enzymes  that degrade toxic wastes and wastewater pollutants in bacteria. Examples  include genes for degrading chlorinated pesticides, chlorobenzenes,  naphthalene, toluene, anilines, and various hydrocarbons. Researchers are using  molecular cloning to introduce these genes from several different microbes into  a single microbe, creating &quot;super microbes&quot; with the ability to  degrade multiple contaminants.</li>
				  <li>Ananda Chakrabarty created one of the  first microbes of this nature in the early 1970s. He introduced genes from  several different bacteria into a strain of <em>Burkholderia cepacia</em>, giving  it the ability to degrade toxic compounds found in petroleum. This microbe  offered a potential alternative to skimming and absorbing spilled oil.  Chakrabarty's genetically modified bacterium has never been used, however, due  to public concerns about the release of genetically engineered microbes into  the environment. The microbe did, on the other hand, play an important role in  establishing the biotechnology industry. The U.S. Patent Office granted Chakrabarty  the first patent ever for the construction and use of a genetically engineered  bacterium. This established a precedent allowing biotechnology companies to  protect their &quot;inventions&quot; in the same way chemical and  pharmaceutical companies have done in the past.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>          In addition to bacteria being used for  producing proteins, genetically modified viruses allow gene therapy. Gene  therapy is a relatively new idea in medicine. A virus reproduces by injecting  its own genetic material into an existing cell. That cell then follows the  instructions in this genetic material and produces more viruses. In medicine  this process is adapted to deliver a gene that could cure disease into human  cells. Although gene therapy is still relatively new, it has had some successes.  It has been used to treat genetic disorders such as severe combined  immunodeficiency, and treatments are being developed for a range of other  incurable diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and muscular  dystrophy. <br />
				  Genetically modified bacteria are also  used in agriculture to facilitate crop growth, and can also produce chemicals  which are toxic to crop pests. </p>
				<h4><a name="Transgenic_animals" id="Transgenic_animals"></a><a href="http://biology-animations.blogspot.com/search/label/transgenic%20animals">Transgenic  animals</a> </h4>
				<p>          Transgenic animals are used as  experimental models to perform phenotypic tests with genes whose function is  unknown or to generate animals that are susceptible to certain compounds or  stresses for testing in biomedical research. Other applications include the  production of human hormones, such as insulin. Frequently used in genetic  research are transgenic fruit flies (<em>Drosophila  melanogaster</em>) as genetic models to study the effects of genetic changes on  development. Transgenic mice are often used to study cellular and tissue-specific  responses to disease. </p>
				<h4><a name="Transgenic_plants" id="Transgenic_plants"></a>Transgenic plants </h4>
				<p>          Transgenic plants have been developed  for various purposes. Most of transgenic plants were created for research  purposes and were not intended for eventual commercialization. From these few  which have reached the market the most common transgenic traits include 1)  resistance to pests or herbicides, 2) improved product shelflife. In the near  future crops with improved nutritional value and with resitance to harsh  environmental conditions might reach the marketplace. Since the first  commercial cultivation of GM plants in 1996, GM plants tolerant to the  herbicides glufosinate or glyphosate, and producing the Bt toxin, an  insecticide, have dominated the agriculutral seed market for corn and other  crops (soybean, cotton). Recently, a new generation of GM plants promising  benefits for consumers and industry purposes is entering the market. Whenever  GM plants are grown on open fields without containment there are risks that the  modification will escape into the general environment. Most countries require  biosafety studies prior to the approval of a new GM plant release, usually  followed by a monitoring programme to detect environmental impacts. Especially  in Europe, the coexistence of GM plants with  conventional and organic crops has raised many concerns. Since there is  separate legislation for GM crops and a high demand from consumers for the  freedom of choice between GM and non-GM foods, measures are required to  separate foods and feed produced from GMO plants from conventional and organic  foods. European research programmes such as Co-Extra, Transcontainer and SIGMEA  are investigating appropriate tools and rules. </p>
				<a name="Controversy_over_GMOs" id="Controversy_over_GMOs"></a><strong>Controversy over GMOs 
				</strong>
				<p><a name="Government_for_and_ban_of_GMOs" id="Government_for_and_ban_of_GMOs"></a><br />          
				  The use of GMOs has sparked  significant controversy in many areas. Some groups or individuals see the  generation and use of GMO as intolerable meddling with biological states or  processes that have naturally evolved over long periods of time (although many  crops and animals have been modified by humans via unnatural selection over the  last several thousand years), while others are concerned about the limitations  of modern science to fully comprehend all of the potential negative  ramifications of genetic manipulation. <br />
				  <br />
			    While some groups advocate the  complete prohibition of GMOs, others call for mandatory labeling of genetically  modified food or other products. Other controversies include the definition of  patent and property pertaining to products of genetic engineering and the  possibility of unforeseen local and global effects as a result of transgenic  organisms proliferating. The basic ethical issues involved in genetic research  are discussed in the article on genetic engineering.</p>
