				<p><a href="http://biology-animations.blogspot.com/search?q=recombination"><strong>Transfer  of Genetic Material in Bacteria</strong></a><strong> </strong><br />
          The process of transfer of genetic  material and recombination is very interesting bascterial recombination is  given <strong>(PPT. an overview of bacterial recombination)</strong>.The  three main mechanisms by which bacteria acquire new DNA are transformation, conjugation, and transduction. Transformation involves  acquisition of DNA from the environment, conjugation involves acquisition of  DNA directly from another bacterium, and transduction involves acquisition of  bacterial DNA via a bacteriophage intermediate.<br />
<strong>Transformation</strong><br />
          Transformation is the process by which  bacteria pick up DNA from their environment. The DNA may come from a variety of  sources, but most likely it is the remnants of DNA from dead bacterial cells. <br />
<img width="470" height="526" src="lec11_clip_image002.jpg" />          </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<br clear="all" />
                <p>In  order to become successfully transformed, bacteria must be <strong>competent</strong>.  This means that the bacteria are expressing the appropriate enzymes (the  'transformation machinery') required to transport the exogenous DNA into the  cell. Therefore, the correct genes must be expressed in order to carry out  transformation. Expression of these genes depends on the growth conditions:  bacteria most likely to be competent are dividing rapidly, but nutrients in the  environment are becoming limited. (For more on the control of gene expression,  see the module on bacterial gene regulation.<br />
                  In transformation, a cell surface  receptor binds to DNA in the environment. After binding, the DNA is transported  across the membrane by the transformation machinery. As this occurs, one strand  of the DNA is digested away by an exonuclease, so that the DNA that enters the  cell is single stranded. This promotes recombination, as long as the DNA taken  up is sufficiently homologous to the host DNA to allow recombination to occur.  The recombination that occurs is one-way (non-reciprocal); unlike the exchange  of strands diagrammed in the module on recombination, in this case the new DNA  will simply replace a strand of the host DNA. The replaced segment of host DNA  will be degraded. If the new DNA is of a different allelic nature than the host  DNA, a gene conversion event can occur. This is what happened in the example  mentioned above: the avirulent strain of <em>S. pneumoniae</em> had a mutation in  a gene required for production of the bacterial capsule. Heat killing the  virulent cells (which contained the wild-type capsule gene) caused the release  of fragments of the dead cells' genomes. Some of the avirulent cells picked up  a piece of DNA containing the wild-type capsule gene, and underwent gene  conversion so that they were wild type for that gene, causing them to become  virulent.<br />
  <a href="http://biology-animations.blogspot.com/search?q=conjugation"><strong>Conjugation</strong></a> <strong></strong><br />
                  Conjugation is a mating process  involving bacteria. It involves transfer of genetic information from one  bacterial cell to another, and requires physical contact between the two  bacteria involved. The contact between the cells is via a protein tube called an <strong>F </strong>or <strong>sex pilus</strong>, which is also the conduit for the transfer of the  genetic material.<br />
                  Basic conjugation involves two strains  of bacteria: <strong>F+</strong> and <strong>F-</strong>. The difference between these two strains  is the presence of a <strong>Fertility factor </strong>(or F factor) in the F+ cells. The  F factor is an episome that contains 19 genes and confers the ability to  conjugate upon its host cell. Genetic transfer in conjugation is from an F+  cell to an F- cell, and the genetic material transferred is the F  factor itself. Here is an overview of the process:</p>
                <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
                  <tr>
                    <td><br />
                      Basic conjugation occurs between an F+ cell and an F-    cell. The difference between these two types of cells is the presence or    absence of the F (fertility) factor, which is a circular DNA molecule    independent of the bacterial chromosome (the larger circular molecule. </td>
                    <td><p><img border="0" width="203" height="135" src="lec11_clip_image004.jpg" /> </p></td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td><p>The F+ cell initiates conjugation by extending an F    pilus toward the F- cell. Among the genes present on the F factor are the    genes encoding the proteins required for pilus construction.</p></td>
                    <td><p><img border="0" width="174" height="144" src="lec11_clip_image006.jpg" /> </p></td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td><p>The    F pilus, when finished, temporarily connects the two cells. On strand of the    F factor is nicked, and begins unwinding from the other strand. The nicked    strand begins to transfer through the F pilus to the F- cell.

                    <td><p><img border="0" width="181" height="150" src="lec11_clip_image008.jpg" /> </p></td>

                  <tr>
                    <td><p>Eventually,    the nicked strand completely passes through to the recipient cell, and is    completely replicated. This process produces a new F factor in the recipient    cell. The pilus is broken, severing the connection between the two cells.    Since both cells now contain an F factor, both cells are F+. The new F+ cell    (which was the F- cell, can now initiate conjugation with another F- cell.</p></td>
                    <td><p><img border="0" width="181" height="150" src="lec11_clip_image010.jpg" /> </p></td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
                <p>          Recombination rarely occurs with this  kind of conjugation. This is because the F factor is not homologous to the DNA  in the bacterial chromosome. As we will see, however, there are variations of  this basic conjugation process that allow recombination to occur.<br />
                    <strong>Conjugation Involving Hfr Bacteria</strong> <br />
                  Occasionally, the F factor integrates  into a random position in the bacterial chromosome. When this happens, the  bacterial cell is called Hfr instead of F+. Hfr bacteria are still able to  initiate conjugation with F- cells, but the outcome is completely different  from conjugation involving F+ bacteria:</p>
                <div align="center">
                  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

                      <td valign="top"><br />
                        As    mentioned above, Hfr cells are formed when the F factor integrates into the    bacterial chromosome. This integration occurs at a random location. </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td valign="top"><p>The    Hfr cell is still able to initiate conjugation with an F- cell.</p></td>

                    <tr>
                      <td valign="top"><p>When    DNA transfer begins, the Hfr cell tries to transfer the <strong>entire bacterial    chromosome</strong> to the F- cell. The first DNA to be transferred is chromosomal    DNA, and the <strong>last</strong> DNA to be transferred will be the <strong>F factor</strong> DNA.</p></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td valign="top"><p>Transfer    of the bacterial chromosome is <strong>almost never</strong> complete. Pili are fairly    fragile structures, and shear forces tend to break the pilus, disrupting DNA    transfer before the entire chromosome can be transferred. As a result, the F    factor itself is almost never transferred to the recipient cell. This cell    will remain F-. This cell will receive new DNA from the Hfr cell however, and    this new DNA can undergo recombination at a high frequency with the host chromosome,    because the DNA sequences will be homologous. In fact, Hfr is short for 'high    frequency recombination'. This recombination can result in gene conversion    events, if the transferred DNA and the corresponding region of host DNA    contain different alleles of the same gene.</p></td>

                </div>
                <p><strong>Mapping Genes on Bacterial Chromosomes</strong> <br />
                  Bacteria, since they are usually  haploid, cannot have their chromosomes mapped by the same techniques as  eukaryotes (For a reminder of how this works, see the module on linkage and  mapping). They can, however, be mapped by using Hfr bacterial conjugation. For  example, imagine that an F- cell has mutant alleles of two genes, <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> (the F- would therefore be <em>a</em>-, <em>b</em>-). If this cell undergoes  conjugation with an Hfr cell that is <em>a</em>+, <em>b</em>+ (in other words, wild  type), the F- cell should undergo gene conversion to <em>a</em>+, <em>b</em>+ when  both of those genes have been transferred by conjugation. By determining how  long it takes the <em>b</em> gene to transfer after the <em>a</em> gene has  transferred, it is possible to get a relative idea of how far apart the two  genes are on a chromosome. <br />
                  The experiment would be done this way: <em>a</em>+, <em>b</em>+ Hfr cells would be mixed with <em>a</em>-,<em>b</em>- F-  cells. The time of mixing would be designated 'time zero'. At regular  intervals, a small amount of the mixture would be removed and conjugation would  be disrupted using a blender (the shear force of the blender would cause any  pili to break). These bacteria would then be tested for gene conversion (for  example, if the mutations rendered the F- bacteria auxotrophic, the bacteria  could be tested by growing them on minimal medium, or minimal medium  supplemented with the necessary nutrient required because of one or the other  mutation). If the <em>a</em> gene was converted to wild type at 8 minutes after  time zero, and the <em>b</em> gene was converted to wild type at 19 minutes after  time zero, then the distance between the two genes would be '11 minutes'  (because that was the difference in time required to transfer the <em>b</em> gene  compared to the <em>a</em> gene). Bacterial map distances are always expressed in  minutes, because of this technique.<br />
  <strong>F' Conjugation</strong> <br />
                  Just as F factors can occasionally  integrate into the bacterial chromosome (producing an Hfr cell from an F+  cell), integrated F factors can occasionally excise themselves from the  bacterial chromosome. If this excision occurs properly, the Hfr cell becomes an  F+ again. The excision is sometimes sloppy, however, and the F factor takes a  small segment of the bacterial chromosome with it. Some of the chromosomal DNA  has therefore become associated with the episome. When this happens, the cell  is called an F'. <br />
                  Conjugation  involving F' cells allows for the possibility of recombination, as shown below:</p>
                <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
                  <tr>
                    <td valign="top"><br />
                      The    F' cell has a full complement of chromosomal genes; however, some of those    genes are now on the episome. F' cells are able to initiate conjugation with    F- cells because of the presence of the F factor. </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td valign="top"><p>When    the F factor begins to transfer its DNA to the recipient cell, it will    transfer the small segment of chromosomal DNA as well.</p></td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td valign="top"><p>Just    as in the F+/F- mating, both cells wind up with a copy of the episome. The    cell that was F- now has the F factor (along with the piece of chromosomal    DNA) and is therefore now F'. This cell, however, also has a complete    chromosome, so it will be diploid for the segment of chromosomal DNA on the    episome. Such a partially diploid bacterial cell is called a merozygote. The    chromosomal DNA on the episome can undergo recombination at high frequency    with its homologous sequence on the chromosome.</p></td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
                <p><a href="http://biology-animations.blogspot.com/search?q=transduction"><strong>Transduction</strong></a> <br />
                  Transduction involves the exchange of  DNA between bacteria using bacterial viruses (bacteriophage) as an  intermediate. There are two types of transduction, generalized transduction and  specialized transduction, which differ in their mechanism and in the DNA that  gets transferred. Before we can address these processes, however, we need to understand  the life cycle of a bacteriophage.<br />
                  When a phage infects a bacterial cell,  it injects its DNA into the cell. The viral DNA is replicated numerous times,  and viral genes are expressed, producing the proteins that make up the viral  capsid (or protein coat) and nucleases that digest the host genome into  fragments. The newly replicated viral DNA molecules are packaged into viral  capsids, and the bacterial cell is lysed (burst, and therefore killed),  releasing hundreds of viral progeny, which then go on to infect other cells.<br />
  <strong>Generalized Transduction</strong> <br />
                  Sometimes, during bacteriophage  replication, a mistake is made, and a fragment of the host DNA gets packaged  into a viral capsid. The resulting phage would be able to infect another cell,  but it would not have any viral genes, so it would not be able to replicate.  The cell infected by this phage would survive, and would have an extra piece of  bacterial DNA present, which could undergo recombination with the host  chromosome, and perhaps cause a gene conversion event. Because it is a random  fragment that gets packaged into the viral capsid, any segment of the bacterial  DNA can be transferred this way (hence the name 'generalized').<br />
  <strong>Specialized Transduction</strong> <br />
                  Specialized transduction occurs only  with certain types of bacteriophage, such as phage <strong>lambda</strong>. Lambda has  the ability to establish what is called a <strong>lysogenic infection</strong> in a  bacterial cell. In a lysogenic infection, the viral DNA becomes incorporated  into the host chromosome, much as the F factor did in Hfr cells. In a lysogenic  infection by lambda, the DNA integrates into a very specific spot in the host  chromosome. The integrated viral DNA can remain integrated for long periods of  time, without disturbing the cell. Under the appropriate conditions (the regulation  of this is very complex, so don't worry about it), the viral DNA will excise  itself from the chromosome, and enter the <strong>lytic phase</strong>, in which the  virus replicates just as described above. The cell gets lysed, and new  bacteriophage particles are released to infect other cells. As with excision of  the F factor (when Hfr cells become F'), sometimes the excision of lambda is  sloppy, and some bacteria DNA is excised along with it. When the resulting  virus infects another cell, it will pass that bacterial DNA into the cell,  along with its own DNA. If the infected cell survives (it can happen; there are  bacterial defenses against viral infection), it will contain a new piece of  bacterial DNA, which can undergo recombination and possibly cause gene  conversion. Because the viral DNA integrates into a specific location, when it  excises, the bacterial DNA removed with it will be the same in all cases.  Therefore, the DNA transferred to the second cell will be the same segment of  the bacterial chromosome. This is why this process is called 'specialized'  transduction.<br />

                  Bacteria can pick up loose DNA in  their environment through the process of transformation. The newly acquired DNA  is rendered single stranded, and can recombine with the host chromosome. </p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Bacteria       can exchange DNA through the process of conjugation. The F factor confers       the ability to initiate conjugation. If the F factor alone is transferred,       no recombination will occur. Under certain circumstances, chromosomal DNA       can be transferred to the recipient cell. In these cases, recombination       will occur. </li>
                  <li>Bacteria       can receive bacterial DNA from viruses through the process of       transduction. Bacterial viruses can accidentally pick up pieces of       bacterial DNA. When they subsequently infect a cell, they transfer the       pice of bacterial DNA, which can undergo recombination with the host       bacterial chromosome. </li>
                  <li>The       result of recombination in the above cases may be gene conversion, in       which a mutant allele becomes wild-type or vice versa. </li>
                  <li>Conjugation       involving Hfr bacteria can be used to map genes along the bacterial chromosome.       This done by determining in what order genes are transferred during       conjugation, waht the time difference is between the transfer of genes. </li>

                <p>         Bacteria do not reproduce sexually but  can acquire new DNA through transformation, transduction or conjugation.These  natural processes have been modified so that DNA can be deliberately  incorporated into host microbes- even genes that   would normally never be transferred this way. </p>
