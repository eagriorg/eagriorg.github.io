				<p>Aerial plant  surfaces represent the largest biological interface on Earth and provide  essential services as sites of carbon dioxide fixation, molecular oxygen  release, and primary biomass production. Rather than existing as axenic  organisms, plants are colonized by microorganisms that affect both their health  and growth.<br />
</p>
				<p>For terrestrial  plants, the phyllosphere represents the interface between the above-ground  parts of plants and the air. Conservative estimates indicate that the roughly 1  billion square kilometers of worldwide leaf surfaces host more than 1026  bacteria, which are the most abundant colonizers of this habitat . The overall  microbiota in this ecosystem is thus sufficiently large to have an impact on  the global carbon and nitrogen cycles. Additionally, the phyllosphere  inhabitants influence their hosts at the level of the individual plants. To a  large extent, interest in phyllosphere microbiology has been driven by  investigations on plant pathogens. Their spread, colonization, survival, and  pathogenicity mechanisms have been the subject of numerous studies. Much less  understood are nonpathogenic microorganisms that inhabit the phyllosphere. The  composition of the phyllosphere microbiota has been analyzed in only a few studies  by cultivation-independent methods; however, such methods are essential in  light of the yet uncultivated majority of bacteria existing in nature, or more  specifically on plant leaves. Not only their identity, but in particular the  physiological properties of phyllosphere bacteria, their adaptations to the  habitat, and their potential role (e.g., with respect to modulating population  sizes of pathogens) remain largely unknown. Current knowledge on the traits  important in the phyllosphere is derived from relatively few studies on gene  expression and stems mostly from model bacteria cultivated on host plants under  controlled conditions. However, under natural conditions, plants and their  residing microorganisms are exposed to a host of diverse, highly variable  environmental factors, including UV light, temperature, and water availability;  moreover, individual microbes are subjected to competition with other  microorganisms over resources, such as nutrients and space.<br />
			    </p>
				<p>Toward a deeper  understanding of phyllosphere microbiology, and in particular to learn more  about the commensal majority of plant leaf colonizing bacteria, which may be of  relevance for plant health and development, integrated approaches are needed.  Here, <br />
			    </p>
				<p>Bacterial  communities in the phyllosphere are thought to be limited by carbon  availability, and it may be expected that access to carbon compounds on leaves  is a major determinant of epiphytic colonization. There is evidence that small  amounts of nutrients, such as simple sugars including glucose, fructose, and  sucrose, leach from the interior of the plant.</p>
				<p>				  The above-ground  parts of plants are normally colonized by a variety of bacteria, yeasts, and  fungi. While a few microbial species can be isolated from within plant tissues,  many more are recovered from the surfaces of healthy plants. The aerial habitat  colonized by these microbes is termed the phyllosphere, and the inhabitants are  called epiphytes. While there has been some investigation of the colonists of  buds and flowers, most work on phyllosphere microbiology has focused on leaves,  a more dominant aerial plant structure. Bacteria are by far the most numerous  colonists of leaves, often being found in numbers averaging 106 to  107 cells/cm2 (up to 108 cells/g) of leaf. Because of  their numerical dominance on leaves, and because more information is available  on the process of bacterial colonization of leaves, we focus on this group of  microbes in this review.<br />
			    </p>
				<p>Compared to most  other bacterial habitats, there has been relatively little examination of  phyllosphere microbiology. This is somewhat surprising given the abundance of  plants in the world and the roles of various phyllosphere bacteria in the  important processes discussed below. Leaves constitute a very large microbial  habitat. It is estimated that the terrestrial leaf surface area that might be  colonized by microbes is about 6.4 x 108 km2. Given the  large number of bacteria on leaves in temperate regions of the world and that  populations in tropical regions are probably even larger, the planetary  phyllosphere bacterial population may be as large as 1026 cells.  Clearly, in aggregate, these bacteria are sufficiently numerous to contribute  in many processes of importance to global processes, as well as to the behavior  of the individual plants on which they live.<br />
			    </p>
				<p>The microbial  communities of leaves are diverse and include many different genera of  bacteria, filamentous fungi, yeasts, algae, and, less frequently, protozoa and  nematodes. Filamentous fungi are considered transient inhabitants of leaf surfaces,  being present predominantly as spores, whereas rapidly sporulating species and  yeasts colonize this habitat more actively. Bacteria are by far the most  abundant inhabitants of the phyllosphere. Epiphytic bacterial populations  differ sharply in size among and within plants of the same species, as well as  in close proximity, and over short time scales as well as over the growing  season. These considerable variations in population sizes are caused in great  part by the large fluctuations in the physical and nutritional conditions  characteristic of the phyllosphere. Additionally, plant species appear to  influence the microbial carrying capacity of the leaf, since the total number  of culturable bacteria recovered from broad-leaf plants such as cucumber and  beans was significantly greater than that recovered from grasses or waxy  broad-leaf plants.<br />
				  Reflective of  marked differences in the physicochemical environments of above-ground versus  subterranean plant surfaces, the leaf bacterial flora differs substantially  from that of roots. For example, pigmented bacteria, which are rarely found in  the rhizosphere, dominate leaf surfaces, presumably because solar radiation  influences the ecology of the phyllosphere. The differential composition of  leaf and root bacterial communities is further evidenced by the failure of  common root colonizers such as <em>Rhizobium</em> and <em>Azospirillum</em> to become  established on leaves.<br />
			    </p>
				<p>Studies of the  composition of bacterial communities on leaves have been numerous but rather  limited in scope. It is generally believed that populations of culturable  aerobic bacteria on leaves are dominated by a few genera. A few exhaustive  studies of the variations in the microbial community of leaves over multiple  time and space scales have provided important detailed knowledge about the  identity and the ecology of bacterial leaf inhabitants. Ercolani made an  extensive inventory of culturable aerobic bacteria isolated from the surface of  olive leaves over six growing seasons and reported distinct bacterial community  structures on leaves of the same age at a given time of the growing season.  Thompson et al. analyzed 1,236 bacterial strains from immature, mature, and  senescent leaves of field-grown sugar beets over a complete growing season.  They identified 78 species and 37 named and 12 unnamed genera of bacteria. Most  importantly, like Ercolani, they found distinct patterns of microbial  colonization at different times of the year, with bacterial community diversity  being lowest during the warmest and driest months of the season and highest  during the cooler and rainy months. Coincidentally, in both of the  above-described studies, communities on young leaves were composed of a greater  number of taxa than those of old leaves. Thus, specific natural environments of  the phyllosphere apparently select for the presence of specific genotypes  within the leaf bacterial community. This is further supported by the finding  that the acquisition by Pseudomonas fluorescens of plasmids that are indigenous  to the leaf microflora coincided with a specific maturation stage of the plant  over two consecutive years. This indicated that traits carried on these  plasmids conferred variable selective fitness to specific plasmid-bacterial  host combinations during the growing season, possibly in response to changing  conditions in the phyllosphere habitat.<br />
			    </p>
				<p>The study of  bacterial colonizers of leaves has been restricted mostly to aerobic culturable  bacteria and also driven by the importance of investigating the ecology of  plant-pathogenic bacteria because of their deleterious effect on plant  productivity. Thus, the microbial ecology of the phyllosphere has been viewed  mainly through the biology of gram-negative bacteria such as <em>Pseudomonas syringae</em> and <em>Erwinia</em> (Pantoea) spp., two of the most  ubiquitous bacterial participants of phyllosphere communities. There is reason  to believe, however, that the extreme fluctuations in the physicochemical  environment of the phyllosphere over short time scales may select for bacterial  species that have unusual and versatile traits that make them fit to colonize  plant surfaces but have remained unculturable. The leaf surface has long been  considered a hostile environment for bacterial colonists. The leaf surface is  exposed to rapidly fluctuating temperature and relative humidity, as well as  repeated alternation between presence and absence of free moisture due to rain  and dew. The leaf also provides limited nutrient resources to bacterial  colonists. While other habitats probably offer more extreme conditions of desiccation  or temperature, etc., they may not be subject to such rapid and extreme  fluctuations in these several physical conditions. Several factors may  influence the microhabitat experienced by bacteria on leaves. First, the leaf  itself is surrounded by a very thin laminar layer in which moisture emitted  through stomata may be sequestered, thereby alleviating the water stress to  which epiphytes are exposed. Second, some cells in a leaf bacterial population,  particularly in plant-pathogenic populations, may not reside in exposed sites  on the leaf surface but instead may at least locally invade the interior of the  leaf, avoiding the stresses on the exterior of the leaf by residing in  substomatal chambers or other interior locations.  Thus, while some phytopathogens may have the  option of avoiding stresses, most other epiphytes apparently must tolerate them  in some way. <br />

				<p>The phyllosphere  has many features that make it an excellent habitat in which to study microbial  ecology. Leaves are clean, and microbes can be observed directly on leaves,  enabling the use of powerful new microscopic techniques to measure microbial  identity, activity, and gene expression. Plants can be readily grown without  epiphytic microbial communities, allowing us to readily manipulate their  inhabitants, while communities can be made as simple or complex as needed by  simple inoculation. In addition, important microbial processes, such as  immigration, and ecological models, such as island biogeography, can be readily  explored in epiphytic bacterial systems. Thus, phyllosphere microbiology has  much to offer to the field of microbial ecology and promises to contribute to  more effective and less environmentally damaging means of plant protection.<br />
