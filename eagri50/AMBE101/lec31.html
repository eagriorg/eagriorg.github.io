				<p><strong>Biosensor</strong> is  an analytical device for the detection of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyte">analyte</a> that combines a  biological component with a physicochemical detector component<br />
                  <strong>It consists of  3 parts:</strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>The <em>sensitive biological element</em> (biological material (eg. tissue,  microorganisms, organelles, cell receptors, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme">enzymes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody">antibodies</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid">nucleic acids</a>, etc), a  biologically derived material or biomimic) the sensitive elements can be  created by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_engineering">biological  engineering</a>.</li>
				  <li>The <em>transducer</em> or the <em>detector element</em> (works in a physicochemical  way; optical, piezoelectric, electrochemical, etc.) that transforms the signal  resulting from the interaction of the analyte with the biological element into  another signal (i.e., transducers) that can be more easily measured and quantified;</li>
				  <li>Associated  electronics or signal processors that are primarily responsible for the display  of the results in a user-friendly way. This sometimes accounts for the most  expensive part of the sensor device, however it is possible to generate a user  friendly display that includes transducer and sensitive element (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_Sensor">Holographic Sensor</a>).</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>A  common example of a commercial biosensor is the blood glucose biosensor, which  uses the enzyme <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_oxidase">glucose oxidase</a> to break blood glucose down. In doing so it first oxidizes glucose and uses two  electrons to reduce the FAD (a component of the enzyme) to FADH2. This in turn  is oxidized by the electrode (accepting two electrons from the electrode) in a  number of steps. The resulting current is a measure of the concentration of  glucose. In this case, the electrode is the transducer and the enzyme is the  biologically active component.<br />
				  Recently,  arrays of many different detector molecules have been applied in so called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_nose">electronic nose</a> devices;  where the pattern of response from the detectors is used to fingerprint substance.  Current commercial electronic noses, however, do not use biological elements.<br />
  <strong>Principles of  Detection</strong> <br />
				  Analytical chemistry plays  an important role in food quality parameters because almost every sector of  industry and public service relies on quality control. A food quality biosensor  is a device, which can respond to some property or properties of food and  transform the response(s) into a detectable signal, often an electric signal.  This signal may provide direct information about the quality factor(s) to be  measured or may have a known relation to the quality factor. There are various  kinds of biosensors most of which work on the principle of one of the  following: <br />
  <strong>Electrochemical Biosensors</strong><br />
				  Electrochemical biosensors are based on monitoring  electroactive species that are either produced or consumed by the action of the  biological components (e.g., enzymes and cells). Transduction of the produced  signal can be performed using one of several methods under two broad headings:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Potentiometric Biosensors</strong></li>
				  <li><strong>Amperometric Biosensors</strong></li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>Potentiometric Biosensors</strong><br />
				  These are based on monitoring the potential of a system  at a working electrode, with respect to an accurate reference electrode, under  conditions of essentially zero current flow. In process, potentiometric  measurements are related to the analyte activity (of a target species) in the  test sample. Potentiometric biosensors can operate over a wide range (usually  several orders of magnitude) of concentrations. The use of potentiometric  biosensors for food quality analysis has not been as widely reported as for  amperometric sensors. However, some of the examples where this approach has  been used for food quality analysis include estimating monophenolase activity  in apple juice, determining the concentration of sucrose in soft drinks,  measuring isocitrate concentrations in fruit juices, and determining urea  levels in milk.</p>
				<p><strong>Amperometric Biosensors</strong><br />
				  The use of amperometric biosensors in signal transduction  has proved to be the most widely reported using an electrochemical approach.  Both “one-shot” (disposable) sensors and on-line (multi measurement) devices  are commercially available, monitoring a wide range of target analytes. In contrast  to potentiometric devices, the principle operation of amperometric biosensors  is defined by a constant potential applied between a working and a reference  electrode. The applied potential results in redox reactions, causing a net  current to flow. The magnitude of this current is proportional to the concentration  of electro active species present in test solution and both cathodic (reducing)  and anodic (oxidizing) reactions can be monitored amperometrically. Most of the  amperometric biosensors described use enzymes as the biorecognition element.  Typically, oxidase and dehydrogenase enzymes have been the most frequently  exploited catalysts used for these biosensor formats.<br />
  <strong>Calorimetric Biosensors</strong><br />
				  Most of the biochemical reactions are accompanied by  either heat absorption or production. Sensors based on calorimetric  transduction are designed to detect heat generated or consumed during a  biological reaction; by using sensitive heat detection devices. Various  biosensors for specific target analytes have been constructed. In the field of food  quality analysis, uses of such biosensors to detect metabolites have been  described.<br />
  <strong>Optical Biosensors</strong><br />
				  These sensors are based on measuring responses to  illumination or to light emission. Optical biosensors can employ a number of  techniques to detect the presence of a target analyte and are based on  well-founded methods including chemiluminescence, fluorescence, light  absorbance, phosphoresence, photothermal techniques, surface plasmon resonance  (SPR), light polarization and rotation, and total internal reflectance. For  example the use of this technique has been demonstrated to detect the presence  of allergens, in particular peanuts, during food production.<br />
  <strong>Acoustic Biosensors</strong><br />
				  Piezoelectric quartz crystals can be affected by a  change of mass at the crystal surface; this phenomenon has been successfully  exploited and used to develop acoustic biosensors. For practical applications,  the surface of the crystal can be modified with recognition elements (e.g.,  antibodies) that can bind specifically to a target analyte.<br />
  <strong>Immunosensors</strong><br />
				  Immunosensors are based on exploiting the specific  interaction of antibodies with antigens. Typically, immunoassays (such as the  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique) employ a label (e.g., enzyme,  antibody, fluorescent marker) to detect the immunological reaction. The use of  biosensor platforms, linked to an immunoassay format, offers a route to rapid  and accurate quantitative measurements of target analytes. </p>
				<p><strong>Applications  of Biosensors</strong><br />
				  There are many potential applications of  biosensors of various types. The main requirements for a biosensor approach to  be valuable in terms of research and commercial applications are the  identification of a target molecule, availability of a suitable biological  recognition element, and the potential for disposable portable detection  systems to be preferred to sensitive laboratory-based techniques in some  situations. Some examples are given below:<strong> </strong></p>

				<p><strong>Utility Biosensors  for applications in Agriculture in Food/ Fruit Quality Control</strong><br />
				  Quality control is the essential part of a food industry  and efficient quality assurance is becoming increasingly important. Consumers  expect good quality and healthy food at a given price; with good shelf life and  high safety while food inspections require good manufacturing practices,  safety, labelling and compliance with the regulations. Further, food producers  are increasingly asking for efficient control methods, in particular through  on-line or at-line quality sensors. Their main aim is to satisfy the consumer  and regulatory requirements and to improve the production feasibility, quality  sorting, automation and reduction of production cost and production time  subsequently.<br />
  <strong>Biochemical Composition of Fruits</strong><br />
				  The quality of soft fruit, in terms of taste, nutrition  and consumers acceptance, is fundamentally based on the biochemical composition  of the fruit. In soft fruits (<em>viz</em>. blackcurrant and strawberry) sugar: acid  ratios can be used as an important index of fruit maturity and act as a  determinant of overall fruit. However, sugar: acid ratios are infrequently used  due to a requirement for specific instrumentation and semi-skilled analytical  scientists. Today we need a simple and low-cost alternative, which would significantly  enhance both the number and extent of tests carried out.</p>
				<p><strong>Fruit Maturity, Ripening and Quality Relationships</strong><br />
				  Fruit maturity at harvest is the most important factor  that determines shelf life and final fruit quality. If harvested immature then  fruits are more subject to shriveling and mechanical damage, and are of inferior  quality when ripe, whereas overripe fruits are liable to become soft and mealy  with bland flavour soon after harvest. Therefore, fruits harvested either too  early or too late in their season are more susceptible to post harvest physiological  disorders than fruits harvested at proper maturity. </p>
				<p><strong>Fruits can be  divided into two groups: </strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Fruit that are incapable of enduring their ripening process  once picked from the plant like berries, cheery, citrus fruits, grapes, lychee,  pineapple, pomegranate, and tamarillo. </li>
				  <li>Fruits that can be harvested mature and ripped off the  plant like apple, apricot, avocado, banana, cherimoya, guava, kiwifruit, mango,  nectarine, papaya, passion fruit, pear, peach, persimmon, plum, quince,  sapodilla, sapota. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p>Volatile compounds are responsible for the  characteristic aroma of fruits and are present in extremely small quantities  (&lt;100&lt; g/g fresh wt.). The major volatile formed is ethylene. Scientists  are trying to develop portable instruments with sensors that detect volatile  production by fruits and hence detecting maturity and quality. Other strategies  include the removal of a very small amount of fruit tissue and measurement of  total sugar or organic acid content.</p>
				<p><strong>Major organic acids in fruits</strong><br />
				  Organic acids function in growth, maturation, senescence,  color, and antimicrobial activity of fruits. The low pH of fruits is due to the  three most common organic acids present in fruits citric acid, malic acid, and  tartaric acid. The total amount of acid in fruits varies widely, from about  0.2% in pear juice to 0.8% in limejuice. The amount and type of acid present in  fruits determine the fresh taste of fruits and also affects the shelf life.</p>
				<p><strong>Organic Acid as an Indicator of Fruit Maturity</strong><br />
				  Organic acids directly play an important role in the  growth, maturation and acidity of the fruit, and also affect the shelf life of  the fruit by influencing the growth of microorganisms. The citric, malic,  oxalic, and tartaric acids ranging from 0.1 to 30 g/L were found in orange,  grape, and apple juices. There is a considerable difference in the organic acid  content found in various types and brands of fruit juice. For example, Minute  Maid contains higher levels of oxalic and citric acids when compared to all  other orange juices tested. Grape concentrate was found to have lower amount of  malic acid than other grape juice, while freshly squeezed grape juice contains  higher amount of tartaric acid. Brae burn apples contained the highest amount  of citric acid in apples; however Granny Smith apples were the overall most  acidic apples tested. </p>

				<p><strong>Successful Examples of Organic Acid Biosensors  Developed </strong><strong>Pyruvic Acid</strong><br />
				  Onion flavour is principally directed by the perception  of pungency. A disposable prototype electrochemical screen-printed (carbon-based)  biosensor (C2030519D5, GEM Ltd., Gwent, UK) was constructed using pyruvate dehydrogenase  immobilized on mediated Meldolas Blue electrodes and a combined Ag/AgCl reference/counter  electrode, both screen-printed onto a PVC substrate to determine pungency in  onions (Allium cepa L.). Electrochemical measurements were carried out using a  Palm Sense potentiostat (Palm Instruments BV, The Netherlands). The biosensor  developed was able to differentiate between mild and pungent bulbs with  pyruvate concentrations ranging between 4 and 8 mM in freshly extracted juices.  Electrochemical measurements were carried out at +50 mV at 21°C.<br />

				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Glucose Biosensors</strong><br />
				  Most of the glucose biosensors developed are based on  immobilized glucose oxidase. In many cases, glucose oxidase has been associated  with mediators so as to bring down the high working potential required for  hydrogen peroxide breakdown. The α-D glucose sensor developed was also based on  glucose oxidase, at the working potential of -350 mV vs. Ag/AgCl, hydrogen  peroxide was catalytically oxidized at a rhodinised carbon electrode (White et al,  1994). A novel and simple method which do not involve enzyme or monomer  modifications, for the coimmobilization of ferrocene and GOx in a poly(pyrrole)  matrix for use as glucose biosensor was developed (Foulds and Lowe, 1988). In  spite of the low conductivity of the polypyrrole film formed, the biosensor’s  performance was better than that of other devices reported due to redox  mediation of ferrocene that lowers the working potential to 0.4 V. The characterization  of the polymer prepared from an ethanolic suspension demonstrated the presence  of alcohol interferes in the polymerization kinetics (Pablo et al., 2001).  However, this played a beneficial role in efficient immobilization of both, the  enzyme and the ferrocene, in a very thin electroactive film. This fact improved  the biosensor’s time response, avoiding mass transport effects. A new type of  disposable amperometric biosensor was devised by screen-printing thick-film electrodes  directly on a porous nitrocellulose (NC) strip. A glucose biosensor based on  hydrogen peroxide detection was constructed by immobilizing glucose oxidase  (GOx) on the NC electrode strip and by formulating a strong oxidation layer  (i.e., PbO2) at the sample loading area, placed below the GOx reaction band.  The screen-printed PbO2 paste serves as a sample pretreatment layer that removes  interference by its strong oxidizingability. Samples applied were carried  chromatographically, via the PbO2 paste, to the GOx layer, and glucose was catalyzed  to liberate hydrogen peroxide, which was then detected at the electrode  surface. The proposed NC/ PbO2 strip sensor is shown to be virtually insusceptible  to interfering species such as acetaminophen and ascorbic and uric acids and to  exhibit good performance, in terms of the sensor to sensor reproducibility. The  characterization of metal-decorated CNTs was done using X-ray diffraction  analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM, scanning  electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. Amperometric  biosensor fabricated by depositing GOD over Nafion-solubilized Au-MWNT  electrode retained its biocatalytic activity and obtained fast and sensitive  glucose quantification. The fabricated GOD/Au- MWNT/Nafion electrode has a good  glucose biosensing potential, and it displayed a linear response up to 22 mM  glucose and a detection limit of 20 <em>ì</em>M method.</p>
				<p align="center"><img width="327" height="231" src="lec31_clip_image002_0000.png" /> </p>
				<p><strong>Sucrose Biosensor</strong><br />
				  Sucrose is an essential part of any fruit, so estimating  the concentration of sucrose at different maturity levels could help in  identifying the ripening parameters of fruits. Therefore, with regard to  sucrose detection, electrodes made up of invertase, mutarotase and glucose  oxidase and mediated tri-enzyme electrode based on sucrose phosphorylase and  electrocatalytic oxidation of NADH, have been used. Because real samples  contain both glucose and sucrose, sucrose sensors have been operated in tandem  with glucose oxidase sensors. The sucrose sensor developed was based on the  invertase, mutarotase and glucose oxidase reaction scheme and the sucrose level  was calculated with respect to the net glucose sensors.</p>
				<p><strong>Ascorbic Acid Sensor</strong><br />
				  Ascorbic acid has been measured both by direct electrochemical  oxidation and by enzymatic methods using ascorbate oxidase. In the first case,  an ascorbate oxidase electrode was used to measure the signal generated by  other electroactive interferents in the analyte. The second method was based on  the measurement of oxygen consumed during the enzyme-catalysed oxidation of  ascorbic acid using Clark Electrode.</p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Lactic Acid Biosensor</strong><br />
				  The level of lactic acid in blood is used in clinical  diagnostics of hypoxia, lactic acidosis, some acute heart diseases and drug  toxicity tests. Reliable blood lactate measurements would also be of interest  in sports medicine. Lactate can be measured based on the reaction using NAD+ dependent  lactate dehydrogenase and ferricyanide<strong>. </strong>The concentration of dissolved  L-lactate was determined in tomato paste and baby food samples using a  SIRE-based (sensors based on injection of the recognition element) biosensor.  The evaluation principle was based on the injection of small amount of enzyme  into an internal delivery flow system and held in direct spatial contact with  the amperometric transducer by the use of a semipermeable membrane. All the  measurements were based upon the reversible enzymatic conversion of L lactate to  pyruvate and hydrogen peroxide by lactate oxidase. The L-lactate concentrations  of the tomato paste and baby food were calculated to be 1.02 (0.02 mM) and 2.51  (0.10 mM), respectively, using the standard addition method. </p>
				<p><strong>Phenolic Compounds</strong><br />
				  Phenolic compounds are widespread in nature, and they  play a significant role in living organisms. They are used in medicine and  industries, including  wood processing  and pesticide production. Most of the phenolic derivative compounds are highly  toxic, and their determination in low concentrations is the significant  problem. Scientists are developing various procedures for determining phenols  with biosensors.<br />
				  A biosensor based on crude seed hull enzyme extracts  has been prepared for monitoring phenol and hydrogen peroxide. The biosensor  has confirmed very promising results as a successful instrument to monitor both  hydrogen peroxide and phenol. It is an inexpensive biosensor that could be operated  for up to 3 weeks with rapid response and stability parameters. In conditions  of response to phenol detection, the developed SBP biosensor was found less  sensitive than other previously reported biosensors based on purified SBP or  HRP or on crude extracts of sweet potato, which have detection limits in the  micromolar range for phenols. The foremost reason for this was the low activity  of the enzyme extracts. Further work on the improvement of biosensor  sensitivity and applications for the detection of chlorophenols and other  substituted phenols are in progress.<br />
				  The amperometric biosensor described glucose oxidase  and polyphenol oxidase carbon paste electrodes prepared via a new strategy of  carbon paste modification based on the in situ electropolymerizaton of pyrrole  monomer previously mixed within the paste. Such alteration induced a better  electrical percolation of the carbon structure and enhanced the enzyme  entrapment within the electrode material. Therefore, attractive potentialities  offered by a biocomposite electrode based on PPO for the detection of flavonols  have been demonstrated to control the phenolic levels in beer samples.</p>
				<p><strong>Benzoic Acid</strong><br />
				  An amperometric benzoic acid-sensing inhibitor biosensor  was prepared by immobilizing mushroom (<em>Agaricus bisporus</em>) tissue  homogenate on a Clarktype oxygen electrode. The effects of the quantity of  mushroom tissue homogenate, the quantity of gelatin and the effect of the  cross-linking agent glutaraldehyde percent on the biosensor were deliberated.  The most favourable concentration of phenol used as substrate was 200 mM. The  biosensor responded linearly to benzoic acid in a concentration range of 25–100  mM and Standard deviation (s.d.) was found to be ±0.49 μM for 7 successive  determinations at a concentration of 75 μM. The inhibitor<br />
				  biosensor based on mushroom tissue homogenate was  applied for the determination of benzoic acid in fizzy lemonade, some fruits  and groundwater samples. A good concord was shown when the results were  compared to those obtained using AOAC<br />
				  method.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Fructose</strong><br />
				  A superior amperometric biosensor based on a solid  binding matrix (SBM) composite transducer has been used for the determination  of d-fructose in various food samples. The enzyme, d-fructose dehydrogenase (EC  1.1.99.11), was incorporated directly into a solid composite transducer  containing both 2-hexadecanone as SBM and chemically modified graphite. The  current variation caused by the presence of d-fructose was calculated  amperometrically using Hexacyanoferrate (iii) as a redox mediator. The amperometric  signals generated were fast, reproducible and linearly proportional to  d-fructose concentrations in the range 50×10-6 – 10×10<strong>-3</strong>mol l-1, with a  correlation coefficient of 0.999. A set of measurements at +0.20 V <em>versus </em>SCE  for 2×10-3 mol l-1 D-fructose yielded a relative standard deviation for the  steady-state current of 2.11%. The biosensor selectivity against anionic  interferents such as Lascorbate was enhanced by the use of chemically modified  graphite by a mild oxidation step. The biosensor was found stable for 6 months  and the assay of D-fructose by this electrode was not affected by the presence  of sugars or other interferents commonly found in food samples.</p>
				<p><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL APPLICATIONS</strong><br />
                    <strong>Toxicity</strong><br />
				  In environmental pollution monitoring, it is becoming  a general opinion that chemical analysis by itself does not provide sufficient  information to assess the ecological risk of polluted waters and wastewaters.  In the European Union, along with more stringent demands for water treatment  (Council Directive 91/271/EEC), industrial and urban wastewater effluents shall  reach certain limits of nontoxicity before the effluent can be discharged into  the environment. Thus, much effort has been made during the last years to  develop and use different bioassays and biosensors for toxicity evaluation of  water samples. Whole organisms are used to measure the potential biological  impact (toxicity) of a water or soil sample. That is the case of the toxicity  assays Microtox® (Azure, Bucks, UK),  or ToxAlert® (Merck, Darmstadt,   Germany). These  systems are based on the use of luminescent bacteria, <em>Vibrio fischeri</em>,  to measure toxicity from environmental samples. Bacterial bioluminescence has  proved to be a convenient measure of cellular metabolism and, consequently, a  reliable sensor for measuring the presence of toxic chemicals in aquatic  samples. Some bioassay methods are integrated now in biosensors such as the Cellsense®,  which is an amperometric sensor that incorporates <em>Escherichia coli </em>bacterial  cells for rapid ecotoxicity analysis. It uses ferricyanine, a soluble electron  mediator, to divert electrons from the respiratory system of the immobilized  bacteria of a suitable carbon electrode. The resulting current is, thus, a  measure of bacterial respiratory activity, and the perturbation by pollutants  can be detected as a change in the magnitude of the current. Cellsense has been  applied to investigate the toxicity of 3,5-dichlorophenol and other phenols in  wastewater, for the determination of nonionic surfactants and benzene sulfonate  compounds, for the analysis of wastewater treatment works (WWTW) influent and  effluent, and for the toxicity testing of wastewaters and sewage sludge.  Moreover, Cellsense has been proposed as one of the newer rapid toxicity  assessment methods within the direct toxicity assessment (DTA) demonstration  program of the UK Environmental Agency. Most environmental biosensors have  focused on bacterial systems while eukariotic biosensors are rare; even more  rare is the use of mammalian cells. The mammalian cell, which is more complex  than bacteria, can give a more sensitive response when compared to bacteria  while also responding to the estrogenic effects of chemicals. A recombinant  fluorescent Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line, utilizing a fluorescent reporter  system, was used to monitor various toxicants, especially endocrine-disrupting compounds  (EDCs), in diverse aqueous environments. EDCs have been also analyzed with a  multichannel two-stage mini-bioreactor system using a genetically engineered  bioluminescent bacteria. The toxicity of various samples spiked with known  endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and phenol was investigated.</p>
				<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong><br />
				  Despite the huge potential of biosensors, and the  ever-increasing number of biosensors developed, commercially available  biosensors are being applied to a restricted area of the potential market. In  general, biosensors for environmental analysis have several limitations:  sensitivity, response time, and lifetime, which should be improved for them to  become a competitive analytical tool. The areas of development that are  expected to have an impact in biosensor technology are: immobilization  techniques, nanotechnology, miniaturization, and multisensor array  determinations. However, a crucial aspect may be the production of new sensing  elements easy to synthesize and with the capability to broaden the spectra of  selectivities that can be reached by a biosensor. At present, the preparation  and production in large scales of biomolecules such as enzymes or antibodies  need an investment of time and knowledge. Synthetic peptides and MIPs are  contemplated as promising alternatives overcoming the above-mentioned  limitations. Unfortunately, the affinity accomplished by these synthetic  receptors is still several orders of magnitude below that of the antibodies.  Improvement in the affinity, specificity, and mass production of the molecular  recognition components may ultimately dictate the success or failure of  detection technologies. The possibility of tailor binding molecules with  predefined properties, such as selectivity, affinity, and stability, is one of  the major aims for biotechnology. The development of advanced receptors will allow  the analysis of complex real samples and in situ measurements resolving the  responses from the analyte and from nonspecific background effects. Since  scientific attention is currently being given to biotechnology, as this review  has pointed out, the development of improved molecular recognition elements  will be followed by a corresponding enhancement of the biosensor features. From  the above viewpoint, it is clear that the future of biosensors will rely on the  success of emerging sophisticated micro and nanotechnologies, biochemistry,  chemistry, thin-film physics, and electronics. To reach this goal, an important  investment in research, expertise, and the necessary facilities is needed.  However, as the world becomes more concerned about the impact that  environmental contamination may cause on public health and the ecosystem, the  demand for rapid detecting biosensors will only increase. Biosensors still need  to achieve the confidence of potential users, having in mind that the  commercialization of new devices will always be the best indicator of the  success of a biosensor technology. The analysis of complex matrices and of  analytes difficult to determine by the actual analytical procedures (i.e.,  highly polar compounds), are progressively being approached by biosensors.  However, there is still a lack of alternative biosensing systems for an  important bunch of emerging contaminants such as bisphenol A, phtalates, and  polybrominated compounds (used as flame retardants), veterinary and human medicines  and personal care products (nutraceuticals, synthetic fragances, sun screen  agents, etc.)</p>
