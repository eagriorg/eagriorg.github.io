				<p>The energy  captured within ATP can then be harnessed to create order in the form of  biosynthetic reactions. In a hypothetical enzyme reaction that converts  substrates A−H and B−OH to A−B and H2 O, the energy from ATP hydrolysis is  first used to convert B−OH to a higher-energy intermediate, B−O−PO4. This compound is only transiently formed, with the energy  released during its decay used by the enzyme to form A−B. Thus, the energy released from the ATP  hydrolysis reaction (large −<em>_</em>G) is coupled  to the synthesis reaction (large +<em>_</em>G). In  this way, the cell can progressively create order.<strong> </strong><br />

				<ul>
				  <li>Although  cells could transfer electrons directly from NADH to oxygen, this would  liberate all energy in NADH directly as heat.</li>
				  <li>NADH  possesses lots of energy. If electrons are transferred directly to oxygen:</li>
				  <li>NADH  + O2  NAD + H2O,  delta Go' = - 218 kjoules/mole </li>
				  <li>If  NADH has ~218 kjoules of energy, and it only takes 30.5 kjoules to make one  ATP, could conceivably make 218/30.5 = ~ 7 ATP per NADH if energy conversion  were 100% efficient.</li>
				  <li>In  practice, cells have evolved ways to get up to 40% efficiency (~ 3 ATP/NADH)  under optimal circumstances.</li>
				  <li>Electron  transport system (ETS) = membrane-bound pathway transferring electrons from  organic molecules to oxygen.</li>
				  <li>ETS  moves both electrons and protons:electrons are passed from carrier to carrier  in the membrane, while protons are moved from inside to outside of membrane</li>
				  <li>Net  result: electrons enter ETS from carriers like NADH or FADH, wind up at  terminal oxidase, get attached to oxygen.</li>
				  <li>ETS  consists of 4 complexes, connected by mobile carriers (Coenzyme Q, cytochrome  c) that shuttle between complexes in membrane</li>

                    <strong>Specific carriers of ETS:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>mitochondria (in eukaryotes): NADH ---&gt; (Flavoprotein  Iron sulfur proteins  Quinone   cytochrome b  cytochrome c  cytochrome a   cytochrome a3  oxygen</li>
                  <li>bacteria (prokaryotes) have different ETS carriers, shorter  chains. In E. coli, can have  two different terminal oxidases, one functions at high oxygen levels, one at  lower oxygen levels. Cytochromes involved include: b558, b595,  b562, d, and o</li>
                  <li>proton gradient and oxidative phosphorylation  (oxphos)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><a href="http://biology-animations.blogspot.com/search/label/chemiosmosis"><strong>Chemiosmotic hypothesis (Peter Mitchell, 1961)</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>As  electrons flow through ETS, at certain steps protons (H+) are moved from inside  to outside of the membrane.</li>
                  <li>This  builds up proton gradient; since + charges are removed from inside of cell, -  charge remains inside, mainly as OH- ions.</li>
                  <li>pH  just outside membrane can reach 5.5, pH just inside membrane can reach 8.5  ---&gt; difference of 3 pH units, or 1000x concentration differential of H+  across membrane. This represents potential energy stored up in proton gradient  = proton motive force.</li>
                  <li>Membrane  is basically impermeable to protons, so gradient doesn't get squandered away by  leaky reentry.</li>
                  <li>ATP synthase protein complex contains only channels for proton  entry. As protons push in through channel, the base rotates. Specific binding  sites allow ADP + Pi  ATP.  This can be called chemiosmotic  phosphorylation (assuming chemiosmotic hypothesis is correct), or oxidative phosphorylation (makes no  assumption about mechanism.</li>
                </ul>

                    <strong>Differences  between respiration in mitochondria (eukaryotes) and bacteria (procaryotes)</strong></p>
                
                  <li><strong>In Eukaryotes:</strong><strong> </strong></li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>ETS  located in inner mitochondrial membrane. Proton gradient develops across inner  mitochondrial membrane.</li>
                    <li>Mitochondria  are very efficient at generating proton gradient. Can measure how many ~P bonds  (in ATP) are made for each O2 consumed = P/O ratio.</li>
                    <li>With  NADH as electron donor, P/O ratio can be 3 (means 3 ATP made per NADH).</li>
                    <li>But  with FADH as electron donor, P/O ration only 2 (fewer protons are transported,  less proton gradient).</li>
                    <li>Overall  efficiency of respiration in mitochondria: ~ 40% (means that about 40% of  energy in glucose actually gets converted to ATP).</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li><strong>In Prokaryotes:</strong><strong> </strong></li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>ETS  located in cytoplasmic membrane. Proton gradient develops across this membrane.</li>
                    <li>Bacteria  are not as efficient. ETS chains are shorter, P/O ratios are lower.</li>
                    <li>As  a ballpark estimate, P/O ratios for NADH are only ~2. Overall efficiency of  glucose oxidation is closer to 28%, not 40%.</li>
                  </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Inhibitors of Oxidative Phosphorylation</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Several  chemicals can block electron transfer in ETS, or transfer of electrons to  oxygen. All are strong poisons. Some examples:</li>
                  
                    <li>Carbon  monoxide -- combines directly with terminal cytochrome oxidase, blocks oxygen  attachment</li>
                    <li>Cyanide  (CN-) and Azide (N3-) bind to cytochrome iron  atoms, prevent electron transfer.</li>
                    <li>Antimycin  A (an antibiotic) inhibits electron transfer between cyt b and c.</li>
                  
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Anaerobic respiration</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Use  of acceptors other than oxygen.</li>
                  <li>Most  common in bacteria. Most alternative electron acceptors are inorganic  molecules, but some organic molecules can serve.</li>
                  <li>As  with aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration uses ETS, membrane  localization, proton gradient, and ATP synthase.</li>
                  <li>Processes  are of great importance both ecologically and industrially.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Anaerobic respiration</strong><br />
                  Nitrate (NO3-).</p>
               
                <ul>
                  <li>Process  called denitrification. Also  called dissimilative nitrate reduction. Reduced waste products are excreted in  significant amounts.</li>
                  <li>Redox  potential is + 0.42 v (compared to + 0.82 v for oxygen). So organisms respiring  anaerobically gain less energy than with oxygen.</li>
                  <li>Requires  new terminal oxidase called nitrate  reductase. Enzyme is repressed by oxygen, synthesis turned on in absence  of oxygen.</li>
                  <li>Process  can have several steps, proceed in two different directions:</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>(A)  nitrate (NO3-)   nitrite (NO2-) ammonia (NH3)</li>
                  <li>(B)  nitrate (NO3-) nitrite (NO2-)  nitrous oxide (N2O)  dinitrogen gas (N2) </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>Second  process is major pathway for loss of nitrogen compounds from soil, return of  nitrogen to atmosphere.</li>
                  <li>Pseudomonas species are common denitrifiers, widespread in  soils. When fertilized soils become flooded, oxygen is rapidly depleted,  pseudomonads switch to anaerobic respiration and can use up soil nitrate,  leaving field in unfertile state.</li>
                  <li>Note:  Studied this in lab. Media must contain nitrate in addition to nutrients,  otherwise won't work. Also, in scavenger hunt at end of course, one target  microbe will be Pseudomonas,  enrichment culture depends on its ability to grown anaerobically using nitrate  reduction.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Sulfate (SO42-)</strong><strong> </strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Process  called sulfate reduction.</li>
                    <li>Sulfate  (SO42-)  Hydrogen Sulfide  (H2S)</li>
                    <li>Small  group of bacteria carry out this reaction; all obligate anaerobes.</li>
                    <li>Have  unique cytochrome c3.</li>
                    <li>Sulfate  is common in sea water. Often, H2S combines with iron, forms  insoluble FeS  black sediments. Common in  estuaries.</li>

                  <ol>
                    <li>One  of most common inorganic ions.</li>
                    <li>Methanogens: most important group of CO2 reducers. Obligate anaerobes,  archaebacteria. Produce methane as waste product.</li>
                    <li>Reaction:  CO2 + H2 + H+   CH4 + H2O</li>
                    <li>Note:  reaction also requires Hydrogen gas. Methanogens typically live alongside  bacteria that produce hydrogen by fermentation, remove hydrogen as it is made.</li>

                  <li>Oxidation  of pyruvate (3-C) + NAD+   Acetyl-CoA (2-C) + CO2 + NADH</li>
                  <li>Carried  out by pyruvate dehydrogenase (multi-enzyme system)</li>
                  <li>Note:  Acetyl-CoA can also be produced by breakdown of lipids or certain amino acids  -- important focal point of central metabolism</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Net effects of TCA cycle: </strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>To start cycle:</strong></li>
                  <li>Acetyl-CoA  (2-C) + oxaloacetate (4-C)  citric acid  (6-C)</li>
                  <li><strong>Subsequent steps:</strong></li>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Convert  citrate to isocitrate (still 6-C) </li>
                    <li>Oxidize  alpha-ketoglutarate (5-C) + CO2 +  NADH </li>
                    <li>Oxidize  succinyl-CoA (4-C) + CO2 + NADH </li>
                    <li>SLP  reaction: succinyl-CoA (4-C) + GDP   succinate (4-C) + GTP (Note: GTP can be interconverted with ADP to form  ATP) </li>
                    <li>Oxidize  fumarate (4-C) + FADH2 -- convert  fumarate to malate</li>
                    <li>(6)oxidize  again  oxaloacetate (4-C) + NADH</li>
                  </ol>
                  <li>Net  yield: Acetyl-CoA (2-C) + 3 NAD+ + FAD  2 CO2 + 3 NADH + FADH2 + ATP</li>
                  <li>TCA  cycle completes the oxidation of carbons in pyruvate to most oxidized form (CO2);  removes electrons originally in C-H bonds to electron carriers NADH and FADH  for use in respiration machinery.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Catabolism  of substances other than glucose: </strong>Many  other possible C-sources for catabolism beside glucose. In general, must  convert these into molecules that can enter into central metabolism, either in  glycolysis or TCA cycle.</p>

                    <li><strong>carbohydrates</strong><strong> </strong></li>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Most  abundant C-sources in most environments, most in various polysaccharides  (cellulose, starch, lignin, etc.)</li>
                      <li>To  gain access to sugars, must first secrete hydrolytic enzymes that break down  glycosidic bonds in polysaccharides, produce mono- and disaccharides that can  be transported into cells.</li>
                      <li>Starch, glycogen -- easily hydrolyzed by amylases</li>
                      <li>Cellulose -- difficult to digest, very insoluble, tightly folded. Many fungi,  some bacteria produce cellulases.</li>
                      <li>Agar  -- some marine bacteria produce agars</li>
                      <li>Once  mono- or disaccharides are available, they are transported into cell, converted  into some typical glycolytic intermediate such as glucose-6-phosphate, catabolized by glycolytic  enzymes. </li>

                      <li>Biological  lipids common as triglycerides, diglycerides.</li>
                      <li>To  catabolize, bacteria secrete lipases, hydrolyze glycerides to free fatty acids  and glycerol.</li>
                      <li>Fatty  acids attacked by Beta-oxidation pathway.</li>
                      <li>Using  FAD and NAD+ to remove electrons, 2-C units are removed as  Acetyl-CoA, feed directly into central metabolism at TCA cycle entry.  Glycolysis pathway not involved (except for use in synthesizing sugars needed  for cell wall, running sections of pathway in reverse).</li>

                    <li><strong>proteins</strong><strong> </strong></li>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Proteins  must first be hydrolyzed by protease enzymes, to get individual amino acids  which can be transported into cells.</li>
                      <li>Amino  acids all have common structure: NH2 - RCH - COOH.</li>
                      <li>1st  step in catabolism is to remove amino group (deamination), often by swapping it  with another substrate (transamination).</li>
                      <li>Typical  example: glutamic acid (an AA) + pyruvate   alpha-ketoglutarate + alanine (= pyruvate + amino group). Now alpha-KG  can be oxidized in TCA cycle, since it is a TCA cycle compound.</li>
                      <li>As  excess amino groups accumulate, must be secreted as waste products, possibly as  ammonium ion (leads to alkaline pH).</li>
