				<p><strong>MICROBIAL  TRANSFORMATIONS OF NITROGEN</strong><br />
               Biological availability  of N, P and K is of considerable economic importance, since they are the major  plant nutrients derived from the soil. Of the three, N stands out as the most  susceptible one to microbial transformations.   This element is the key building block of the protein molecule upon  which all life is based on, it is an indispensable component of the protoplasm  of plants, animals and micro organism.<br />
              Molecular N2  constitutes about 78% of the earth’s atmosphere but it is chemically inert and  cannot be utilized by more living organism, plant animals and micro organism  therefore depend on a source of combined N such as ammonia, nitrate or organic  N compounds for their growth.<br />
              Nitrogen undergoes a number of  transformations that involve organic, inorganic and volatile forms of  nitrogen.  A small part of the large  reservoir of N2 in the atmosphere is converted to organic compounds  by certain free living micro organism or by plant microbe association that  makes the element available to plant growth. The nitrogen present in the  proteins or nucleic acids of plant tissue is used by animals.  In the animal body, the N is converted to  other simple and complex compounds.  Upon  the death, plants and animals undergo microbial decay and organic N is released  as ammonium, which is then utilized by vegetation or is oxidized to nitrate by  microorganisms.  The nitrate from of N is  mostly used by the plants or may be lost by bacteria reduced to gaseous N2,  which escapes to atmosphere, there by completing the cycle. The Nitrogen cycle  mainly includes transformations such as </p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Nitrogen       mineralization : In which N containing organic complexes are decomposed       and converted into inorganic compounds for use by plants</li>
				  <li>N immobilization :       In which N containing inorganic compounds are assimilated</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>          N2 is acted on by certain micro organism  sometimes in symbiosis with a higher plant, which can use it is as a N source  for growth.  The process of nitrogen  fixation, results in the accumulation of new organic compounds in the cells of  responsible micro organisms.  The N2  thus fixed reenters general circulation when the newly formed cells are inturn  mineralized. <br />
				  By means of these reactions the subterranean microflora  regulates the supply and governs the availability and chemical nature of N in  soil. <br />

				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>I. Nitrogen mineralization</strong><br />
				  The conversion of organic N to the more mobile, inorganic  state is known as nitrogen mineralization. As a consequence of mineralization,  ammonium and nitrate are generated and organic N disappears.  This takes place in two distinct  microbiological steps. <br />
  <strong>1. Ammonification</strong><br />
				  It is the process of mineralization in which proteins,  nucleic acids and other organic components are degraded by micro organism with  the eventual liberation of ammonia. This is called ammonification. A part of  the liberated ammonia is assimilated by the micro organism themselves.  The first step in ammonication process is the  hydrolysis of proteins, nucleic acids and other organic nitrogenous compounds  into amino acids (proteolysis). The amino compounds are then deaminated to  yield ammonia.  Ammonification usually  occurs under aerobic conditions while under anerobic conditions protein  decomposition leads to conversion of ammonia into amines and related compounds  (eg) clostridium. The anaerobic decomposition of protein called as putrefaction.  These amines are subsequently oxidized in the  presence of O2 to release ammonia. <br />
				  Break down of nitrogenous substance is brought about by the  activity of a multitude of microbial species.<br />
				  Almost all bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi can bring  about proteolysis and the amino acids produced are utilized for the growth of  these organisms. <br />
  <strong>(2) Nitrification</strong><br />
				  The biological oxidation of ammonium salts (in soil) to  nitrites and the subsequent oxidation of nitrites to nitrates is called as  nitrification. i.e. the biological convention of N in soil from a reduced to a  more oxidized state, called nitrification. <br />
				  Nitrification occurs in two steps;<br />
				  First ammonia  is oxidized to nitrite.<br />
				  2 NH3 + 1½   H2O2  → NO2- + 2H+H2O-Nitrosofication<br />
				  This change  is brought about by chemoautotrophic bacteria of the genera <em>Nitrosomonas</em>, <em>Nitrosolobus, Nitrosococus, Nitrosospira</em>.  These bacteria obtain their energy  requirement by the oxidation of NH4+ to NO-2.  Among the nitrifiers <em>Nitrosomonas</em> are most important in soils.<br />
  <strong>Some heteotrophs involved</strong><br />
  <em>          Streptomyces, Nocardia</em><br />
  <strong>Second step</strong><br />
				  Nitrite is  further oxidized to nitrate <br />
				  HNO2  + ½ O2 → HNO3.<br />
  <strong>Organisms:</strong> <em>Nitrobacter</em>, <em>Aspergillus</em>, <em>Penicillium</em>, <em>Cephalosporium</em>.<br />
  <strong>Factors influencing the growth of nitrifying bacteria in soil</strong><br />
				  Levels of ammonia and nitrite, aeration, moisture,  temperature, pH and organic matter. In acid soils – nitrification is poor.  Waterlogged soils – deficient in O2 – not congenial for nitrification.  <br />
  <strong>3. Denitrification</strong><br />
				  The convention of nitrate and nitrite into molecular N2  or nitrous oxide through microbial processes is known as denitrification.  Certain bacteria are capable of using nitrate  as the terminal electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions.  This is called <strong>nitrate respiration</strong>. As a consequence of nitrate respiration, NO3  is reduced to N2 gas or nitrous oxide.  Denitirifcation leads to the loss of N from  the soil. It depletes N, and therefore it is not a desirable reaction. <br />
				  The escape of molecular N into the atmosphere is also known  as <strong>volatalization</strong>.<br />
				  Denitirfication occur mostly in waterlogged anaerobic soils  with a high organic matter contents.   Denitrification of bound nitrogen to gaseous N is mediated by numerous  species of bacteria, which normally use O2 as hydrogen acceptor  (aerobically) and, also use nitrates and nitrites (anerobically).<br />
				  Anaerbic convertion of nitrate into molecular nitrogen is  known as nitrate respiration. <br />
  <strong>Bacterial  genera which bring about denitirfication <em>Pseudomonas,  Achromobacter, Bacillus, Micrococcus</em></strong><br />
				  2NO-3 +10 H →  N2 + 4H2O+ 2OH- (or)<br />
				  2NO-2  +6 H → N2 +2H2O +2OH- (or)<br />
				  N2O + 2H → N2 + H2O<br />
				  Since nitrates are used as a source of electron acceptor,  there is a net loss of N from soil.  This  process is termed also as <strong>dissimilatory  nitrate reduction</strong>. Many soil bacteria like.<br />
  <strong><em>Thiobacillus  denitrificans</em></strong><strong> </strong><br />
				  Oxidize S (chemoautotrophically) and also reduce nitrate to  nitrogen <br />
				  5S + 6 KNO3 + 2 H2O →  3N2 + K2SO4 + 4KHSO4 (or)<br />
				  5 K2S2O3  + 8 KNO3 + H2O → 4N2  + 9 K2SO4 + H2SO4­<br />
  <strong>General pathway of denitrification</strong> <br />
				  Nitrate is first reduced to nitrite, which is then  transformed to nitrous oxide (NO).  The  nitrous oxide is converted to N2 with N2O as an  intermediate.<br />
				  1                2               3              4<br />
				  2 HNO3 →    2HNO2 →    2 NO   →    N2O   →   N2<br />
  <strong>The enzymes involved </strong><br />
				  1. Nitrate reductase                           3. Nitric oxide reductase<br />
				  2. Nitrite reductase                            4. Nitrous oxide  reductase</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Fallow  soils flooded with water are more congenial for denitrification than well  drained and continuously cropped soils.</li>
				  <li>Though  it is a undesirable reaction in point of view of plant nutrition, but have  ecological importance. Because with out denitrification the supply of N on the  earth world have got depleted and NO3 would have accumulated.</li>
				  <li>High  concentration of NO3 are toxic, denitrification is a mechanism by  which some of the N is released back to the atmosphere. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>5. Nitrate reduction</strong><br />
				  The reverse of nitrification process.  That is the reduction of nitrate to nitrite  and then ammonia. Since organisms are able to obtain cellular Nth ammonia  assimilation, the process is called as assimilatory nitrate reduction.   <br />
				  HNO3 + 4H2 → NH3 + 3H2O<br />
  <strong>II.  Nitrogen immobilization</strong><strong> </strong><br />
  <strong>          </strong>The process of microbial  assimilation of inorganic nitrogen is referred as immobilization. In contrast  to mineralization, microbial immobilization leads to the biosynthesis of the  complex molecules of microbial protoplasm from ammonium and nitrate.  Immobilization results in a marked depression  of nitrogen uptake by the plant.  <br />
				  The mineralization of organic N and the microbial  assimilation of inorganic ions proceeds simultaneously.Both mineralization and  immobilization take place regardless of the % of N in the organic N in organic  matter. On the death of micro organism, the immobilized N is however released  through mineralization.  It is also a  loss of nitrogen. NO3 when accumulated in microbial protoplasm it is  referred as assimilatory NO3 reduction. <br />
  <strong>MICROBIAL  TRANSFORMATION OF PHOSPHORUS AND SULPHUR</strong><br />
  <strong>I. </strong><a href="http://www.sumanasinc.com/webcontent/animations/content/phosphorouscycle.html"><strong>Phosphorus  cycle (Video)</strong></a><strong> </strong><br />
				  Phosphorus is only second to N2  as an inorganic nutrient required by both plants and micro organisms. Phosphate  constitutes nearly 0.1% of the earth’s crust.   They occur in soil in inorganic and organic forms.<br />
				  The inorganic forms are derived from  parent rocks or through fertilizers application and manuring with bone  meal.  They are soluble in water when  present as phosphates of Na, K, Ca, Mg etc.<br />
				  The organic phosphorus containing  compounds are derived from plants and micro organisms and are composed of  nucleic acids, phospholipids, lecittin, phytin and related compounds.</p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Phosphorus in phytin,       phospholipids and nucleic acids is found as phosphates</li>
				  <li>Phytin is the calcium –       magnesium salt of phytic acid</li>
				  <li>Phospholipids are compounds in       which phosphate is combined with a lipid, contained 10% of cell       phosphorus.</li>
				  <li>Inorganic polyphosphates are       quite abundant in certain fungi</li>
				  <li>In soil, from15-85% of the       total P is organic. Soils rich in organic matter contain abundant organic       P.</li>
				  <li>Ratios of organic C to P of 100       to 300:1 N: organic P = 5 to 20: 1</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>          In cultivated soil P present in  abundant about 1100 kg/ha but most of them as not available to plants; only  about 1% of the total P is in available form.<br />
                    <img width="282" height="28" src="lec17_clip_image006.gif" align="left" hspace="12" alt="Description: Picture1.png" />PO43-  in rocks and in cells </p>

			    </ul>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Microorganisms  bring about a number of transformations of the element. </p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Altering the solubility of       inorganic compounds of P</li>
				  <li>Mineralization of organic       compounds with the release of inorganic phosphate</li>
				  <li>Converting the inorganic, available       anion into cell components, an immobilization process (analogous to that       occurring with N)</li>
				  <li>Bringing about  an oxidation or reduction of inorganic P       compounds</li>
			    </ol>
				<p>          Particularly, important to P cycle are  the microbial mineralization and immobilization reactions. <br />
                    <strong>(1)  Solubilization of inorganic phosphorus </strong><br />
				  Insoluble inorganic compounds of P are  largely unavailable to plants, but many micro organisms can bring the PO4  into solution.  P solubilizing are 105  to 107 / g soil.<br />
				  Eg: <em>Pseudomonas striata</em>, Microoccus <em>Bacillus sp</em>., Fusarium, <em>pergillus</em> sp, Solubilises calcium salts,  iron, aluminum, magnesium manganese phosphate. </p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>P is solubilized by the       production of organic acids. The acids convert Ca3 (PO4)2       to di and monobasic phosphates and releases P to plants.</li>
				  <li>Solubilization of phosphates by       plant roots &amp; micro organism is dependent on soil pH. In neutrals and       alkaline soils having a content of calcium, precipitation of CaPO4       takes place. Micro organism and plant root readily dissolve such PO4       and make them available to plants.</li>
				  <li>On contrary, acid soils are       generally poor in Ca ions and phosphates and precipitated in the form of       ferric or aluminum compounds which are not soluble.  There, it is solubilized by the addition       of PO4 solublizing micro organism. </li>
				  <li>Phosphorus exists mainly as       apatides, with the basic formula M10 (PO4)6       X2.  Commonly the mineral       (M) is Ca, less often Al or Fe.  The       anion (X) is either F- or Cl- or OH- or       CO2-3.        Diverse combinations of M and X results in 200 forms of P.</li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong> (2) Mineralization of organic phosphorus</strong><br />
				  Organic form of P is the larger  reservoir of P in soil.  By the action of  bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes, bound element in remains of the vegetation  and in soil organic matter is made available to succeeding generations of plants.<br />
				  Among the organic phosphours  compounds, lecithin, nucleic acids and phytin occupy a prominent place.  Lecithin contains 9.39 % P2O5,  1.6% N and 65.36% C.<br />
				  It is a process of convention of  organic forms of phosphorus into inorganic available forms of P a highly  significant correlation is observed between the rates of N and P convention to  inorganic forms.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Mineralization  is favoured by warm temperature, with the thermophilic range being more  favourable than mesophilic range.</li>
				  <li>Neutral  pH increases PO4 release, which favours microbial metabolism</li>
				  <li>Quantity  of substrate ie presence of organic P. If more P, more of mineralization</li>
				  <li>Mineralization  is mediated by the enzymes called phosphatases.   These enzymes cleave phosphorus from more frequently encountered organic  substrates.</li>
				  <li>Phytases  liberates PO4 from phytic acid or its Ca-Mg, Salt, Phytin.  They remove PO4-s, one at a time,  yield penta – tetra, di- and mono PO4 and then finally free  inositol.</li>
				  <li><em>Bacillus, Pseudomonas,  Aspergillus, Penicillium, Rhizopus </em>can synthesize this enzyme.  Mycorrhizal (fungi) are also able to mineralize the organic forms of P and  increases P uptake by the plants. </li>
			    </ul>
				<p><strong>(3)  Immobilization </strong><br />
				  Process of assimilation of P into  microbial nucleic acids, phospholipids or other protoplasmic substances is  called immobilization.  It leads to the  accumulation of non utilizable forms of the element.<br />
				  P accounts for 0.5-1.0% of fungus  mycelium and 1.0 to 3.0% of the dry weight of the bacteria and actinomycetes. <br />
  <strong>(4)  Oxidation reduction reactions</strong><br />
				  Biological oxidation of reduced  phosphorus compounds into oxidized state.<br />
				  Phosphite (HPO3=)  is oxidized to phosphate.  A number of  hetertrophic (bacteria), (fungi) &amp; (actinomycetes) utilize phosphite as  sole P source. Hypophosphites (HPO2=) can also be  oxidized to phosphate by heterotrophs. <br />
				  HPO3= → HPO4=<br />
				  HPO2= → HPO4=<br />
				  <strong>Reductive  process</strong>, reductive pathway has also been functioned. PO4 is  reduced to phosphite and hypophosphite.<br />
				  H3PO4  →  H3PO3 → H3PO2<br />
				  <em>Clostridium  butyricum</em>, <em>E. coli</em> form phosphite  and hypophosphite from orthophosphate.   It is biochemically analogue to the process of denitirification.  Only little information is available about  this process.          <br />
				  P exist in an organic form in the  protoplasm on the death of living organism, this (P) is changed to inorganic  phosphoric acid.  This is soon converted  into insoluble salts of Ca, Fe, Mg and Al.   Phosphorus thus alternates between organic and inorganic, and soluble  and insoluble forms.  In soluble P is  solubilized by various acids produced by micro organism. <br />
				  Microbial activities involved in the  cycling of C, N and P are absolutely essential for maintenance of soil  fertility. <br />
  <strong>II. Sulphur  cycle </strong><br />
				  Sulphur like N, is an essential  element for all living systems because of it’s inert nature, is not utilized by  plants. To be used first S has to to be oxidized or reduced. In soil, it occurs  both organic (S containing amino acids, vitamins ) as well as inorganic forms  (Sulphur, sulphates etc., ) .<br />
				  Four  distinct transformations are recognized </p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li><strong>Decomposition/Mineralization </strong> of larger organic S compounds to smaller       units and their conversion into inorganic compounds </li>
				  <li>Microbial associated <strong>immobilization</strong></li>
				  <li><strong>Oxidation       of inorganic ions and compounds</strong> such as       sulphides,thiosulphates, Sulphu </li>
				  <li><strong>Reduction </strong>of Sulphates       abd other sulphides  </li>
