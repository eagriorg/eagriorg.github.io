				<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
				  Bacteria are mostly  unicellular organisms that lack <a href="http://science.jrank.org/pages/1447/Chlorophyll.html">chlorophyll</a> and are among the smallest living things on  earth—only viruses are smaller. Multiplying rapidly under favorable conditions,  bacteria can aggregate into colonies of millions or even billions of organisms  within a <a href="http://science.jrank.org/pages/6316/Space.html">space</a> as small as a drop of <a href="http://science.jrank.org/pages/7301/Water.html">water</a>.The Dutch merchant and amateur scientist Anton  van Leeuwenhoek was the first to observe bacteria and other <a href="http://science.jrank.org/pages/4305/Microorganisms.html">microorganisms</a>. Using single-lens microscopes of his own  design, he described bacteria and other microorganisms (calling them  &quot;animacules&quot;) in a series of letters to the Royal Society of London  between 1674 and 1723.<br />
				  Bacteria are classified as  prokaryotes. Broadly, this taxonomic ranking reflects the fact that the genetic  material of bacteria is contained in a single, circular chain of <a href="http://science.jrank.org/pages/2007/Deoxyribonucleic-Acid-DNA.html">deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)</a> that is not enclosed within a nuclear <a href="http://science.jrank.org/pages/4199/Membrane.html">membrane</a>. The word <a href="http://science.jrank.org/pages/5513/Prokaryote.html">prokaryote</a> is derived from Greek meaning  &quot;prenucleus.&quot; Moreover, the DNA of prokaryotes is not associated with  the special chromosome proteins called histones, which are found in higher  organisms. In addition, prokaryotic cells lack other membrane-bounded  organelles, such as mitochondria. Prokaryotes belong to the kingdom Monera.  Some scientists have proposed splitting this designation into the kingdoms <a href="http://science.jrank.org/pages/2590/Eubacteria.html">Eubacteria</a> and <a href="http://science.jrank.org/pages/476/Archaebacteria.html">Archaebacteria</a>. Eubacteria, or true bacteria, consist of more  common <a href="http://science.jrank.org/pages/6353/Species.html">species</a>, while Archaebacteria (with the prefix  archae—meaning ancient) represent strange bacteria that inhabit very hostile  environments. Scientists believe these bacteria are most closely related to the  bacteria which lived when the <a href="http://science.jrank.org/pages/2214/Earth.html">earth</a> was very young. Examples of archaebacteria are  those bacteria which currently live in extremely salty environments or  extremely hot environments, like geothermal vents of the <a href="http://science.jrank.org/pages/4828/Ocean.html">ocean</a> floor<br />
				  Microbes are organisms that  we need a microscope to see. The lower limit of our eye's resolution is about  0.1 to 0.2 mm or 100 - 200 um. Most microbes range in size from about 0.2 um to  the 200 um upper limit, although some fruiting bodies of fungi can become much  larger. Microbes include the bacteria, algae, fungi, and protozoa. In this  lecture we will discuss mostly the bacteria and the fungi.<br />
				  Bacteria are found everywhere  in water, soil, and even air. These small prokaryotic cells, typically from 0.2  to 1 um in length, are capable of living in boiling water, frozen ground, acid  volcanoes, and at the bottom of the ocean. They can reproduce by doubling with  a generation time of 20 minutes, or survive for centuries in a resting stage.  In natural waters (lakes, streams, oceans) their generation time is around 1  day. In soils they live in a film of water around plant roots or other  particles, and their activity is dependent on the temperature and the amount of  available moisture. In general, bacteria are found in concentrations of 106  cells/mL of water in surface waters, and 109 cells/mL of soil in soils and  sediments.</p>
				<p><strong>Robert Koch (1843  -1910): The Father of Microbial Techniques</strong><strong> </strong><br />
				  Robert Koch, a German Physician, is well  known to the world of microbiology for this significant contributions  especially in the area of microbial techniques. He introduced analine dyes for  staining bacteria; used agar-agar and gelatin to prepare solid culture media;  stressed the need for pure culture to study microbes in details; confirmed germ  theory of disease, and laid down Koch's postulates to test the pathogenesity of  causative agents. He also discovered the casual organisms of anthrax disease of  cattle (<em>Bacillus anthracis</em>) and  tuberculosis (<em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>).<br />
                  <img width="267" height="251" src="lec02_clip_image002_0000.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" /> </p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
			    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
			    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
			    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
			    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
			    <p>Robert Koch was particularly concerned with  this problem and, at first, he cultured bacteria on solid fruits and vegetables  such as slices of boiled potato but many bacteria did not grow on such  substrates.&nbsp; Then he perceived that it would be far better if a well-tried  liquid medium could be solidified with some clear substance.&nbsp; Koch (1881)  tried gelatin as a solidifying agent and succeeded in developing solid culture  media, but gelatin, the first solidifying agent used, had serious disadvantage  of becoming liquid above 28-30°C which is below the optimum temperature for the  growth of human disease producing bacteria.<br />
			      However, Koch replaced gelatin by agar in  1883-84 on the recommendation of F.E. Hesse, a German housewife, who had gained  experience with the characteristics of agar in the process of making jelly.  Agar is still frequently used as solidifying agent in microbiological  laboratories. The development of solid culture media to grow pure culture was  of fundamental importance and may be considered one of the Koch's greatest  contributions.<br />
			      Besides  developing solid culture media using gelatin and agar, Koch also evolved  methods to placed microbes on glass slides and colour them with analine dyes  (stains) so that the individual cells could be seen more clearly under the  microscope.</p>
			    <p><strong>KOCH’S POSTULATES</strong><br />
			      1. The microorganism must be present in every  case of the disease but absent from healthy organisms.<br />
			      2. The suspected microorganism must be  isolated and grown in a pure culture.<br />
			      3. The same disease must result when the isolated  microorganism is inoculated into a healthy host.<br />
			      4. The same microorganism must be isolated  again from the diseased host.</p>
			    <p><strong>&quot;One microbe,  one disease&quot;</strong><strong> </strong></p>
			  
			    <ul>
			      <li>Robert Koch (1843-1910) was the  first to rigorously demonstrate that a specific disease was caused by a  specific microorganism.</li>
			      <li>Koch  worked on anthrax, a disease mainly of animals. Koch noticed that cattle that  died of anthrax all seemed to have a certain rod-shaped bacterium in blood, not  found in healthy animals. Koch was able to isolate the bacterium in pure  culture, put it back into healthy cows, and reproduce the disease.</li>
			      <li>Koch's Postulates:  a logical way to identify the microbe causing a disease</li>
		        </ul>
			    <ol>
			      <li>A specific microbe must be  present in all disease cases</li>
			      <li>Microbe must be cultivated  outside host in a pure culture</li>
			      <li>When pure culture of microbe  is inoculated into healthy hosts, disease symptoms identical to those of  initial host must be reproduced</li>
			      <li>Microbe can be isolated  again in pure culture from this experimentally inoculated host.</li>
		        </ol>
			    <ul>
			      <li>Initial  attempts to isolate microbes used sliced potatoes or nutrient media containing  gelatin -- not ideal media. Then Fannie Hesse (wife of lab worker) suggested agar, a gelling agent used in cooking.  Agar rapidly became the standard gelling agent for microbial isolation because  it is relatively inert (only some marine microbes have enzymes to digest agar).  Agar only melts at high temperatures (100oC); once melted, it  remains liquid until about 45oC, at which point it gels. </li>
			      <li>Koch's  success at identifying anthrax with bacterium Bacillus anthracis led both Koch  and Pasteur to identify the causes of many diseases -- cholera, tuberculosis,  plague, etc. -- over the next few decades (late 1880's) -- the &quot;Golden Age of Microbiology&quot; (~  1870-1920). Note that many microbiologists would regard the present as a new  &quot;Golden Age&quot;, since the development of molecular biological  techniques, PCR, molecular phylogeny, and other developments have revealed many  new insights and opened a world of new research directions and ways of understanding  microbes.</li>
