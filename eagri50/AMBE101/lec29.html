				<p align="right"><img src="images/back.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="30" usemap="#Map" />
                  <map name="Map" id="Map2">

				<p>Plant - Microbe symbioses<br />
				  1.	Many microbes (bacteria, fungi) have important symbioses with plants<br />
				  2.	Rhizosphere = thin layer of soil immediately attached to root hairs of plants. Typically contains 109 microbes/g of soil.<br />
				  3.	Many rhizosphere organisms are ectosymbionts, living outside the roots. Others are endosymbionts, living inside or penetrating into plant roots.<br />
				  4.	Many of these bacteria contribute Nitrogen fixation, obtain plant nutrients in return (see below for Rhizobium symbiosis).<br />
				  Rhizobium-Legume symbioses<br />
				  5.	Plants of the legume family (soybeans, clover, alfalfa, beans, peas) can grow in soils lacking nitrogen compounds required by other plants. How?<br />
				  6.	These plants contain endosymbiotic Rhizobium bacteria that grow in root nodules. Rhizobia can fix atmospheric Nitrogen gas (N2) N2 + 6[H]  2 NH3 <br />
			    7.	The reaction requires total lack of oxygen and lots of energy as ATP. To bind oxygen and get rid of it, bacteria use protein called leghemoglobin, somewhat similar to animal hemoglobin. Globin part is encoded in plant genome, heme group is encoded in bacterial genome. Neither partner can fix nitrogen alone, only in symbiosis.</p>

				<p><strong>Hydrothermal  vent Communities</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <ol>
				    <li>Occurs  only near thermal springs on ocean floor, 2 miles or more below surface.  Totally black, no sunlight penetrates below 600 feet.</li>
				    <li>Associated  with spreading centers of tectonic plates where hot magma close to surface  causes area of floor to slowly drift apart.</li>
				    <li>Seawater  seeps down, mixes w/ minerals at high temperature comes back to ocean water in  plumes at 270-380 deg. C. These are sometimes called black smokers since minerals precipitate as black cloud when in  contact with cold sea water .</li>
				    <li>Contains  high levels of inorganics: Mn2+, H2, usually H2S;  very low in organic matter</li>
				    <li>Astonishing discovery: such regions are densely populated by a community  of unusual animals: 2 m long tube worms, giant clams, mussels, white shrimp.</li>
				    <li>What  do they eat? Unlike earth's surface, there is no source of light to stimulate  phototrophs, they &quot;eat&quot; chemolithotrophic  bacteria!</li>
				    <li>Example: Inside the tube worms  live huge colonies of bacterial endosymbionts.  These are autotrophic chemolithotrophs,  oxidizing sulfide to sulfate as their energy source. As bacteria grow, they  provide carbon and nitrogen compounds for worms to feed on. Have not been  cultivated outside of host, so little is known about details of the bacterium.</li>
			      </ol>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Ruminant  Symbiosis</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <ol>
				    <li>Ruminants  are the herbivorous mammals whose digestive tract contains four chambers. First  chamber (largest) is the rumen, provides a place for bacteria to break down the  fiber in the plants so the cow can use it for energy.Ý</li>
				    <li>Includes  cows, sheep, giraffes, buffalo, and elk.</li>
				    <li>Ruminants  eat grasses and other plant materials, but do not produce enzymes to digest  cellulose, the primary plant metabolite.</li>
				    <li>Instead,  ruminants rely on huge microbial community in rumen to digest plant materials.  Microbial densities can reach as high as 1012 microorganisms/ml, the  highest density found anywhere in nature.</li>
				    <li>Ruminants  feed off fermentation waste products of microorganisms; mainly acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric  acid.</li>
			      </ol>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>Gnotobiotic  Animals</strong></p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Gnotobiotic = &quot;known microbiota&quot;; animal host is either entirely free of  microbes (aka &quot;germfree&quot;, &quot;axenic&quot;) or has a microbiota  whose identity is completely known.</li>
				  <li>Animals  in utero are germfree, but  acquire resident bacteria within hours of birth.</li>
				  <li>Relatively  easy to produce germfree animals for birds. Sterilize shell, use sterile  incubator, keep animals in an environment where all air, food, water is  sterilized before entry.</li>
				  <li>More  difficult to establish germfree animals other than birds. Need cesarean section  of pgrenant females, germfree isolation chambers where all air, food, water is  sterilized before entry.</li>
				  <li>Germfree  animals generally are less healthy than animals with normal microbiota. Defects  include:</li>
				  <ol>
				    <li>Greater  vitamin requirements for K and B complex</li>
				    <li>lower  cardiac output</li>
				    <li>much  more susceptible to pathogens -- normal microbiota colonize access sites, often  compete successfully to prevent pathogens from binding to host tissues.much  smaller infectious dose required to initiate an infection</li>
			      </ol>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p>Interrelationship  between microorganisms: Beneficial and harmful relationships<br />
				  Interrelationships in soils are of 3  types</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Plant  microbe interaction</li>
				  <li> Microbe – microbe interaction and</li>
				  <li>Plant  microbe – microbe interaction </li>
			    </ol>
				<p><strong>a) Plant  microbe interaction</strong><br />
				  It mainly constitutes the association  of microorganism with plants little in a positive way or in a negative way. The  positive approach is mainly the symbiotic relationships and the negative  approach constituents mainly pathogen plant interactions. <br />
  <strong>b) Plant  microbe – microbe interaction</strong><br />
				  Also called tripartite symbiosis<br />
				  Eg:     Alnus  – Frankia –Mycorrhiza and Casbarina – Frankia – Mycorrhiza<br />
  <em>Ceanothus</em> roots, with <em>Frankia</em> vesicles</p>
				<p><img src="6546498" /></p>
				<p><strong>c)  Microbe – microbe interaction</strong><br />
          Microbial interaction in  soil <br />
<strong>Interrelationship  between microorganisms: Beneficial and harmful relationship</strong><br />
          Microorganisms live in the soil, not  in the form of pure culture, but as complex populations.  Each particle of soil contains more than one  type of organisms.  So, microbial ecosystem  of soil is the sum of the biotic and the abiotic components of soil.  Many of these organisms depend upon one  another for direct and indirect nutrients.   Some complete with one another for energy sources and for the elements  and components used as nutrients.  This  results in the formation of numerous associations among the soil micro  organic.  The composition of the  microflora of any habitat is governed by the biological equilibrium created by  the associations and interactions of all individual found in the community.    <br />
The micro  organic that inhabits the soil exhibited many different types of associations  or interactions.  Some of the  associations are indifferent or neutral, some are beneficial type of  interactions and others are detrimental or negative.<br />
<strong>Beneficial /  positive interactions</strong><br />
a.  neutralism<br />
b. Symbiosis  / mutualism<br />
c.  Protoco-operation<br />
d.  Communalism <br />
<strong>a) Neutralism</strong><br />
          It is a type of neutral association,  in two microorganisms behaves entirely independently or eg: Each could utilize  different nutrients with out producing metabolic end products that are  inhibitory. This might be transitory as the condition change in the environment,  parituclary the availability of nutrients, the relationship might change. <br />
<strong>Symbiosis /  Mutualism</strong><br />
          <em>Mutualism</em> is a form of symbiosis in which both organisms  benefit. An example of mutualism is <em>a clownfish and sea anemones</em>. The  clownfish gets protection, while the sea anemones become clean. This is  mutualism, because both water animals benefit from having each other around</p>
				<p><img src="99865" /><img src="52165" /></p>
				<p><strong>b) Proto  co-operation</strong><br />
          One type of mutualistic association is  that involving the exchange of nutrients between two species, a phenomenon  called syntrophism.<br />
          Many micro organic synthesize the  vitamins and anaerobic acids in excess of their nutritional requirements.  Others have a requirement of one or more of these nutrients.  Hence certain combinations of species will grow  together but not apart when nutrient levels are very low.<br />
          Nutritional proto co-operation has  been demonstrated in cultures.  Eg: In a  medium deficient in nicotinic acid and biotin, neither <em>Proteus vulgaris</em> nor <em>Bacillus  polymyxa</em> will multiply as the former (B) requires nicotinic acid and the  latter biotin. In mixed culture, in the same medium however both grown since  the partner bacterium synthesizes the missing vitamins. <br />
<strong>c) Symbiosis</strong><br />
          The living together of two or more  organisms; microbial association<br />
          Symbiotic association is evident in  soil among several groups of organisms algae and fungi in lichens, bacteria  residing with in protozoa cells, bacteria and roots in the  legume symbiosis, fungi and roots in mycoorhizae.<br />
          In lichens, the algae and fungi are in  such an intimate physical and physiological relationship that the lichens they  make are classified as distinct organism.   The alga benefits in part are se of the protection afforded to it by the  hyphae that envelop and protect it from environmental stresses. While, the  fungi gains by making use of the CO2 fixed by its photosynthetic  partner.  Where BGA participants, the  heterotraph benefits from the fixed N2.<br />
          Symbiotic relationship exists between  micro and macro organisms.  R-L associate  N2 fixed is transferred to legume and organic which is transferred  to the ® by CO2 metabolizing legume host. </p>

                  <img width="343" height="176" src="lec29_clip_image002.jpg" /><strong> </strong></p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>d)  Commensalisms</strong><br />
				  It is the type of beneficial  association, in which only one species derives benefit while the other is  unaffected.  This occurs commonly in soil  with respect to degradation of complex molecules like cellulose and lignin. One  patter can attack a substrate not available to the second organism, but the  decomposition results in the formation of products utilized by the second.  The one which offer eg: (1) Many fungi able  to degrade cellulose and yield glucose and organic acids. This can serve as a  which source for many bacteria and fungi, which are non cellulolytic (2) The  second type of commensal association arises from the need of many micro organic  for growth factors.  These compounds are  synthesized by many micro organisms and their exertion permits the proliferation  of nutritionally fastidious soil inhabitants.</p>

                    <strong>III.  Negative / harmful / deleterious interactions</strong><br />
				  Detrimental effects of one species on  its neighbours are quite common in soil, and they are ditched by the decreases  in abundance or metabolic activities of the susceptible organisms.<br />
				  This include<br />
				  a)  Competition<br />
				  b)  Amensalism<br />
				  c)  Parasitism and predation<br />
  <strong>a.  Competition</strong><br />
				  It is the rivalry for limiting  nutrients or other common needs.  In such  situations the best adapted microbial species will predominate or infact,  eliminate other species which are dependent upon the same limited nutrient  substances.<br />
				  Eg:  Competition between strains derived from soil and those applied with legume  seeds at the time of sowing.  The better  competitor involves the root hairs more frequently and it is responsible for a  high % of nodules.</p>
				<p><img width="293" height="220" src="lec29_clip_image002_0001.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="Description: 220px-Clone_war_of_sea_anemones_2-17-08-2.jpg" /> <br />
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Anemones">Sea Anemones</a> compete for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)">territory</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide_pools">tide pools</a> </p>
				<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>b.  Amensalism</strong><br />
				  It is a negative interaction, in which  the release of products by one species is toxic to its neighbours.  Antagonism is a type of ammensalism.  </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="left"><strong>. Antagonism</strong><br />
                  <img width="304" height="295" src="lec29_clip_image002_0002.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="Description: images.jpg" />  The  killing, injury or inhibition of growth of one species of micro organisms by  another or when one organism adversely affects the environmental of the other  is refered as antagonism. <br />
         <br /> 
The toxic compounds are  antibiotic.  An antibiotic is a substance  formed by one organic that in low concentrations inhibits the growth of another  organism.  Antibiotics are common among <em>Streptomyces </em>isolates, but numerous  strains of <em>Micromonespora</em> and <em>Nocardia</em> are also active.  The most common frequently encountered (B)  synthesis antibiosis are species of <em>Bacillus</em> strains of <em>Pseudomonas</em> species of <em>Peniciliu, Trichoderma</em>, <em>Aspgerillus</em>, <em>Fusarium</em> are also excrete antibiotic substance.<br />
          <br />
Anitimicrobial compounds against (F)  are present in the soil, which inhibit the germination of fungal spores.  This phenomenon is termed as fungistasis.  Cyanide is produced by certain (F) in concentrations toxic to other  microorganisms, and algae elaborate fatty acids which exhibit and marked  antibacterial activity other metabolic products that may result from microbial  activity in soil, which are likely to be inhibiting to other species are CH4,  sulfides and other volatile S compounds.  <em>B. t </em>toxin to lepidopteran  insect pestd<br />
          <br />
Myxobacteria (slime (B)) and  streptomyces are antagonistic because they secrete potent lytic enzymes which  destroy other cells by digesting their cell wall.  The degraded cellular material as well as  they released protoplasmic material, which serve as nutrients.<br />
<strong>d. Predation</strong><br />
          Direct attack of one organism on  another predation is one of the most dramatic interrelationships among the  micro organic in nature of the many microscopic inhabitants of soil, the  bacteria stand out as particularly prove to the attach of predators. The most  numerous predators on (B) are protozoans, which by feeding on the billions of  (B) undisputedly affect their populations.   Protozoans are a key factor in limiting the size of bacterial  populations.  Probably reducing the  abundance of cells and serving to maintain a diverse community.</p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Myxobacteria       and cellular slime molds also affect by feeding directly on them</li>
				  <li>Bacteria       of the diverse genera are attacked by bacteriophages </li>
				  <li><em>Bdellovibrio</em> is ubiquitous, capable of attacking a number       of bacterial genera.</li>
			    </ul>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Parasitism       is between two types of (B), or between different organisms of the same       group (F, B, A).</li>
				  <li>Creation       of conditions by one organism which are unfavorable for the growth of       another (change in pH).</li>
				  <li>Production       of  specific substances by one       organisms which are injurious to growth of other ( organic alcohols,       quinones and antibiotics)</li>
				  <li>Direct       parasitism of one organism upon another- various effects of (F) upon (B),       of (B) upon (F). </li>
		        </ol>
				<p><img width="326" height="293" src="lec29_clip_image002_0003.jpg" alt="Description: ecosystem_predation.jpg" /> <br />
e. Parasitism                                              <br />
 Is a form of symbiosis in which  one organism benefits and the other is harmed. An example of parasitism is <em>wasp’s eggs and caterpillar</em>. When the eggs hatch  into young wasps, these young wasps burrow into the body of the caterpillar.  The young wasps feed on the caterpillar’s tissues. After a month or so, the  young wasps chew their way out of the dying caterpillar’s body and spin  cocoons. Afterwards, the young wasps become adult wasps. This is parasitism,  because the caterpillar is harmed while the young wasps benefit from feeding on  the caterpillar.</p>
