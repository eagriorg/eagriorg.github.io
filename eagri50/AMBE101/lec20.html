				<p align="justify">Composting is the active process of converting organic material to  more stabilized forms of C through the action of microorganisms. Specifically,  composting is the biological decomposition of wastes consisting of organic  substances of plant or animal origin under controlled conditions to a state  sufficiently stable for storage and utilization (Diaz <em>et al.</em>, 1993).  Compost as a product can be used in gardens, in nurseries, and on agricultural  land. With respect to management of organisms, composting is perhaps the prime  example since we manage the microbial process and the microbial product and  manage the use of compost in microbially based systems (Cooperband, 2002). As  the compost definition implies, practically any plant or animal material can be  composted. Compost plays a major role in the agriculture of developing  countries using organic agriculture and biodynamic farming, being relied upon  to provide organic matter and nutrients and increase soil tilth. It also plays  a role in processing the human waste stream. The United States alone produces  nearly 10 MMT of sewage sludge and 185 MMT of garbage annually, on a dry weight  basis. Less than 15% of municipal solid waste is recycled; however, more than  30% of the sewage sludge is beneficially used as composted products (Rynk,  1992; http://compost.css.cornell.edu/OnFarmHandbook).</p>
				<p align="justify">				  Traditionally yard waste is thought of as “the” compost material;  however, manure, meat and dairy waste, wood, sawdust, and crop residue can be  composted. In addition, animal carcass composting is receiving significant  attention due to the environmental benefits versus burial, which can contribute  to groundwater contamination.</p>
				<p align="justify">				  One important aspect of the material that affects the compost  process and product is the C:N ratio of the starting material, ideally it  should be 25 to 30:1. Typical C:N ratios of different materials are shown in  Table below:</p>

				<p align="justify">The organisms and processes occurring during composting of straw.  The length of time varies with outside temperature and extent of mixing but  usually involves 200 days (from W. R. Horwath, personal communication).</p>
				<p align="justify">Materials can be  mixed to adjust the C:N ratio for a consistent product. There are numerous  methods used for preparing materials and the environment for the composting  process, including using waste materials alone, mixing organic materials of  different quality, adding external nutrients and/or inocula, and controlling  the physical environment to promote aerobic or anaerobic decomposition. In  compost terminology, process strategy refers to the management of the  biological and chemical activity of the composting process. The biological  processing uses terminology referring to the stage of the composting, such as  active stage (mesophilic), high-rate stage (thermophilic), controlled  (cooling), and curing stage (maturing) (Fig. 17.2). Configuration refers to the  physical management of the process such as using piles, stacks, or windrows.  Composting configurations range from windrow or open systems to enclosed  systems, with windrow further classified as either static or turned. An example  of a static system would be a stationary undisturbed mound of organic material  with air being forced up through the mound or pulled down through the mound. In  contrast, a turned system uses mixing as the aeration method, which also  enhances the uniformity of decomposition and reduction in material particle  size. The turned system is considered the traditional composting method for  organic material (see Diaz <em>et al</em>., 1993, for more detail). With any  composting system managing the composting process will consistently produce  compost with the desired characteristics.</p>
				<p align="justify">				  The  most prevalent composting technique is aerobic decomposition, carried out by a  diverse microbial population that changes composition as conditions change.  This method is preferred since it proceeds more rapidly and provides a greater  reduction in pathogens and weed seeds because higher temperatures are achieved.  Physiochemical factors affecting aerobic composting are temperature, moisture,  aeration, pH, additives, particle size, and the C:N ratio of the composted  substrate. Mostly indigenous organism populations are used for the composting  process; microbial inoculants are utilized only under certain conditions.  Figure 17.2 depicts the process of composting straw for 200 days under optimum  conditions of temperature and moisture. In the mesophilic stage metabolism of  the labile-C-rich substrates increases rapidly, generating heat. At this point  there is a mixture of bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi contributing to the  decomposition process. In the early and transition stage to thermophilic  conditions the windrow is turned, causing a decline in temperature and  oxygenation of the inner material, resulting in rapid decomposition and  temperature increase. As the temperature reaches 40°C the system turns from a  mesophilic to a thermophilic stage, favoring mainly thermophilic bacteria and  actinomycetes, with <em>Bacillus </em>being the dominant genus. Common <em>Bacillus </em>species found at this stage, and accounting for 10% of the decomposition,  are <em>brevis</em>, <em>circulans</em>, <em>coagulans</em>, <em>licheniformis</em>,  and <em>subtilis</em>. Decomposition will continue in the thermophilic zone until  substrates begin to decline, then a gradual decrease in temperature will occur.</p>
				<p align="justify">				  As the temperature declines the mesophilic  organisms reappear, especially fungi that have preference for the remaining  lignin and cellulose substrates. Fungi, responsible for 30 to 40% of the  decomposition the compost material, include <em>Absidia</em>, <em>Mucor</em>, and <em>Allescheria </em>spp., <em>haetomium</em>, <em>thermophilum</em>, <em>dactylomyces</em>. The  actinomycetes, such as the <em>Norcardia </em>spp., <em>Streptomyces thermofuscus</em>,  and <em>S. thermoviolaceus </em>are important in this phase when humic materials  are formed from decomposition and condensation reactions. The actinomycetes are  estimated to account for 15 to 30% of the decomposition of composted material.</p>
				<p align="justify">				  The  compost produced from this process is lower in C than the initial material, has  a lower C:N and a higher pH, and can contain considerable NO3. The  end product of composting depends on the original substrate, any added  nutrients, degree of maturity, and composting method; typical properties of  composted plant material are listed in Table 17.4. Adding compost to soil  increases the SOM, which increases soil structure and water-holding capacity  and infiltration. In addition, compost contains significant amounts of plant  nutrients such as N, P, K, and S and micronutrients, which are slowly released  into the soil. As an ancillary benefit compost contains fairly resistant C  compounds and may be dominated by fungi. Using compost on a garden or  agricultural soil would favor an increase in the population of fungi and thus  an increase in the fungi:bacteria ratio. Fungi are very abundant in soils and  can constitute as much biomass as roots and as a group they are also the major  organic matter decomposers in soil. Increasing the soil fungal population can  increase C compounds that are agents in binding soil particles into aggregates,  which increase soil tilth. Recent studies (Bailey <em>et al.</em>, 2002)  haveshown there is increased soil C storage in soils with greater  fungal:bacterial ratios. Thus, as a consequence of using compost on our soil we  have managed the soil microorganism population to our benefit.</p>

				<p align="justify"><strong>CROP ROTATIONS  AND GREEN MANURES</strong><br />
			    Crop  rotations have been practiced over the long history of agriculture. Studies  dating from the 1840s on have shown that N supplied to grain crops was the  major reason for using crop rotations containing legumes (Triplett and  Mannering, 1978). With the advent of inexpensive nitrogen fertilizers, crop  rotations containing legumes declined. Only recently has the value of crop  rotations specifically including legumes been recognized as critical in  maintaining SOM and soil productivity. Researchers in Canada studied the  nutrient dynamics in a Canadian Luvisol after 50 years of cropping to a 2-year  rotation (wheat–fallow) or a 5-year rotation (wheat–oats–barley–forage–forage)  (McGill <em>et al</em>., 1986). Their results showed that the soil cropped to the  5-year rotation contained greater amounts of organic C and N. In addition they  found that microbial turnover (i.e., carbon mineralization) was twice as fast  in the 2-year rotation. The 5-year rotation doubled the input of carbon into  the soil over the 2-year system and had a greater percentage of organic C and N  in biological form. These results suggest that longer cropping system rotations  that include forage or legumes will conserve SOM, maintain a greater biological  nutrient pool, and put more nutrients into the soil than intensive rotations.</p>
				<p align="justify">				  In a 10-year study, a  low-input diverse crop system with manure and a low-input cash grain system  with legumes showed significant increases in SOM compared to a conventional  corn/soybean rotation (Wander <em>et al</em>., 1994). In addition, in both  low-input (multiple crop rotations) systems the microbial biomass was greater  and its activity higher than the conventional rotation of corn/soybeans with  chemical inputs. The low-input systems also mineralized significantly more N  and the microbial biomass contained 33 kg N ha_1 more N than the conventional  system. </p>
				<p align="justify">n agricultural  systems, plant pathogens are an important part of the soil microbial community.  As growers reduce tillage and incorporate a greater variety of crops in  rotation they face an increasing number of plant diseases that can cause  significant stand and yield reductions. These potential losses, however, may be  offset in systems incorporating green manures by promoting disease-suppressing  properties that reduce plant pathogens, either (1) by increasing the levels of  SOM that create conditions supporting a greater microbial biomass, competition  for resources, antibiosis, or antagonism or (2) through direct inhibition by  production of antibacterial/fungal compounds as in the case of <em>Brassica </em>cover  crops that produce isothiocyanates. Cover crops are known to control  disease-causing organisms through competition for resources and space, control  of soil micronutrient status, and alteration of root growth.				</p>
