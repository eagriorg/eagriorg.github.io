				<p>The term <strong>Industrial  Microbiology</strong> refers to the use of microorganisms for industrial  purposes. Such things as anticoagulants, antidepressants, vasodilators,  herbicides, insecticides, plant hormones, enzymes, and vitamins have been isolated  from microorganisms or produced in large quantities by genetically engineering  the organisms with foreign genes. In commercial industrial plants,  microorganisms are widely used to produce numerous organic materials that have  far-reaching value and application.<br />
                  <strong>Antibiotic  production</strong><br />
            These are defined as substances produced by some micro-organisms which are in some way lethal to other micro-organisms. It is  thought that these substances give the organisms that produce them (usually  moulds or actinomycetes - which grow slowly) some sort of advantage in  competition with other micro-organisms (usually bacteria - which grow fast) in  the same habitat. However, their great medical advantage in  healing infections is that the purified forms of antibiotics are more or less harmless to most humans. This means  that they must act on some aspect of of the growth of micro-organisms which  differs from ordinary mammalian cells. There are in fact several versions of  Penicillin, variations on a common formula, produced by different strains of  Penicillium, or using different culture media and methods.<br />
The <strong>Production of Antibiotics</strong> has been widespread since the  pioneering efforts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Walter_Florey" title="Howard Walter Florey">Florey</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Boris_Chain" title="Ernst Boris Chain">Chain</a> in 1938. The  importance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotics" title="Antibiotics">antibiotics</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine" title="Medicine">medicine</a> has led to much research into their discovery and  production.<br />
<strong>Identifying Useful Antibiotics</strong><br />
<img border="0" width="250" height="188" src="lec32_clip_image002.jpg" /> <br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Agar_plate_with_colonies.jpg" title="Enlarge"><img border="0" width="15" height="11" src="lec32_clip_image003.gif" /></a> <br />
An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar_plate" title="Agar plate">agar plate</a> streaked with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism" title="Microorganism">microorganisms</a>.<br />
Despite the wide variety of known antibiotics, less  than 1% of antimicrobial agents have medical or commercial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_%28economics%29" title="Value (economics)">value</a>. For example, whereas <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin" title="Penicillin">penicillin</a> has a high <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index" title="Therapeutic index">therapeutic index</a> as it does not generally affect human cells, this is not so for many  antibiotics. Other antibiotics simply lack advantage over those already in use,  or have no other practical applications.<br />
Useful antibiotics are often discovered using a  screening process. To conduct such a screen, isolates of many different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism" title="Microorganism">microorganisms</a> are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture" title="Microbiological culture">cultured</a> and then tested for production of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion" title="Diffusion">diffusible</a> products that inhibit the growth of test organisms. Most antibiotics  identified in such a screen are already known and must therefore be  disregarded. The remainder must be tested for their selective toxicities and  therapeutic activities, and the best candidates can be examined and possibly  modified.<br />
A more modern version of this approach is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_drug_design" title="Rational drug design">rational design</a> program. This involves screening directed  towards finding new natural products that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor" title="Enzyme inhibitor">inhibit</a> a specific target, such as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzyme</a> only found in the target pathogen, rather  than tests to show general inhibition of a culture.</p>
				<h2>Industrial Production Techniques </h2>
				<p>Antibiotics are produced industrially by a process of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_fermentation" title="Industrial fermentation">fermentation</a>, where the source microorganism is grown in large  containers (100,000–150,000 liters or more) containing a liquid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium" title="Growth medium">growth medium</a>. Oxygen  concentration, temperature, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH" title="PH">pH</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient" title="Nutrient">nutrient</a> levels must  be optimal, and are closely monitored and adjusted if necessary. As antibiotics  are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_metabolite" title="Secondary metabolite">secondary metabolites</a>, the population size must be controlled very carefully to  ensure that maximum yield is obtained before the cells die. Once the process is  complete, the antibiotic must be extracted and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purification" title="Purification">purified</a> to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal" title="Crystal">crystalline</a> product.  This is simpler to achieve if the antibiotic is soluble in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soluble" title="Soluble">organic solvent</a>.  Otherwise it must first be removed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_exchange" title="Ion exchange">ion exchange</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption" title="Adsorption">adsorption</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_%28chemistry%29" title="Precipitation (chemistry)">chemical  precipitation</a>.</p>
				<h2> Strains Used For Production </h2>
				<p>Microorganisms used in fermentation are rarely identical to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type" title="Wild type">wild type</a>. This is  because species are often <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism" title="Genetically modified organism">genetically  modified</a> to yield the maximum amounts of  antibiotics. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation" title="Mutation">Mutation</a> is often used, and is encouraged by introducing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutagen" title="Mutagen">mutagens</a> such as  ultraviolet radiation, x-rays or certain chemicals. Selection and further <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction" title="Reproduction">reproduction</a> of the  higher yielding strains over many generations can raise yields by 20-fold or  more. Another technique used to increase yields is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene" title="Gene">gene</a> amplification, where copies of genes coding for enzymes  involved in the antibiotic production can be inserted back into a cell, via  vectors such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid" title="Plasmid">plasmids</a>. This process must be closely linked with retesting of  antibiotic production and effectiveness.<br />
                    <strong>WINE PRODUCTION</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                    <strong>Winemaking</strong>, or <strong>Vinification</strong>, is  the production of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine" title="Wine">wine</a>,  starting with selection of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape" title="Grape">grapes</a> or other produce and ending with bottling the finished  wine. Although most wine is made from grapes, it may also be made from other  fruit or non-toxic plant material. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead" title="Mead">Mead</a> is a wine that is made with honey being the primary  ingredient after water.<br />
				  Winemaking can  be divided into two general categories: still wine production (without  carbonation) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkling_wine" title="Sparkling wine">sparkling wine</a> production (with carbonation).<br />
				  The science of  wine and winemaking is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oenology" title="Oenology">oenology</a> (in American  English, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enology" title="Enology">enology</a>).<br />
  <img border="0" width="360" height="270" src="lec32_clip_image004.jpg" /> <br />
  <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57X-GAtTbeA">PROCESS</a></strong><br />
				  After the harvest, the grapes are taken into a winery and prepared  for primary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_%28wine%29" title="Fermentation (wine)">ferment</a>, at this stage red wine making diverges from white wine  making. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_wine" title="Red wine">Red wine</a> is made from  the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Must" title="Must">must</a> (pulp) of red or  black grapes that undergo fermentation together with the grape skins. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_wine" title="White wine">White wine</a> is made by  fermenting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juice" title="Juice">juice</a> which is made by  pressing crushed grapes to extract a juice; the skins are removed and play no  further role. Occasionally white wine is made from red grapes, this is done by  extracting their juice with minimal contact with the grapes' skins. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ros%C3%A9" title="Rosé">Rosé</a> wines are made  from red grapes where the juice is allowed to stay in contact with the dark  skins long enough to pick up a pinkish color, but little of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannin" title="Tannin">tannins</a> contained in the skins.</p>
				<p>To start primary fermentation yeast is added to the must for red  wine or juice for white wine. During this fermentation, which often takes  between one and two weeks, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast" title="Yeast">yeast</a> converts most of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugars</a> in the grape juice into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a> (alcohol) and  carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is lost to the atmosphere. After the primary  fermentation of red grapes the free run wine is pumped off into tanks and the  skins are pressed to extract the remaining juice and wine, the press wine  blended with the free run wine at the wine makers discretion. The wine is kept  warm and the remaining <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugars_in_wine" title="Sugars in wine">sugars</a> are converted  into alcohol and carbon dioxide. The next process in the making of red wine is  secondary fermentation. This is a bacterial fermentation which converts malic  acid to lactic acid. This process decreases the acid in the wine and softens  the taste of the wine. Red wine is sometimes transferred to oak barrels to  mature for a period of weeks or months, this practice imparts oak <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromas_%28wine%29" title="Aromas (wine)">aromas</a> to the wine.  The wine must be settled or clarified and adjustments made prior to filtration  and bottling.<br />
The time from harvest to drinking can vary from a few months for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaujolais_nouveau" title="Beaujolais nouveau">Beaujolais nouveau</a> wines to over twenty years for top wines. However, only  about 10% of all red and 5% of white wine will taste better after five years  than it will after just one year. Depending on the quality of grape and the  target wine style, some of these steps may be combined or omitted to achieve  the particular goals of the winemaker. Many wines of comparable quality are produced  using similar but distinctly different approaches to their production; quality  is dictated by the attributes of the starting material and not necessarily the  steps taken during vinification.<br />
Variations on the above procedure exist. With sparkling wines such  as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne_%28wine%29" title="Champagne (wine)">Champagne</a>, an additional fermentation takes place inside the bottle,  trapping carbon dioxide and creating the characteristic bubbles. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetness_of_wine" title="Sweetness of wine">Sweet wines</a> are made  by ensuring that some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_sugar" title="Residual sugar">residual sugar</a> remains  after fermentation is completed. This can be done by harvesting late (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_harvest_wine" title="Late harvest wine">late harvest wine</a>),  freezing the grapes to concentrate the sugar (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_wine" title="Ice wine">ice wine</a>), or adding a  substance to kill the remaining yeast before fermentation is completed; for  example, high <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_%28alcohol%29" title="Proof (alcohol)">proof</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy" title="Brandy">brandy</a> is added when making <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_wine" title="Port wine">port wine</a>. In other  cases the winemaker may choose to hold back some of the sweet grape juice and  add it to the wine after the fermentation is done, a technique known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%BCssreserve" title="Süssreserve">süssreserve</a>.<br />
The process produces <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winery_Wastewater" title="Winery Wastewater">wastewater</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomace" title="Pomace">pomace</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lees_%28fermentation%29" title="Lees (fermentation)">lees</a> that require collection, treatment, and disposal or  beneficial use.<br />

				<p><strong>SINGLE  CELL PROTEIN</strong><br />
				  <strong>Single cell protein</strong><strong> (SCP)</strong> typically refers to sources of mixed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a> extracted from  pure or mixed cultures of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae" title="Algae">algae</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeasts" title="Yeasts">yeasts</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi" title="Fungi">fungi</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a> (grown on agricultural wastes) used as a substitute for  protein-rich foods, in human and animal feeds. <img border="0" width="274" height="182" src="lec32_clip_image004_0000.jpg" /> <img border="0" width="297" height="180" src="lec32_clip_image006.jpg" /> <br />
  <strong>History</strong><br />
				  Early history Since 2500 BC yeasts have been used in  bread and beverage production. In 1781 processes for preparing highly  concentrated forms of yeast were established. In 1919 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Endomyces_vernalis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Endomyces vernalis (page does not exist)"><em>Endomyces  vernalis</em></a> yielded fats from sulphite liquor (from paper manufacture), and  similarly in 1941 employing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotrichum" title="Geotrichum">Geotrichum</a>. <br />
  <strong>&quot;Food from oil&quot;</strong><br />
				  In the 1960s, researchers at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Petroleum" title="British Petroleum">British Petroleum</a> developed what they called &quot;proteins-from-oil process&quot;: a  technology for producing single cell protein by yeast fed by waxy n-paraffins,  a product produced by oil refineries. Initial research work was done by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Champagnat&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Alfred Champagnat (page does not exist)">Alfred  Champagnat</a> at  BP's Lavera Oil Refinery in France;  a small pilot plant there started operations in March in 1963, and the same  construction of the second pilot plant, at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grangemouth_Refinery" title="Grangemouth Refinery">Grangemouth Oil Refinery</a> in Britain, was authorized. The term  SCP was coined in 1966 by Carol L. Wilson at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT" title="MIT">MIT</a>. <br />
				  The &quot;food from oil&quot; idea became quite  popular by the 1970s, with Champagnat being awarded the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO_Science_Prize" title="UNESCO Science Prize">UNESCO Science Prize</a> in 1976, and paraffin-fed yeast  facilities being built in a number of countries. The primary use of the product  was as poultry and cattle feed. <br />
				  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviets</a> were particularly enthusiastic, opening large &quot;BVK&quot; (<em>belkovo-vitaminny  kontsentrat</em>, i.e., &quot;protein-vitamin concentrate&quot;) plants next to  their oil refineries in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kstovo" title="Kstovo">Kstovo</a> (1973) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirishi" title="Kirishi">Kirishi</a> (1974). The Soviet Ministry of Microbiological Industry had eight  plants of this kind by 1989, when, pressured by the environmentalist movements,  the government decided to close them down, or convert to some other  microbiological processes. </p>
				<h2>SCP Production Process </h2>
				<p>Single cell proteins develop when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbes" title="Microbes">microbes</a> ferment waste  materials (including wood, straw, cannery and food processing wastes, residues  from alcohol production, hydrocarbons, or human and animal excreta). The  problem with extracting single cell proteins from the wastes is the dilution  and cost. They are found in very low concentrations, usually less than 5%. Engineers have developed ways to increase the  concentrations including centrifugation, flotation, precipitation, coagulation  and filtration, or the use of semi-permeable membranes.<br />
				  The single cell protein needs to be dehydrated to approximately  10% moisture content and/or acidified to aid in storage and prevent spoilage.  The methods to increase the concentrations to adequate levels, and de-watering  process require equipment that is expensive and not always suitable for  small-scale operations. It is economically prudent to feed the product locally  and shortly after it is produced.</p>

                    <strong>Examples:</strong><br />
				  Microbes employed include yeasts (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae" title="Saccharomyces cerevisiae">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a><em>, </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_utilis" title="Candida utilis"><em>Candida utilis</em></a><em>=Torulopsis</em> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotrichum_candidum" title="Geotrichum candidum"><em>Geotrichum candidum</em></a>(=Oidium lactis)), other fungi (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_oryzae" title="Aspergillus oryzae"><em>Aspergillus oryzae</em></a><em>, </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerotium_rolfsii" title="Sclerotium rolfsii"><em>Sclerotium rolfsii</em></a><em>, </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyporus" title="Polyporus"><em>Polyporus</em></a><em> and </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichoderma" title="Trichoderma"><em>Trichoderma</em></a>), bacteria (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rhodopseudomonas_capsulata&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Rhodopseudomonas capsulata (page does not exist)"><em>Rhodopseudomonas</em> <em>capsulata</em></a>). and algae (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorella" title="Chlorella"><em>Chlorella</em></a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirulina" title="Spirulina"><em>Spirulina</em></a>). Typical yields of 43 to 56%, with  protein contents of 44% to 60%.<br />

				<ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>low-cost       aseptic conditions,</li>
				  <li>avoiding       over 100-fold dilution of the acidic hydrolysates to pH values needed for       other microbes</li>
				  <li>after the       biomass is harvested, the acids can be reused. </li>
			    </ol>
				<p>Commercial production of SCP (Spirulina) includes Cyanotech in Hawaii and Earthrise in California. TOPRINA- scp made from condidor  lipolytica in uk  PRUTEEN-SCP made from methanol. TORUTEIN- SCP made from ethanol using torula  yeast.</p>
				<h2>Advantages of Production of SCP </h2>
				<p>Large-scale  production of microbial biomass has many advantages over the traditional  methods for producing proteins for food or feed.<br />
				  1.  Microorganisms have a high rate of multiplication to hence rapid succession of  generation (algae: 2-6 hours, yeast: 1-3 hours, bacteria: 0.5-2 hours)<br />
				  2. They can be  easily genetically modified for varying the amino acid composition.<br />
				  3. A very high  protein content 43-85&nbsp;% in the dry mass.<br />
				  4. They can  utilize a broad spectrum of raw materials as carbon sources, which include even  waste products. Thus they help in the removal of pollutants also.<br />
				  5. Strains with  high yield and good composition can be selected or produce relatively easily.<br />
				  6. Microbial  biomass production occurs in continuous cultures and the quality is consistent  since the growth is independent of seasonal and climatic variations.<br />
				  7. Land  requirements is low and is ecologically beneficial.<br />
				  8.  A high solar energy conversion efficiency per  unit area.<br />
				  9. Solar energy  conversion efficiency can be maximized and yield can be enhanced by easy  regulation of physical and nutritional factors.<br />
				  10. Algal  culture can be done in space which is normally unused and so there is no need  to compete for land.<br />
  <strong>Microbes  in Cheese and Yoghurt </strong><br />

Fermentation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose" title="Lactose">lactose</a> produces <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid" title="Lactic acid">lactic acid</a>, which acts on milk <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a> to give yoghurt its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_%28food%29" title="Texture (food)">texture</a> and its characteristic tang. Dairy yoghurt is produced  using a culture of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_delbrueckii_subsp._bulgaricus" title="Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus"><em>Lactobacillus  delbrueckii</em> subsp. <em>bulgaricus</em></a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_salivarius_subsp._thermophilus" title="Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus"><em>Streptococcus salivarius</em> subsp. <em>thermophilus</em></a> bacteria. The milk is heated  to about 80 °C to kill any undesirable bacteria and to change the milk proteins  so that they set together rather than form curds. It is then cooled to about 45  °C. The bacteria culture is added, and this temperature is maintained for 4 to  7 hours for fermentation. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soy_yogurt" title="Soy yogurt">Soy yoghurt</a>, a non-dairy yoghurt alternative, is made from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soy_milk" title="Soy milk">soy milk</a>. <br />

It has nutritional benefits beyond those of milk. People who are  moderately <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance" title="Lactose intolerance">lactose-intolerant</a> can consume yoghurt without ill effects,  because much of the lactose in the milk precursor is converted to lactic acid  by the bacterial culture. Yoghurt may also be used in preventing  antibiotic-associated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea" title="Diarrhea">diarrhea</a>. Yoghurt is believed to promote good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva" title="Gingiva">gum</a> health, possibly because of the effect of lactic acid present in yoghurt. <br />
				  A study published in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Journal_of_Obesity" title="International Journal of Obesity"><em>International  Journal of Obesity</em></a> (11 January 2005) also found that the consumption of low-fat yoghurt  can promote weight loss, especially due to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium" title="Calcium">calcium</a> in the yoghurt. </p>

It is found in different flavours, two of which are  famous: sour yoghurt (<em>tauk doi</em>) and sweet yoghurt (<em>meesti</em> or <em>podi  doi</em>). In India,  it is often used in cosmetics mixed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmeric" title="Turmeric">turmeric</a> and honey.

				<h3>Sweetened and flavored yoghurt </h3>
				<p>To offset its natural <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour" title="Sour">sourness</a>, yoghurt can be sold sweetened, flavored or in containers  with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruit</a> or fruit jam on  the bottom.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoghurt#cite_note-20">[21]</a> If the  fruit has been stirred into the yoghurt before purchase, it is commonly  referred to as Swiss-style.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoghurt#cite_note-21">[22]</a> Most  yoghurts in North America] have  added <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectin" title="Pectin">pectin</a>, found  naturally in fruit, and/or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin" title="Gelatin">gelatin</a> to artificially create thickness and creaminess at lower  cost. This type of adulterated product is also marketed under the name  Swiss-style, although it is unrelated to the way yoghurt is eaten in Switzerland.  Some yoghurts, often called &quot;cream line,&quot; are made with whole milk  which has not been homogenized so the cream rises to the top. Fruit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam" title="Jam">jam</a> is used instead of raw fruit pieces in fruit yoghurts to  allow storage for weeks.

In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America" title="United States of America">USA</a>, sweetened, flavored yoghurt is the most popular type,  typically sold in single-serving plastic cups.

				<h3>Strained yoghurts </h3>
				<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strained_yoghurt" title="Strained yoghurt">Strained yoghurts</a> are  types of yoghurt which are strained through a paper or cloth filter,  traditionally made of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslin" title="Muslin">muslin</a>, to remove the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whey" title="Whey">whey</a>,  giving a much thicker consistency and a distinctive, slightly tangy taste.<br />
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labneh" title="Labneh">Labneh</a> is a strained yoghurt used  for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwiches" title="Sandwiches">sandwiches</a> popular in  Arab countries. Olive oil, cucumber slices, olives, and various green herbs may  be added. It can be thickened further and rolled into balls, preserved in olive  oil, and fermented for a few more weeks. It is sometimes used with onions,  meat, and nuts as a stuffing for a variety of pies or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kebbeh" title="Kebbeh">kebbeh</a> balls. Some types of  strained yoghurts are boiled in open vats first, so that the liquid content is  reduced. The popular East Indian dessert, a variation of traditional dahi  called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishti_doi" title="Mishti doi">mishti dahi</a>, offers a thicker, more custard-like consistency, and is  usually sweeter than western yoghurts. Strained  yoghurt is also enjoyed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a> and is the main  component of <em>tzadziki</em>, a well-known accompaniment to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyros" title="Gyros">gyros</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souvlaki" title="Souvlaki">souvlaki</a> pita sandwiches.</p>
