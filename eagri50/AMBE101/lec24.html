				<p align="justify">What is Fermentation ?  Fermentation is the chemical transformation of organic substances into simpler  compounds by the action of enzymes, complex organic catalysts, which are  produced by microorganisms such as molds, yeasts, or bacteria. Enzymes act by  hydrolysis, a process of breaking down or predigesting complex organic  molecules to form smaller (and in the case of foods, more easily digestible)  compounds and nutrients. For example, the enzyme protease breaks down huge  protein molecules first into polypeptides and peptides, then into numerous  amino acids, which are readily assimilated by the body. The enzyme amylase  works on carbohydrates, reducing starches and complex sugars to simple sugars.  And the enzyme lipase hydrolyzes complex fat molecules into simpler free fatty  acids. These are but three of the more important enzymes. There are thousands  more, both inside and outside of our bodies. In some fermentations, important  by-products such as alcohol or various gases are also produced. The word  &quot;fermentation&quot; is derived from the Latin meaning &quot;to boil,&quot;  since the bubbling and foaming of early fermenting beverages seemed closely  akin to boiling.</p>
				<p align="justify">				  Fermented  foods often have numerous advantages over the raw materials from which they are  made. As applied to soyfoods, fermentation not only makes the end product more  digestible, it can also create improved (in many cases meatlike) flavor and  texture, appearance and aroma, synthesize vitamins, destroy or mask undesirable  or beany flavors, reduce or eliminate carbohydrates believed to cause  flatulence, decrease the required cooking time, and increase storage life. Most  fermentations are activated by either molds, yeasts, or bacteria, working  singularly or together. The great majority of these microorganisms come from a  relatively small number of genera; roughly eight genera of molds, five of  yeasts, and six of bacteria. An even smaller number are used to make fermented  soyfoods: the molds are <em>Aspergillus </em>, <em>Rhizopus </em>, <em>Mucor </em>, <em>Actinomucor </em>, and <em>Neurospora </em>species; the yeasts are <em>Saccharomyces </em>species;  and the bacteria are <em>Bacillus </em>and <em>Pediococcus </em>species plus any or  all of the species used to make fermented milk products. Molds and yeasts  belong to the fungus kingdom, the study of which is called mycology. Fungi are  as distinct from true plants as they are from animals. The study of all  microorganisms is called microbiology. While microorganisms are the most  intimate friends of the food industry, they are also its ceaseless adversaries.  They have long been used to make foods and beverages, yet they can also cause  them to spoil. When used wisely and creatively, however, microorganisms are an  unexploitable working class, whose very nature is to labor tirelessly day and  night, never striking or complaining, ceaselessly providing human beings with new  foods. Like human beings, but unlike plants, microorganisms cannot make  carbohydrates from carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight. They need a substrate  to feed and grow on. The fermented foods they make are created incidentally as  they live and grow.</p>
				<p align="justify">				  Human beings are  known to have made fermented foods since Neolithic times. The earliest types  were beer, wine, and leavened bread (made primarily by yeasts) and cheeses  (made by bacteria and molds). These were soon followed by East Asian fermented  foods, yogurt and other fermented milk products, pickles, sauerkraut, vinegar  (soured wine), butter, and a host of traditional alcoholic beverages. More  recently molds have been used in industrial fermentation to make vitamins B-2  (riboflavin) and B-12, textured protein products (from <em>Fusarium </em>and <em>Rhizopus </em>in Europe) antibiotics (such as penicillin), citric acid, and gluconic  acid. Bacteria are now used to make the amino acids lysine and glutamic acid.  Single-celled protein foods such as nutritional yeast and microalgae  (spirulina, chlorella) are also made in modern industrial fermentations.</p>
				<p align="justify">				  For early  societies, the transformation of basic food materials into fermented foods was  a mystery and a miracle, for they had no idea what caused the usually sudden,  dramatic, and welcomed transformation. Some societies attributed this to divine  intervention; the Egyptians praised Osiris for the brewing of beer and the  Greeks established Bacchus as the god of wine. Likewise, at many early Japanese  miso and shoyu breweries, a small shrine occupied a central place and was bowed  to daily. In ancient times fermentation joined smoking, drying, and freezing as  basic and widely practiced food preservation techniques. Wang and Hesseltine  (1979) note that &quot;Probably the first fermentation were discovered  accidentally when salt was incorporated with the food material, and the salt  selected certain harmless microorganisms that fermented the product to give a  nutritious and acceptable food.&quot; The process was taken a step further by  the early Chinese who first inoculated with the basic foods with molds, which  created enzymes; in salt-fermented soyfoods such as miso, soy sauce, soy  nuggets, and fermented tofu, these aided salt-tolerant yeasts and bacteria??.</p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>A  Brief History of Fermentation in the West</strong>. The origins of microbiology (other than the  general knowledge of fermented foods which existed worldwide since ancient  times) can be traced back to the invention of the compound microscope in the  late 1500s. This relatively simple tool soon revolutionized man's knowledge of  the heretofore invisible microbial world. In 1675 the Dutch merchant Anton van  Leeuwenhoek, the greatest of the early microscopists, saw and reported  one-celled organisms, which he called &quot;animacules.&quot; (Today they are  called &quot;protozoa.&quot;) The discovery electrified the scientific world of  the time. Then in 1680, using a microscope that magnified the diameter of each  object 300-fold, he looked at yeast and found them to consist of tiny  spheroids. While the protozoa were clearly alive, the yeast did not appear to  be. No connection was drawn between the existence of these tiny organisms and  the well known phenomenon of fermentation. So for 150 years after van  Leeuwenhoek's pioneering observations, it was hardly thought that these minute  organisms could be important enough to deserve serious study.</p>
				<p align="justify">				  The early  1800s saw a great increase of interest in microbiology in Europe. The  scientific period began with great advances in botany, increased interest in  microscopy, and willingness to investigate individual organisms. The two major  problems that would challenge the greatest researchers in the new field of  microbiology concerned the basic nature of the fermentation process and the  basic nature of enzymes. The scientific breakthroughs that would lead to the  unraveling of the mysteries of fermentation starting in the 1830s were made  primarily by French and German chemists. In the late 1700s Lavoisier showed  that in the process of transforming sugar to alcohol and carbon dioxide (as in  wine), the weight of the former that was consumed in the process equaled the  weight of the latter produced. The first solid evidence of the living nature of  yeast appeared between 1837 and 1838 when three publications appeared by C.  Cagniard de la Tour, T. Swann, and F. Kuetzing, each of whom independently  concluded as a result of microscopic investigations that yeast was a living  organism that reproduced by budding. The word &quot;yeast,&quot; it should be  noted, traces its origins back to the Sanskrit word meaning &quot;boiling.&quot;  It was perhaps because wine, beer, and bread were each basic foods in Europe,  that most of the early studies on fermentation were done on yeasts, with which  they were made. </p>
				<p align="justify">				  The view  that fermentation was a process initiated by living organisms soon aroused fierce  criticism from the finest chemists of the day, especially Justus von Liebig,  J.J. Berzelius, and Friedrich Woehler. This view seemed to give new life to the  waning mystical philosophy of vitalism, which they had worked so hard to  defeat. Proponents of vitalism held that the functions of living organisms were  due to a vital principal distinct from physico-chemical forces, that the  processes of life were not explicable by the laws of physics and chemistry  alone, and that life was in some part self determining. As we shall soon see,  the vitalists played a key role in debate on the nature of fermentation. A long  battle ensued, and while it was gradually recognized that yeast was a living  organism, its exact function in fermentations remained a matter of controversy.  The chemists still maintained that fermentation was due to catalytic action or  molecular vibrations.</p>
				<p align="justify">				  The debate  was finally brought to an end by the great French chemist Louis Pasteur  (1822-1895) who, during the 1850s and 1860s, in a series of classic  investigations, proved conclusively that fermentation was initiated by living  organisms. In 1857 Pasteur showed that lactic acid fermentation is caused by  living organisms. In 1860 he demonstrated that bacteria cause souring in milk,  a process formerly thought to be merely a chemical change, and his work in  identifying the role of microorganisms in food spoilage led to the process of  pasteurization. In 1877, working to improve the French brewing industry,  Pasteur published his famous paper on fermentation, <em>Etudes sur la Biere </em>,  which was translated into English in 1879 as <em>Studies on Fermentation </em>.  He defined fermentation (incorrectly) as &quot;Life without air,&quot; but  correctly showed specific types of microorganisms cause specific types of  fermentations and specific end products. In 1877 the era of modern medical  bacteriology began when Koch (a German physician; 1843-1910) and Pasteur showed  that the anthrax bacillus caused the infectious disease anthrax. This epic  discovery led in 1880 to Pasteur's general germ theory of infectious disease,  which postulated for the first time that each such disease was caused by a  specific microorganism. Koch also made the very significant discovery of a  method for isolating microorganisms in pure culture.</p>
				<p align="justify"> Interestingly,  until his death in 1873, the eminent German chemist J. von Liebig continued to  attack Pasteur's work on fermentation, putrefaction, and infectious diseases.  He recognized the similarity of these phenomena but refused to believe that  living organisms were the main causative agents. Fermentation, he felt, was  primarily a chemical rather than a biological process. History has shown, with  the discovery of enzymes, that Pasteur was not entirely right, nor Liebig  entirely wrong.<br />
				  The work of  Pasteur and his many colleagues and predecessors opened up vast new vistas in  the fields of biochemistry, microbiology, and fermentation. The term  &quot;biochemistry&quot; was first used in English in 1869, but this new  science of the application of chemistry to biology was generally called &quot;physiological  chemistry&quot; until the early 1900s. The two outstanding pioneers were Liebig  and Pasteur. The term &quot;microbiology&quot; was first used in English in  1885, long after Pasteur's major discoveries. But basic knowledge of this new  science of the study of minute living organisms closely related to human  activity or welfare did not begin to enter the popular consciousness until the  early 1900s. At about this time the scientific breakthroughs of the 1870s and  1880s had begun to produce a change in people's conception of the world around  them so sweeping and profound as to be termed revolutionary. Food microbiology  was finally set on a scientific foundation, based on the action of specific  microorganisms. A rational theory of infectious diseases (which formerly were  not differentiated from one another) set people's minds free from the age-old  fear of vengeance from an unknowable and invisible disease-causing entity. And  the ancient theory of spontaneous generation of lower life forms, which said  they could arise <em>de novo </em>and fully formed from decomposing matter, was  replaced by the verifiable theory of biogenesis. For the first time people  began to accept the fact that they shared their environment with multitudes of  minute organisms that exerted an ongoing powerful influence on human life. This  new world view, among other things, provided a tremendous stimulus for new  research on fermented foods.</p>
				<p align="justify"> Although  showing that fermentation was generally the result of the action of living  microorganisms was an epic breakthrough, it did not explain the basic nature of  the fermentation process, or prove that it was caused by the microorganisms  that were apparently always present. As early as the late 1700s it had been  recognized that there was another type of chemical change that resembled the  yeast fermentation in some respects. This was the sort of changes that occur,  for example, in the digestion of food. In 1752 Reamur, in studying the  digestive processes of a falcon, showed that its digestive juices were able to  dissolve meat. In 1785 William Irvine discovered that aqueous extracts of  sprouted barley caused liquefaction of starch. The first clear recognition of  what were later called &quot;enzymes&quot; came in 1833 when two French  chemists, A. Payen and J.F. Persoz, made a more detailed investigation of the  process of solubilizing starch with a malt extract to form a sugar that they  called &quot;maltose.&quot; They called the agent responsible for this  transformation &quot;diastase&quot; and they showed that it was destroyed or inactivated  by boiling, that without undergoing permanent change itself, a small amount of  diastase could convert a large amount of starch to sugar, and that it could be  concentrated and purified by precipitation with alcohol. In 1835 the German  naturalist Swann, mentioned above for his early work with fermentation,  isolated a substance from gastric juice which could bring about the dissolution  of meat but which was not an acid. He called it &quot;pepsin&quot; from a Greek  word meaning &quot;digestion.&quot; It soon became fashionable to call organic  catalysts such as diastase and pepsin &quot;ferments,&quot; because digestion  and fermentation, both allied with life, seemed to be somewhat similar  processes. Under the influence of the vitalists, ferments were grouped into two  types: those involved with life process were called &quot;organized  ferments&quot; and those which were not (like pepsin) were merely  &quot;unorganized ferments.&quot; A relation between the two types of ferments  was suspected by many, and in 1858 M. Traube put forward the theory that all fermentations  were due to ferments, definite chemical substances he regarded as related to  the proteins and produced in the cells by the organism. In 1876, to reduce  confusion that existed concerning the two types of ferments, the German  physiologist Wilhelm Kuehne suggested that an unorganized ferment, acting in  the absence of life, be called an &quot;enzym,&quot; after the Greek words  meaning &quot;in yeast;' in 1881 this term was anglicized to &quot;enzyme&quot;  by William Roberts, and it had begun to catch on by the 1890s.</p>
				<p align="justify">				  Many  scientists, including Pasteur, had attempted unsuccessfully to extract the  fermentation enzyme from yeast. Success came finally in 1897 when the German  chemist Eduard Buechner ground up yeast, extracted a juice from them, then  found to his amazement that this &quot;dead&quot; liquid would ferment a sugar  solution, forming carbon dioxide and alcohol . . . just like living yeasts.  Clearly the so-called &quot;unorganized ferments&quot; behaved just the  organized ones. From that time on the term &quot;enzyme&quot; came to be  applied to all ferments. The term &quot;ferment&quot; dropped out of the  scientific vocabulary altogether and the vitalist position collapsed, never to  recover. Thereafter it was agreed that only one set of laws applied to all  things, both animate and inanimate, and that there was no special vital force  which characterized living things and acted under different laws. And it was  finally understood that fermentation is caused by enzymes which are produced by  microorganisms. In 1907 Buechner won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work,  which opened a new era in enzyme and fermentation studies.<br />
				  The  sciences of microbiology, biochemistry, fermentation technology, mycology, and  bacteriology all shared a deep interest in the nature and working of enzymes.  Yet still by the early 1900s no one knew exactly what enzymes were or how they  acted. As the agricultural microbiologist Conn asked in 1901, &quot;How can  they produce chemical actions without being acted upon or entering into the  reactions? Are enzymes fully lifeless or semi-living? We still do not know the  fundamental mystery of fermentation.&quot; Gradually an understanding of  enzymes and catalysts developed. In 1905 Harden and Young discovered coenzymes,  agents necessary for the action of enzymes. In 1926 the American biochemist  J.B. Sumner first purified and crystallized an enzyme (urease) and showed that  it was a protein, more precisely a protein catalyst. Eventually enzymes came to  be seen as the key catalysts in all the life processes, each highly specialized  in its catalytic action and generally responsible for only one small step in  complex, multi-step biochemical reactions. Enzymes are still produced only by  living organisms, both animals and plants; they have never? been synthesized.</p>
				<p align="justify">				  Advances in  microbiology and fermentation technology have continued steadily up until the  present. For example, in the late 1930s it was discovered that microorganisms  could be mutated with physical and chemical treatments to be higher yielding,  faster growing, tolerant of less oxygen, and able to use a more concentrated  medium. Strain selection and hybridization developed as well, affecting most  modern food fermentations (Hesseltine and Wang 1977).</p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>A  Brief History of Fermentation in East Asia </strong>. Traditional fermented foods play an unusually  extensive role in East Asia food systems. These fermented foods have a number  of important distinguishing characteristics: a number of the most important  fermentations use molds; dairy products and other animal proteins (excepting  fish) are not widely used, as they are in the West; and modern fermentation  processes and technology are based largely on traditional processes, yet are  extremely advanced and sophisticated.</p>
				<p align="justify">				  The main use of  molds has been in the process of making koji (mold-fermented grains and/or  soybeans), which serves as a source of more than 50 enzymes in a subsequent  fermentation in much the same way that, in the West, the enzymes of malt  (steeped and sprouted barley or other cereal grains) are used to make alcoholic  beverages.</p>
				<p align="justify">				  Since  ancient times the koji making process has been unique to East Asia, where it  has been used in the preparation of fermented foods such as miso, soy sauce,  soy nuggets, sake, shochu (spirits), and rice vinegar ( <em>yonezu </em>). The  only traditional East Asian fermented soyfood not prepared with molds is  Japan's natto, and its relatives <em>thua-nao </em>in Thailand and <em>kinema </em>in  Nepal; these are bacterial fermentations. Some have suggested that molds are  widely used since they grow well in areas having a humid climate and long rainy  season during the warm months. In the West mold fermented foods are limited  primarily to a number of cheeses characterized by their strong flavors and  aromas: Camembert, Blue, Brie, and related types. Because of the widespread use  of mold-fermented foods in East Asia, the word &quot;mold&quot; there has a  rather positive connotation, something like &quot;yeast&quot; in the West. Most  Westerners still have a deep-seated prejudice against moldy products, and they  generally associate the word &quot;mold&quot; with food spoilage, as in  &quot;moldy bread.&quot;</p>
				<p align="justify">				  Surprisingly  little has been published in English about the history of fermentation and  knowledge of the fermentation process in East Asia, especially the history  prior to the 1870s and 1880s, when the new science of microbiology was  introduced from the West. The few works that do exist will be cited later.</p>
				<p align="justify">				  The earliest  records of the koji-making process can be traced back to at least 300 BC in  China and to the third century AD in Japan. Molds differ in one important  respect from yeasts and bacteria in that they can be easily observed with the  naked eye (without a microscope) and their growth, form, and color noted. In  East Asia it was probably understood that fermentation was a life process long  before it was in the West. By the sixth century AD, as recorded in the <em>Ch'i-min  yao-shu </em>(the earliest encyclopedia of agriculture), the Chinese had  distinct names for two types of molds used in fermented soyfoods; what we now  call <em>Aspergillus </em>was then called &quot;yellow robe&quot; and <em>Rhizopus </em>was called &quot;white robe.&quot; These cultures were carefully  distinguished and propagated from year to year. By the 10th century a koji  starter or inoculum was deliberately being used in the preparation of koji for  fermented foods (Tamiya 1958; Sakaguchi 1972; 1979).</p>
				<p align="justify">				  From these early  times until the 1870s the traditional fermented foods industries in East Asia  apparently advanced largely by an empirical, trial-and-error process without  the benefit of general scientific research into the nature of microorganisms and  of the fermentation process, and without any general theories in these areas.<br />
				  Prior to  1870, makers of East Asian fermented foods were unaware of the basic nature of  the fermentation process of microorganisms, enzymes, and their respective  interactions. Makers of koji had no idea what caused the grains and/or soybeans  to become covered with a fragrant white mycelium after several days of  incubation in a warm koji room, or what later transformed the koji almost  magically into delicious, savory seasonings such as miso, shoyu, or soy  nuggets, or into heady beverages such as sake. </p>
				<p align="justify">				  The advances  in food fermentations resulting from the exchange of people and ideas was most  pronounced in Japan. The first generation of European scientists there plunged  in to their investigations of the many fermented foods with great curiosity and  enthusiasm. One of their first subjects of research was the koji mold, now  known as <em>Aspergillus oryzae</em>, and the various foods in which it was used,  especially sake and shoyu, which were major sources of tax revenue for the  Meiji government. Tradition ascribed the introduction of sake brewing in Japan  to some emigrants from Korea at about the end of the third century AD; they  doubtless learned the process from China, where it had long been practiced. One  of the earliest accounts of sake production by a Westerner appeared in 1874  when Dr. J.J. Hoffmann, a German professor in the medical school of today's  Tokyo University, published a translation of an article on sake from a Japanese  encyclopedia of 1714. In 1884 Ferdinand J. Cohn, a Polish botanist and  microbiologist, first gave the koji mold its present name, <em>Aspergillus  oryzae </em>. After 1884 the koji mold was referred to as <em>Aspergillus oryzae </em>(Ahlburg)  Cohn, in recognition of Ahlburg's earliest accurate description. </p>
				<p align="justify">				  Another  pioneer in the field of koji research was Atkinson, who had a BS degree from  London and was a professor of analytical and applied chemistry at Tokyo  University. In 1878, after visiting sake factories, he wrote &quot;On Sake  Brewing,&quot; which contained a preliminary description of the koji-making process  and mentioned the word &quot;koji.&quot; In 1881, after extensive research with  his assistant Mr. Nakazawa at the koji plant of Mr. J. Kameyama in Yushima near  Tokyo, he published two major articles. In his 73-page &quot;On the Chemistry  of Sake Brewing,&quot; he gave a detailed account of koji making in underground  caves in Tokyo and an analysis of its composition. </p>
				<p align="justify">				  Another  early leader in the fields of microbiology and fermented soyfoods was K. Saito.  He did excellent early investigations on the shoyu fermentation, named the primary  tempeh mold ( <em>Rhizopus oligosporus </em>) in 1905, and was an authority on  yeasts and molds. Likewise K.N. Yabe did important early work in bacteriology  and in natto fermentation.</p>
				<p align="justify">				  Two other early  pioneers in the introduction of microbiology and fermentation science to Japan  were Dr. Teizo Takahashi (1875-1952) and his student Dr. Kinichiro Sakaguchi  (1897-), both of whom were professors in the Department of Agricultural  Chemistry of Tokyo University. Both men did numerous important studies relating  to miso, shoyu, and the koji mold, <em>Aspergillus</em>. </p>
				<p align="justify">				  During the 20th century, Japanese microbiologists have made many  important contributions to the development of applied and industrial  microbiology, including the manufacture of fermented soyfoods, as well  summarized by Tamiya (1958) and Sakaguchi (1972). Until quite recently, their  strength was more in the area of application of scientific knowledge than in  pioneering basic scientific and microbiological breakthroughs. From the early  1900s, important studies on the koji mold and its enzymes were done by Japanese  scientists. Important advances in enzymology, with much of the work done on  koji molds, began in the 1920s. In 1928 Miyazaki developed the combined  Amylo-Koji process. By the 1950s Japanese scientists had isolated various  protease and amylase enzymes, induced mutations, and used them commercially.  They also developed the technology for the microbial production of L-glutamic  acid and monosodium glutamate ( MSG), lysine and other amino acids, flavor  enhancing nucleotides such as inosinic acid, and organic acids. They used the  koji mold <em>Aspergillus oryzae </em>in the commercial production of enzymes  including proteases, amylases, amyloglucosidase, and lipase. They made  microbial rennet and numerous other products. Indeed in the period following  World War II, Japan became the world leader in the field of industrial  fermentations. Wang and Hesseltine (1979) have suggested that this may have  been &quot;in large part due to the food fermentation base from which it  launched its industrialization of micoorganisms.&quot; </p>
