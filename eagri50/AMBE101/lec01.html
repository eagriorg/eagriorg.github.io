				<p>Microbiology often  has been defined as the study of organisms and agents too small to be seen  clearly by the unaided eye—that is, the study of microorganisms. Because objects less than about one  millimeter in diameter cannot be seen clearly and must be examined with a  microscope, microbiology is concerned primarily with organisms and agents this  small and smaller. <br />
				  Microbial  World<br />
				  Microorganisms  are everywhere. Almost every natural surface is colonized by microbes  (including our skin). Some microorganisms can live quite happily in boiling hot  springs, whereas others form complex microbial communities in frozen sea ice. <br />
				  Most microorganisms are harmless to  humans. You swallow millions of microbes every day with no ill effects. In  fact, we are dependent on microbes to help us digest our food and to protect  our bodies from pathogens. Microbes also keep the biosphere running by carrying  out essential functions such as decomposition of dead animals and plants.<br />
				  Microbes are the dominant form of life  on planet Earth. More than half the biomass on Earth consists of  microorganisms, whereas animals constitute only 15% of the mass of living  organisms on Earth. <br />
			    This  Microbiology course deals with </p>

                  <li>How       and where they live</li>
			      <li>Their       structure</li>

			      The  microorganisms can be divided into two distinct groups based on the nucleus  structure:<br />
			      Prokaryotes –  The organism lacking true nucleus (membrane enclosed chromosome and nucleolus)  and other organelles like mitochondria, golgi body, entoplasmic reticulum etc.  are referred as Prokaryotes. (Ex : Bacteria, archaea) <br />
			      Eukaryotes  - The organism possessing membrane enclosed  nucleus and other cell organelles are referred as Eukaryotes (Ex : algae,  fungi, protozoa)<br />
			      The  microorganisms were divided into 6 distinct groups based on the phylogenic,  morphological and physiological characters.<br />
			      The major groups of microorganisms are</p>
			    <ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>Bacteria       are phylogenetically related group of unicellular prokaryotic organisms       distinct from archeae</li>
			      <li>Archaea       is phylogenetically related group of prokaryotes which are primitive and       distinct from bacteria</li>
			      <li>Fungi are group of       eukaryotic organisms lacking chlorophyll. They range in size and shape       from single celled yeast to multicellular mushrooms. </li>
			      <li>Algae       refer the group of eukaryotic organisms with chlorophyll. They range in       size and shape from single celled algae (Ex: <em>Chlorella</em>) to complex cellular structured plant like algae       (Ex. Kelp)</li>
			      <li>Protozoa       are group of eukaryotic organisms lack of cell wall. The morphology,       nutrition and physiology is different from other groups</li>
			      <li>Viruses are group of       non-cellular organisms, parasite or pathogen to plant, animals and other       microorganisms. They are too small and cab be visualized only under       electron microscopes</li>
		        </ol>
			    <p>History of Microbiology in brief<br />
			      Obviously human have had to deal with  microbes even before the recorded history.   The first record of human using comes from ancient tablets from mid  east.<br />
			      Babylonians were using yeast to make  beer over 8000 years ago and acetic acid bacteria to make vinegar over 6000  years ago.<br />
			      About 5000 years ago, Persia (Now  Iran) region recorded the wine making.<br />
			      The Romans had God for that were  specific for microorganisms.  The roman  God of mold and mildew was “<em>Robigus</em>”  and “<em>Robigo”</em> which means crop rust.  (Rust is one of the plant disease caused by fungus).  God Robigus was very much feared because of  crop lost.<br />
			      About 2000 years ago, Romans proposed  that diseases were caused by tiny animals.   But, fundamentalist religions had a strong hold over the progress.<br />
			      The real microbiology history starts  from 1600s, when people began to make crude lenses and microscopes.</p>
			    <p>HIGHLIGHTS IN THE HISTORY OF  MICROBIOLOGY </p>
			    <p><strong>Effects of Disease on Civilization</strong><strong> </strong></p>
			    <ul>
			      <li>Infectious  diseases have played major roles in shaping human history</li>
			      <li>Bubonic  Plague epidemic of mid 1300's, the &quot;Great Plague&quot;, reduced population  of western Europe by 25%. Plague bacterium was carried by fleas, spread from  China via trade routes and poor hygiene. As fleas became established in rat  populations in Western Europe, disease became major crisis.</li>
			      <li>Smallpox  and other infectious diseases introduced by European explorers to the Americas  in 1500's were responsible for decimating Native American populations. Example: In the century after Hernan  Cortez's arrival in Mexico, the Aztec population declined from about 20 million  to about 1.6 million, mainly because of disease.</li>
			      <li>Infectious  diseases have killed more soldiers than battles in all wars up to WW II. Example: in U. S. Civil war, 93,000  Union soldiers died in direct combat; 210,000 died as a result of infections.</li>
			      <li>Until  late 1800's, no one had proved that infectious diseases were caused by specific  microbes, so the possibility of prevention or treatment had no sound empirical  base.</li>

			    <p><strong>Discovery of Microbes</strong></p>
			    <ul>
			      <li>To  see microbes, you need a microscope. The first microscope was invented by Antony van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723), a  Dutch businessman.</li>
			      <li>Leeuwenhoek  took up lens grinding to make magnifiying glasses so he could examine fine  weave of fabrics. In testing his lenses, he discovered many small creatures he  called &quot;animalcules&quot; in samples such as pond water. His best lenses  could magnify 300-500X.</li>
			      <li>Leeuwenhoek  microscopes were crude, relied on a single lens held in a metal plate.</li>
			      <li>Leeuwenhoek  described many previously unseen life forms, including different forms of  bacteria, mold spores, etc. Leeuwenhoek reported discoveries to Royal Society  from 1670's on, firmly established existence of microbes. Nevertheless, the  significance of this discovery was not apparent for almost 200 years.                        </li>

			    <p><strong>Origin of Life Controversy</strong><strong> </strong></p>
			    <ul>
			      <li>Where  did microbes come from? Many believed they arose from simple materials by  process of spontaneous generation.  This notion had been posited by Aristotle (382-322 B.C.) and other Greek  philosophers to explain decay and appearance of animals such as flies and  frogs, and was widely held as common sense even in 1700's and 1800's.</li>
			      <li><strong>Francisco Redi</strong><strong> (1626-1697)</strong> demonstrated that flies did not arise  spontaneously from rotting meat by simple experiment. If jar of meat was  covered by fine muslin, maggots did not arise. However, the simpler life forms  discovered by Leeuwenhoek lacked visible complexity, and most people still believed  these could arise spontaneously. </li>

			    <p>&nbsp;</p>
			    <ul>
			      <li><strong>John Needham (1731-1781),</strong> a Scottish clergyman and naturalist,  showed that mirobes grew in soups exposed to air. Claimed existence of a  &quot;life force&quot; present in inorganic matter that could cause spontaneous  generation. One of his more convincing demonstrations was to boil some soup  (briefly), pour into clean flasks <img width="188" height="237" src="lec01_clip_image010_0000.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="Description: http://josephsmith.net/Static%20Images/john_needham_MD.jpg" />with  cork lids, and show that microbes would soon arise.</li>

			    <p>&nbsp;</p>
			    <ul>
			      <li><strong>Lazzaro Spallanzani</strong><strong> (1729-1799)</strong> claimed Needham's organisms came from  heat-resistant microbes. If flasks were boiled long enough (1-2 h), nothing  grew. But Needham countered that prolonged heating destroyed the &quot;life  force&quot;. </li>

			    <ul>
			      <li><strong>Louis Pasteur</strong><strong> (1822-1895)</strong> was passionate believer that life only  originated from previous life, developed several experiments that finally  deflated claims for spontaneous generation. Pasteur filtered air through cotton  to trap airborne materials, then dissolved the cotton and examined the  particulate matter under a microscope; many bacteria and spores of other life  forms such as molds were present. Since most skeptics kept arguing that  overheating killed the life force present in air, Pasteur developed and  ingenious experiment using a swan neck flask that allowed fresh air to remain  in contact with boiled materials. The long passageway prevented airborne  microbes from reaching the nutrient liquid, without impeding access to air. One  of Pasteur's flasks is still sterile after 100+ years of being exposed to the  air (Pasteur Institute, Paris). </li>

			    <p><strong>Spontaneous  Generation theory</strong><br />
			      From  earliest times, people had believed in <strong>spontaneous generation</strong>—that  living organisms could develop from nonliving<strong> </strong>matter. Even the great  Aristotle (384–322 B.C.) thought some<strong> </strong>of the simpler invertebrates could  arise by spontaneous generation.<strong> </strong>This view finally was challenged by the  Italian physician<strong> </strong>Francesco Redi (1626–1697), who carried out a series  of experiments<strong> </strong>on decaying meat and its ability to produce maggots<strong> </strong>spontaneously.  Redi placed meat in three containers. One was<strong> </strong>uncovered, a second was  covered with paper, and the third was<strong> </strong>covered with a fine gauze that  would exclude flies. Flies laid<strong> </strong>their eggs on the uncovered meat and  maggots developed. The<strong> </strong>other two pieces of meat did not produce maggots  spontaneously.<strong> </strong>However, flies were attracted to the gauze-covered container  and<strong> </strong>laid their eggs on the gauze; these eggs produced maggots. Thus the  generation of maggots by decaying meat resulted from the presence of fly eggs,  and meat did not spontaneously generate maggots as previously believed. Similar  experiments by others helped discredit the theory for larger organisms.<br />
			      Leeuwenhoek’s discovery of  microorganisms renewed the controversy. Some proposed that microorganisms arose  by spontaneous generation even though larger organisms did not. They pointed  out that boiled extracts of hay or meat would give rise to microorganisms after  sitting for a while. In 1748 the English priest John Needham (1713–1781)  reported the results of his experiments on spontaneous generation. Needham  boiled mutton broth and then tightly stoppered the flasks. Eventually many of  the flasks became cloudy and contained microorganisms. He thought organic  matter contained a vital force that could confer the properties of life on  nonliving matter. A few years later the Italian priest and naturalist Lazzaro Spallanzani (1729–1799) improved on Needham’s  experimental design by first sealing glass flasks that contained water and  seeds. If the sealed flasks were placed in boiling water for 3/4 of an hour, no  growth took place as long as the flasks remained sealed. He proposed that air  carried germs to the culture medium, but also commented that the external air  might be required for growth of animals already in the medium. The supporters of  spontaneous generation maintained that heating the air in sealed flasks  destroyed its ability to support life. Several investigators attempted to  counter such arguments. Theodore Schwann (1810–1882)  allowed air to enter a flask containing a sterile nutrient solution after the  air had passed through a red-hot tube. The flask remained sterile. Subsequently  Georg Friedrich Schroder and Theodor von Dusch allowed air to enter a flask of  heat-sterilized medium after it had passed through sterile cotton wool. No  growth occurred in the medium even though the air had not been heated. Despite  these experiments the French naturalist Felix Pouchet claimed in 1859 to have  carried out experiments conclusively proving that microbial growth could occur  without air contamination.<br />
			      This  claim provoked Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) to  settle the matter once and for all. Pasteur  first filtered air through cotton and found that objects resembling plant  spores had been trapped. If a piece of the cotton was placed in sterile medium  after air had been filtered through it, microbial growth appeared. Next he  placed nutrient solutions in flasks, heated their necks in a flame, and drew  them out into a variety of curves, while keeping the ends of the necks open to  the atmosphere .Pasteur then boiled the solutions for a few minutes and allowed  them to cool. No growth took place even though the contents of the flasks were  exposed to the air. Pasteur pointed out that no growth occurred because dust  and germs had been trapped on the walls of the curved necks. If the necks were  broken, growth commenced immediately. Pasteur had not only resolved the  controversy by 1861 but also had shown how to keep solutions sterile. The  English physicist John Tyndall (1820–1893) dealt a final blow to spontaneous  generation in 1877 by demonstrating that dust did indeed carry germs and that  if dust was absent, broth remained sterile even if directly exposed to air.  During the course of his studies, Tyndall provided evidence for the existence  of exceptionally heat-resistant forms of bacteria. Working independently, the  German botanist Ferdinand Cohn (1828–1898)  discovered the existence of heat-resistant bacterial endospores</p>

			    <p><strong>2.  Disprove of Spontaneous Generation theory</strong><br />
			      At that time, the age old idea of  “Spontaneous Generation theory” was the dominant one.  The idea that organism originate directly  from non-living matter. (Life from non-living) also called as abiogenesis (a – not; bio – life;  genesis – origin).<br />
			      Ex  : Maggots were developed spontaneously via recombination of matters in rotting  materials.  (ex meat)<br />
			      The microbiology starts when the  disprove of SG theory. <br />
  <strong>Louis Pasteur (1822 – 1895)</strong> and disproval of Spontaneous generation  theory <br />
			      He performed “gooseneck experiment”.  The nutrient of flask was heated and the  untreated – unfiltered air could pass in or out, but the germs settled in the  gooseneck and no microbes were observed in the nutrient solution. <br />
			      His concept of Germs theory of disease  (means germs are responsible for the disease not the inert mater) ends the SG  theory. <br />

			    <p><strong>Selman A Waksman, 1945</strong> identified <em>Streptomycin</em> antibiotic from soil bacterium.  He also  coined the term antibiotics (referring a chemical substance of microbial origin  which is in small quantity exert antimicrobial activity.</p>
			    <ul type="disc">
                  <li>1927-       Wrote the book on Principles of soil Microbiology</li>
			      <li>In       1939 Waksman and his colleagues undertook a systematic effort to identify       soil organisms producing soluble substances that might be useful in the       control of infectious diseases, what are now known as antibiotics </li>
			      <li>Within       a decade ten antibiotics were isolated and characterized, </li>
			      <li>three       of them with important clinical applications  </li>
			      <li>actinomycin       in 1940, streptomycin in 1944, and neomycin in 1949. </li>
			      <li>Eighteen antibiotics were       discovered under his general direction. </li>
